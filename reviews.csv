0,"in my opinion , a movie reviewer's most important task is to offer an explanation for his opinion . but with soul survivors , i'm so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into a venomous , uncontrollable rant , obligations damned . however , protocol forces me to do otherwise . rarely have i seen a director so thoroughly mishandle material . in his directorial debut , steve carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion . when the movie's camerawork isn't pedestrian , it's clich ? d . carpenter's need for close-ups , his camera following sagemiller from behind , drain the movie of any anticipation . we already know what to look for , so why should we be surprised ? and the sense of scary atmosphere , which was recently done so well in the others , is nowhere to be found here . carpenter's script relies on random twists and turns with a minimum of logic and loads of laziness . this is a movie where the ending features one character providing an explanation about the plot to another character , which is one of the lamest screenwriting devices around . and guess what ? this movie has both ! not that the main body of the film , which has sagemiller constantly running in fear or having a nervous breakdown , is anything worthwhile . since there's no captivating dialogue , no character chemistry exists anywhere . that's a huge problem , since the four main characters are supposed to be couples . carpenter can't even get the smutty scenes right , which are becoming more prevalent in pg-13 movies like bring it on and get over it . [the film was recently re-cut from an r rating to get more kids in the seats . -ed . ] when sagemiller and dushku dance together at a club , he rarely shows them in a full shot and he never keeps the camera on them for longer than a second before relating to some michael bay-style quick cuts . regardless , any sexiness in that scene is undercut by its stupidity . why wouldn't they wash the clothes in the sink or in the washing machine ? the cast , which will see better material in the future , would be wise to leave this one off their resumes . i felt sorry for affleck , who i've liked in other movies , and bentley , who was great in american beauty . and i'm not even getting into luke wilson's role as a priest . bottom line : soul survivors is so awful i feel compelled to knock on doors and warn people about it . rating : * [lowest rating] |------------------------------| \ * * * * * perfection \ \ * * * * good , memorable film \ \ * * * average , hits and misses \ \ * * sub-par on many levels \ \ * unquestionably awful \ |------------------------------| mpaa rating : pg-13 "
1,"you can watch this movie , that is based on a sci-fi work by robert heinlein , either as a straight gung-ho war film , or you can see it mostly as a spoof . anyway you watch it won't require too much gray matter from your brain cells , because you will either find this film entertaining and a feast for weary eyes , or you might , like me , "" think "" that this film is so bad that it really couldn't be this bad , i must be missing something . but i have come to the conclusion that this insipid b- movie , is that bad , despite the high production costs it took to make it . if there are any good parts to this film , it might be in the occasional sardonic one liner , such as this one , that makes light of the film's heavy assault on our sensibilities , as one soldier is telling the hero of the story , "" you're good at killing bugs . "" basically , the film should be seen as a war movie , because its spoof of the military , grew thin very fast for me , as it got carried away with the cartoon characters it has stereotyped , going for an overkill on a spoof that is so obvious in the first place , that by spending so much time with spoofing the military , is just plain unnecessary . i guess the film is set in the future , but it sure looks like the present to me despite all the computer graphics , as it makes use of its astronomical budget to become solely a computerized special effect movie , that should endear itself to the mtv generation . after awhile , all the performers looked alike to me , but i wouldn't be doing my duty as a movie reviewer , if i should fail to point out that there is some kind of melodramatic love story going down among the four stars of the film , rico ( casper van dien ) , the school football hero , loves carmen ( denise richards ) , the school beauty and math brain , who is set on becoming a pilot , which is the reason rico joins the military . i don't think you get much bang for your money out of this film , unless you are really into special effects or found this sophomoric satire funny or you are a reactionary , then i think you will find many things to like about this empty hearted attempt to put ww11 into an outer space conflagration film .

2,"this is asking a lot to believe , and though it is possible , it would have been more possible to believe if quentin possessed some charm or something about him that would give us a clue that he was such a good catch , because he sure couldn't act , and since he is the focal point of all the attention , able to have his way with either men or women , we should also have felt this electricity generated on screen , instead of being forced fed by the director into believing something was happening when we couldn't see it . just what was supposed to be so compelling about this relationship , that would make it interesting ? i'm afraid i don't have the answer , since i can't find a thing about this relationship or this movie that kept me tuned into it , as i tended to drift out of the story somewhere in the middle , and just watched for the street scenes of paris in the background , which i found to be more pleasurable viewing than the movie itself , even more erotic than the unerotic love scenes between the lovers , and this is being said by a big fan of isabelle huppert , who is usually quite engaging in the various roles she has played during her long career , but here it is embarrassing for me to watch her vacuous performance . the only problem with this , is that we didn't see how good the sex was , we had to take the word of the actors that it was so good , as dialogue came out of their mouths that is totally forgetable or regretable or whatever , but their love was not passionate or credible . there is one line from the film that summed up how i really felt about what i was seeing , when at a fashion party for dominque's wealthy parisian fashion clients , quentin tells her , "" seeing all these rich people makes me want to puke . "" quentin must be psychic or something , because he was just regurgitating what i was thinking about the characters in this film . "
3,"no heroes and no story are the main attributes for this futile attempt at a trainspotting , performance , the long good friday , and a tarantino-like gangster/comedy , all rolled into one film , served up with an eastender's sense of vile english humor , as this is writer/director guy ritchie's first feature film , formerly known for his video commercials . he tries every bit he could muster from the lore of gangster and screwball comedies , to make this film work , but still misses by a city mile . this is just a bad film . a laurel and hardy film would have looked like deep sardonic humor compared with this sophomoric effort . every character in the film tries to be a character , succeeding only in being a one-dimensional one , while women do not play a significant part in this unoriginal film , as they are reduced to being go-go girls or unnoticeable druggies . ritchie's aim for the film , is to keep the audience guessing at what is happening . the film gets carried away with trying to be too clever , as one character is always trying to top the other in craziness . the plot has its twists and turns , and it would serve no purpose telling you about it , since the heart of the film , is about the surprises and corpses it delivers . since the film's humor didn't suit me and i grew tired of seeing so many characters try to fit into such a small movie , with all of them being a composite of a boring and motley crew of stereotypes ; and , the violence didn't particularly appeal to me , either , leaving me squirming in my seat with displeasure . if you take my advise , you'd avoid this one . i think you would get more satisfaction , if you are hooked on this type of film , in seeing something like reservoir dogs , even if you must see it again , it is better than seeing this poor imitation once . "
4,"this is not an art movie , yet i saw it an art house theater . it is perfect for the mall , where teenagers experiencing brain drains can feel good about being mindless and not have to apologize that this is an american film , about that old cliche of young lovers relentlessly on the run . if seen at your friendly mall , you could , at least , be reassured that there is little chance of anyone trying to sneak it in as an art film , as was tried in the art house . rlr should make it apparent that other countries can make obnoxious films with banal and predictable characters just as readily as americans can . there is no substance in this fast food german meal , served up at a deliciously kinetic speed so that you have no time to think about how stupid the story is and how depraved the lead characters are , and what a lousy meal you have just had . the film is as deep as reading a daffy duck comic book or playing a road runner video game or watching a bugs bunny cartoon , and if that entertains you , then perhaps , i could recommend that you take a look at run lola run , it might be what you are looking for . it has the audacity to have in its opening credits a quote from t . s . in all probability , the blue-bloodied elliott would not have cared for this film- and to quote him and then have a film that has nothing in the world to do with his poem or with the quote , except to show that even these crass critters who created this film aspire to a higher art form , is simply a ridiculous attempt by them to try and achieve credibility when it is not necessary to do so , this film stands on its own four paws . these questions once asked on screen are , of course , never even attempted to be answered . though it would have been good comedic dialogue to have the two leads , lola ( franka potente ) and manni ( moritz bleibtreu ) , try to resolve these deep philosophical questions . what does take place is a soccer ball being kicked to open the action in the film , as the movie is supposed to be like a game , with the director making up the rules as he goes along . manni , not to be undone , sports a few nifty tattoos himself , while also taking on the punk look . the fun to this story , if you are going to have any , comes in following lola as she makes a run for it through spots that she will revisit three different times each for 20-minutes and with three different versions , before the film is over , as any one of the versions could be true or none of them could be true , it just doesn't matter . nothing matters , here . this is a disposable film , like junk food , when done you throw it in the waste can . needless to say , anything goes here ; this film does not try to make sense and it doesn't . its comedy is on the low end of the totem pole of comedy , though the old silent comedians , such as charlie chaplin and buster keaton did bits similar to this , but they had a logic to their madcap humor and knew how to tell a story in their comedy . there are so many films that tried this theme out for size , some successfully like rashomon ( 1950 ) , some modestly successful like blind chance ( 1982 ) , others less successfully , such as sliding doors ( 1998 ) , but none as unsuccessful as this one . at least this subtitled , low-budget film flew by quickly and leaves you no worst for wear after seeing it . . . it certainly didn't appeal to me ; i was just not smitten with its attempt to be such a cleverly edited , jejune summer film . and he replies , "" i just know . "" well , i just know i didn't like this film . "
5,"a satirical film where warren beatty tries to talk the black man's rap to get across his political message : which is that there's something wrong in politics that corrupts everyone in it . maybe he does this because he feels relieved that he's going to die soon . this is an awkardly embarrassing scene , that was more embarrassing than funny to watch beatty try to ingratiate himself this way to his black brothers . it reminded me in an analogous way of the liberals in the '60s who invited the black panthers into their wealthy homes and thought they were so chic . even frank capra wasn't that schmaltzy . the story gets too ridiculous at this point to even be satirical or credible , it is just bad filmmaking ; but it does try in its unclear and scrambled way to blame the media and the rich people who control it , for not being risk takers and offering fresh arguments into the political fray . amiri baraka ( poet & playwright ) , supposedly a voice of consciousness , plays a homeless wiseman who keeps popping up from scene-to-scene , uttering this heavy stream of consciousness rap , "" we need no more ghosts , we need a spirit . "" the fault of the film , is that beatty can't gracefully pull off what he is trying to accomplish without appearing to be smug about it , like he's the white man who knows best what to do , and that anything he does is super cool because he really cares about the blacks and the poor ( sic ) . everyone in the film is a cardboard prop for beatty to lay it into them with his political cliches . just when i thought wag the dog was the stupidest political comedy i ever saw , along comes this sophomoric venture , showing no plausible way of replacing the old lies of senator bulworth with his new so-called truths , and as a result it is a film that out wags the dog's tail in silliness and prattle , unable to have the demented bulworth say what he would do when elected , except what is implied , that the people will trust him because he's so hip and daring , and he's just so with it . there was a smugness about this film that made its childish political voice seem more annoying than it should be , even taking away any enjoyment that might have been derived from its comic efforts . beatty is just not the filmmaker i would want telling my side of the story . all he has done is make a film that is cliched and overbearing and funny in a not funny way , and he sounds no different or trustworthy than the politicians he features in the film , clinton and dole . and , i don't mean that as a compliment . "
6,"this sci-fi'er left a lot to be desired . it didn't work out in 3-d , its original intention of how it was to be shown , as the public's taste for that fad cooled , or in the conventional 2-d , how it was actually shown when released . for the first 30 minutes or so i felt i was stuck in a detention classroom for dummies ( ah ! even if these machines could do a 1 , 000 times the work man can do , they were also a 1 , 000 times deadlier than man , and this reactionary story dwells on the negative side of what machines could do , even if the machine in this instance is a magnificent brain . the action in the film , which is none too thrilling , is in watching how many of the 150 workers will get killed and what novel ways are the killings to be done . if the film was funny or its technology was more interesting , or if the killings weren't so melodramatic , and the acting not so staid , and the patriotic jingoism wasn't so shrill , i might have found this film bearable . but since that wasn't the case , i found the film to be an academic bore . "
7,"this is a dull , unfunny film , lacking an edge to it , as if the screenwriter is past his prime and maybe should take a year off to re-gain his touch . this sitcom film is actually worst than most sitcoms seen on tv ; it should have come with canned laughter . in the theater i saw it , no one laughed ; and , watching a comedy without hearing any laughs gives me a creepy feeling . the film lacked the kind of comedy expected for a satire . even if the story never took off , i at least expected the film to have some snappy things to say about those who are part of the hollywood establishment and not to mirror it so closely with the hollywood scene that it can't even be considered a parody anymore . i thought brooks mailed this script in . it was hard to think of brooks as a victim of hollywood when he was surrounded by so much wealth and the only thing he strove for was to become even wealthier . he never asked the muse to inspire him to write a great classic , only for some "" summer script "" he can sell to the studios as a blockbuster movie . if he was trying for a parody ( which i assume he was ) , he just didn't succeed . all he succeeded in showing was that there is some bitterness in him and that he's part of the "" fat cats "" who make up the hollywood scene , too complacent to make a real satire with some bite in it . but i think the main problem with the film , besides the fact that it's a one idea film , is how that idea was weak and never developed . the brooks character never spelled out why he was so desperate in the first place and he never showed us how good a writer he was . i feel i must question the film's intent : why should i feel sorry for brooks ? where is the comedy in the film ? what is this nonsense about getting a live muse supposed to mean ? what kind of statement is he making about creativity ? should i really believe that someone would have the chutzpah to make a film about a screenwriter who lost his touch and pays for a muse so he can get that touch back and makes a film that is so flat and uninspired ? is he trying to tell me that people in hollywood will believe in anything and so should i ? and there you have the funniest line in the film and it comes right in the beginning of the film . what goes for comedy in this film , has to do with his whiny relationship to the muse . that dumbness prevails , and he comes up with a lame idea for a film in which he wants to have jim carrey star in , is supposed to be his way of saying that hollywood doesn't know what's good from what's crap , or doesn't care . this is "" i love lucy "" kind of humor . that this film is about making money being tantamount in hollywood to creativity , is a theme that has been often done and this film has not touched on any new ground with that concept . if you make a satire , it better be funny , or if it is a more serious film , it should try to have a script with some characters who are profound and perceptive . to have a satire with nothing to dig into is unfortunate , as brooks chose to go for his laughs by having his character be a whiner , grousing about the demands of his muse , the attention she gives to his wife instead of him , how steven spielberg snubbed him , and how cruel it is to be in hollywood if you are a creative person . this slight aim at comedy turns this film into a slight film . if you really had to see this film , the only reason i could think of doing so , was to see the attractive sharon stone as a muse . even though the script did not provide her with material that was funny , she did show by her facial expressions and body language that she has a penchant for comedy if given a chance . at least she was more lovable than any one else in the film was . "
8,"instead he makes him an offer he can't very well refuse , stay with me and i'll give you everything you want . it all turns out to be a tedious game to see who is in control : brains or brawn . the kid plays his part like he's a lump of coal and the sex is so uninviting , making it seem just as boring as watching paint dry on a wall . and like all the characters in this film , is not developed . there is no rhyme or reason for all this sleaze to be taking place , except for making the audience into voyeurs , like the invalid . what is quickly resolved , is that glover isn't queer , just manipulaive and mentally sick . that explanation of him doesn't ring true , anyway , as he always has a blank and uninteresting look on his face , and nothing he does throughout the film is taking him to anything but a dead-end . so it becomes hard to feel anything for him , but pity and contempt . the sadistic games are better delivered now with the presence of helen , but the menage a trois doesn't have the nuances , wit , or actors to pull off the macabre effects it was trying desperately to get away with . it becomes obvious that glover has a death-wish and has been preparing all-the-time for this and now seems ready , as he reads from a poem by a zen monk who is about to die , which goes something like this-- "" in all my 56-years alive , i've seen no miracles . it is okay to die today . but even that attempt to get some life into the story fizzled , as the film just wound down trying to outsmart itself with shockers to its denouement , but ended up not being a very thrilling thriller or even living up to its reputation of being a controversial film . it was just a dull , exploitive movie , distinguished only by the fine performance of a good actor , pete postlethwaite , who was overwhelmed by being in such a trying film . "
9,"vibrant culture . great people . thinking of hanging out here for a while . eat the rich . if i got a postcard like that , i would think of getting a new best friend . this is a story which turns out to be so flat and without emotion and plays like a film you can almost swear you saw before even if you didn't , that's how forgettable and regretable the story and the acting are . it almost makes you wonder what the filmmaker is trying to say about this trite conundrum his protaganist has . the film never comes to any surprises or reveals anything you wouldn't have known if you didn't see the film . which is why , i would think the sensible thing to do for those who value how they spend their time , would be to avoid this one . at least , that's what i would do if i had it to do over . but that's not to say that the film was so terrible that it can't be seen , that would not be true , since it is not so bad as it is a case of it being so dull that it negates any enjoyment value . why toni is a poet , we have to take as a statement of fact coming from the filmmaker , because he appears like an obnoxious jerk and an actor who is badly miscast , and there was no evidence given in the film that he shows even enough intelligence to spell poet , let alone to even consider him to be a poet . chris , as a bohemian , was too pathetic to seriously believe and not funny enough to laugh at . but what was really laughable , was the filmmaker's bourgeois conception of what a bohemian is . what's left for the story to tell , are those predictable scenes of the friend who is not the friend he pretends to be , but someone who is jealous of his friend' material comforts and satisfying marriage . there's a new bresson playing . "" this film will not be mistaken for a bresson . trust me on that . the film was able to muster one great line of dialogue , and it comes from marion , as she tells her hapless hubby , "" you will get married because you are not original enough not to . "" "
10,"a "" hollow-wood "" production that couldn't be more hollow or hollywood in style , and to its only benefit , is visually pleasing . it presents a classic mysterious aura about it through scenes of thick fog , horrid decapitations , and framed shots as if it was a period art picture coming off its frame and onto the screen . but the story , that's a different story ; it is abominable . it is so ridiculous and incredulous that the filmmaker completely ruins washington irving's great short story . it is not the imaginative parable it was meant to be , but a story about a serial killer . so , you can forget the book , obviously tim burton did , that is if he ever read it . the film is not helped by a cast ( i might add a rather talented cast of british and americans ) that are sleepwalking through their parts . the two stars , who have inane and unappealing and underwritten roles , and seem to be acting as if they have no idea of what they are saying or doing in this film , but seem to enjoy playing it up for the camera , while showing no chemistry for any romance to be deemed possible between them ; which , without the two stars being credible performers , the film has little chance of succeeding . this film has box office appeal as a date movie for the high school set , comforting each other as they snack on popcorn ( which the theater owners will be largely appreciative of ) , and the teens , in all probability , will be reacting with bemused glee or mock horror to all the packets of ketchup unleashed during the headless horseman's romp through the sleepy hollow of 1799 . who else this movie should appeal to , is not for me to judge . but , when the audience leaves the theater , no harm is done , this is a totally forgettable film . there is no need to worry about nightmares over the gratuitous violence seen . this one is so obviously just a movie , that it can't even begin to match the book for its eloquence and the great manner of the book's very germane writing style , that is both lucid and thought provoking . if anything good can be said about this film , it would be that it brings back to the public's attention the forgotten writer washington irwing , someone who knew how to craft a ghost story back in the turn-of-the-19th-century and is still very readable . it's just too bad that a good movie couldn't result from such an accessible work . it's best to forget about this movie as in any way connected with the novel , the only thing that seems to jive is the time period , the location , and the character called ichabod crane ( depp ) . from here on , the movie is off on its own tangent , playing havoc with the story . in the movie the horseman is real , and the story becomes a vulgar mystery with some inept attempt to bring in an air of magical mystery to it , and it almost completely ignores the romantic rivalry between the two suitors , which was at the heart of irving's story . how a film could go so far afield , is not unusual for hollywood , but in this case the film has gone too far afield from the story to even claim it is based on the book . i would suggest reading the short story ( about 40-pages ) before or after seeing the film , and then see what you think of the film . i read the book after the film and am grateful that it called washington irving to my attention , again . otherwise , i can't say enough bad things about the film's crass aim to take away the imagination of the story and replace it with not one shred of what irving was after in his ghost story about romantic jealousy but here becoming a story about jejune classical horror images and a tacked on banal murder story . i'll admit , the movie looked good , better than most horror movies i might have raved about , but even with all the gory murders taking place and an excuse for a who-done-it movie evolving , a tedium set-in and the film seemed to lack suspense , breath and dimension ; and , like a beautiful person without much else , what else can you say that is complimentary after you say , you look good ! "
11,"it was hard to believe how bad this sophomoric spoof on catholicism is , but seeing is believing . kevin smith ( clerks/mallrats/chasing amy ) has shown what it takes to make a satire that isn't funny and one that doesn't have enough bite in it to be subversive ( it is not shocking to know that the director is a practising catholic ) . this one is a yawner , one in which i found it difficult to sit through , as its two hours of belabored effort and uninspired acting seemed longer than that ; and , it was all in the name of getting beat over the head with the director's inane indulgent musings on religion , as he tries to gross the audience out with foul language , sight gags of unpleasant sights , such as a pile of shit emerging from a toilet bowl , and an irrelevant premise for an argument against catholicism , an argument that is about as crude a one as i have heard in some time . it is also a film that left me disgusted not only because of its banal argument against catholicism , but because it was a wise-guy film , shot with a sneer , by someone without the temperament and intellectual stability to make such a metaphysical film . the filmmaker is way over his head in this attempt to combine serious argument with one of silliness , spending most of his time lecturing and moralizing the audience with his half-baked knowledge of theology and then resorting to shock techniques to get across his laborious point of view , as if it is a startling revelation he was revealing , that there is politics in the catholic church . the film's original distributor , miramax , ran into trouble with the catholic league who complained about the film's sacrilegious content and therefore forced it to be distributed by a smaller studio , lion's gate . the protestors were right about one thing , the film is offensive . but they are wasting their time protesting , this movie shouldn't be banned ( i don't want to see films banned ) . this film's only crime is that it is a revolting film and there is no reason to make it a martyr , we have enough martyrs in the world already . take my word for it , seeing god in this film is anticlimactic . that carlin , a natural comedian , is not funny in this role , a role that is ready-made for comedy , indicates how poorly things are going for smith . the premise of "" dogma , "" is that glick's church re-dedication will allow the banished angels to re-enter heaven , thus proving god fallible and , thereby , negating all existence . fiorentino and rickman are flat and unconvincing in their roles , getting neither comedy nor drama out of their performance , just giving me a mild headache listening to them deliver their vacuous lines . catholic dogma declares god's word to be unquestioned and to be a good catholic one has to accept the dogma without questioning it . the problem with these revelations , is that they are not exactly fresh news and they seemed to be delivered in such a jarring manner , as if the actors were puppets just mouthing words that seemed out of place . there was just no flow in this film , just long periods of schlock comedy and boredom and endless talking . to take this film seriously is a big mistake , which is why i have no sympathy for protestors of this film . if you got some laughs out of this mishmash , then you got more than i did from it . i just felt relieved that i sat through it and didn't walk out . smith appears to be a very limited director , he can't shoot action scenes , and his film was childish and unfocused . it was one of the most disappointing films i have seen , so far , in 1999 , especially noting how it got some favorable comments when shown in film festivals in america and abroad . what is particularly disturbing for me , is that his religious message isn't wrong -faith should not be a burden but a blessing , and his view on the corporate heads who finance films , who worship only money , is not something that i entirely disagree with , i just don't see him as the one delivering this message . "
12,"hollywood adaptations of plays rarely come off much worse than this b&w one did . there is no kind way to put it otherwise , or to say if only it did this or that the film could have been saved , nor is there reason to say , if the acting was better the film could have been bearable . the problem with the film starts firstly with the casting of the two main actors . whenever they were on screen the film was unwatchable . the first-time actress who was chosen as a result of a national talent search for a newcomer for the part , was won by the iowa teen-ager , jean seberg , who doesn't have whatever inner strength it takes to be joan of arc , at least she doesn't have it at this point of her career , and should have not been cast in that part ; her shrill voice does not make for a naive peasant girl who hears the voice of god , nor does the closing of her eyes portend that she is a visionary . richard widmark , who played the future king charles vii , the dauphin , as if he were jerry lewis in one of those stupid lewis and martin comedies of the 1950s , was not a good casting decision either . he appeared to be ridiculous emoting in his spastic gestures at the camera , as if he was in the wrong film and didn't understand that this one wasn't meant to be a comedy . the story had no emotional appeal or urgent power , and seemed like it was shot by a rank amateur filmmaker who had no idea how to get coherence from a scene and real passion from his performers , in a story that was supposedly all about passion , this one had none . it was an exercise in futility and arrogance on the part of the director , a thumbing his nose at anyone who disagrees that he is a great filmmaker and that he could make any type of film . it is no surprise that there was no audience for this film , that film critics roasted it , and that the ever-arrogant preminger sneered back at them in contempt . but if he wanted to know what joan was all about , he should have observed carl dreyer's masterpiece "" the passion of joan of arc "" ( 28 ) , and he would have seen the spiritual qualities the story was imbued with and realized that his version had failed to capture the power of the story and why the argument against the church in the story means so much to so many , and for such a long time the story poetically moved a people interested in those who have visions . that scene is my all-time favorite . it was unbelievable . its worth seeing the film just for that . with joan , all high-and-mighty on her steed , shouting out things like , "" i get my orders from god , "" this film was just too much of a brain-drainer . it was filmmaking at preminger's worst . well , if you're in joan's shoes , and you really believe you're tuned into god , you have no choice but to continue to listen to those voices in your head . what was a great actor like john doing here , and to the bargain , why was he wasted in such a small role ? maybe , if he could have played both joan and king charles this dog would have had legs ! but the film never made it seem like she was anything but a quack , committing herself to a self-imposed death , and she is always seen behaving irrationally . there was no justification for the story's outcome , no power in its presentment , and its style suffered from an ill-humor . preminger , takes a cue from one of the lines in the film , when joan says , "" i always know i'm right- because i hear the voices . "" "
13,"everything about these girl-to-girl conversations seemed forced . she does not make a loud scene , but rather lawyer-like presents her case against him . she tells connie : "" you're even older than me , and you're f * cking my daughter . "" it is awe . "" connie- whose reaction is of visible hurt , replies "" you're quite a woman , deborah . "" and that's the gist of the movie . though it does drag on for an excrutiatingly embarrassing forty more minutes , until it predictably shows harper overcoming her problems of feeling inadequate . the film heads down a road of corn ball contrivances , that kill any chance for this story to be taken seriously . it was very difficult to watch these talented performers saying all this soap opera mush , which trivialized what could have been an interesting film about a woman learning to become a woman through sex , if in the hands of a more capable director/screenwriter . polley is a fine actress and her performance when first encountering sex , is one of nervous apprehension and childish giggles . but that brief scene , as powerful as it was , was not enough to save this mawkish film for first-time director audrey wells .

14,"at best , this tv film of sherlock , is moderate fare . it suffers from wooden acting , flat direction , and trite dialogue . it was as if huston was reading his lines from cue cards , which made his confrontations with sherlock unduly dry . what the film did have going for it , was a clever plot and a few gimmicks it hung its hat on , which made it passably interesting for awhile , at least enough for me to continue watching so i could see how sherlock resolves the complicated case he is working on . this is usual sherlock stuff , except the film never had an excitement or sense of urgency to it . any romance , seemed out of the question , as the two stars seemed like cold kippers , afraid to even touch each other . in the end , everything seemed technically correct about the production , but it never had any life to it . i would chalk this sherlock version up as a mistake and , if i were in the mood to see a sherlock , i would stick to seeing any of the basil rathbone ones of the 1940s , especially his "" sherlock holmes and the spider woman . "" "
15,"i should have been so lucky to have been gone from the theater in 60 seconds ; but , i sat through this two hour remake of the slender film "" gone "" ( 1974 ) , an original film that was so shallow , everything else seen that year must have seemed deep by comparison . it's hard to get lower in moral decrepitude than this car current booster film . this was not only a bad film but a particularly annoying one . this is a jerry bruckheimer productions , which has come to stand for mediocrity in artistic value but for success in the box office , which will probably mirror how this film does , though it is a little worst artistically speaking than his other mediocre films , as if that will supposedly matter to its target audience . to make up for not coming prepared with a script that made sense , a stellar cast was hired but then was asked to do nothing , instead some gorgeous vintage cars were put on display and each was given a girl's name . everything about the story was kept hyper , as mindless violence won out over gratuitous sex , to become the major selling point of this exploitive film . the action begins right from the opening credits . the thrill of the film now becomes in watching the crew be selected , which includes angelina jolie , chi mcbride , james duval , and scott caan , none of whom are in the least bit interesting or funny . jolie seems to disappear for most of the film , only to reappear much later in the film and mumble a few inconsequential lines . there's basically no story or dialogue , the action is all packaged like commercials are with gloss and trick shots , colored filters , fast-paced editing , and all the other tricks of the trade the directors for jerry bruckheimer use to sell the action sequences . everything about this film seemed ridiculous . its logic for being could be taken apart at any point of the film . the moral bankruptcy it presented , that lindo would just let cage and his crew off the hook for all the thefts , was too much to comprehend . it was so weak to hear lindo say to cage , "" well , you saved my life , and i guess it was a brotherly thing you did for your brother , so i'm going to let you go , now get out of here before i change my mind . "" if i had my wish , lindo should go to jail for failing to do his job . the director should go to work in duvall's body shop and never direct another film . and , this senseless macho film should die a slow death at the box office , so films like this would become extinct like dinosaurs . i should be so lucky . . . "
16,"this is the last film made by the celebrated italian neorealist . it was an unbearably dull and simplistic film : poorly acted and with a vile and inaccurate depiction of jews , the scenery consisted of gaudy tv stage sets , and there was just no emotion drawn from the story . it was so badly done , that it seemed like all the figures were wooden . it therefore doesn't surprise me that this film was rarely seen , even in europe , the producers were probably happy to bury it . rossellini showed his love for film as an amateur by making short subject films . this was strictly a propaganda film and il duce's son was the film's supervisor . he made a few more fascist-commissioned films and in 1943 he shot desiderio , which was a precursor of his trademarked neorealist style to come later . together they made stromboli ( 49 ) , a film that i liked very much and thought it was underrated . he also made strangers in 1953 , which might be the best film he made during this period . the romans are made to seem like benign rulers , only too glad to please the jews and grant them their wish . the cruelty of the romans was never even hinted at . rossellini also took the religion out of jesus and made the rabbi seem as if he was merely a moralist , who was more a humanitarian and a mr . nice guy than anything else . i found this a difficult film to find anything in it that was praiseworthy . the director was trying to go back to film in his neorealism style , but couldn't even come close to duplicating the passionate films he is best remembered for . this film is only for those who feel compelled to see all of rossellini's films from 1936-1978 , the good , the bad , and the ugly . "
17,"this is one of those films that you feel ashamed you saw . the characters appear to be not as bad as they seem , or as good as they seem--they just seem to be vapid . it is a film that has no direction or sense of what it wants to say , except to look good like commercials do and with the hope that it can be accepted as a "" feel good "" movie by the kind of public that will see anything in the summer as long as the film moves fast . everything about this film is a sham , from the repulsive bar it highlights to the inane relationship it features . it felt like i was dropped into a pit with some of the most obnoxious types you would ever want to meet and was told that the only way to get out of this trap , was to shake my ass like they do . his role is to be an adult , crack some jokes , try to give the film a heart , and not to seem too embarrassed when he is reduced to shaking his ass on top of that ugly frathouse dream bar the film has created to do its flashdance formula film again , but this time without fresh music or script . his only noteworthy habit is collecting rare comic books . because of all the trickery involved , doubles for the bargirls were used . it seems odd to have only one enforcer in a place that is built for trouble , but then again , hardly anything about this film made sense . but , i'd like to see violet try and convince anyone who is not brain dead that this film has a modicum of intelligence in it . an actor could only hope to come out of a film like this unscathed , that piper perabo does , is a credit to her , which is probably due to the innocent kindergarten teacher look she conveys . the film received a pg rating , despite its image of a bar from hell . but there are no hot sex scenes to satisy an audience it might be appealing to . . . i haven't a clue who this movie will please , but it sure isn't me . "
18,"this one's a bomb . it's a total special effect film , sapping away what is human about the characters , while unsuccessfully putting the human characteristics into the haunted house . the house is the star of the film and the actors are the props . this insipid horror story has little to recommend it ; it wasn't scary , or campy , or well acted , it was just unimaginative . the few thrills it offers , are all a result of special effects . this is a date film more than anything else . the real horror it provided , was zapping shirley jackson's very literate psychological thriller . a far better film version , one that was actually thrilling , is the one done in 1963 by robert wise . the director of this film , jan de bont ( speed/speed 2/ twister ) , is not up to dealing with a psychological story and directing characters in a persuasive way , he is more into making silly theme movies that rely solely on special effects . the man just can't make a literate film . this house is haunted hollywood style , as the gothic house , which theo describes as a cross between something charles foster kane would build and the munsters' house , becomes the central focus of the film and the insomniacs stay away trying to look afraid of what they are seeing . it's all hokum from beginning to end , and it is so poorly scripted , that tedium quickly sets in , leaving the film with no purpose except to be laughed at for how stupid it all is . since this thriller was never thrilling , it just went on to show off the stage set designs illustriously created by eugenio zanetti , all one could do was go from room to room and stare at the cherubs , the leaping skeletons , the elaborately built stairway collapsing , an animated hand of a ghost coming out of the fountain , and at the futile effort to make a disney fantasy picture . after the film exhausts itself with its fake horror show and we see the ghost of hill house chasing after nell , the film gets a few laughs it never intended to get , as it concludes as a show-off will , when he is so proud of his wealthy house , that he thinks he has really impressed you , and continues to show-and-tell long after one has lost interest . the laughs that were gleaned , are of the kind that do not bode well for the film , they are the laughs that come from those who know they have just seen a bad film . "
19,"the simple message this one-note film envisions , is that one should never be who they are not . the debut feature of jamie babbit is unabashedly awkward and to make matters worse , she can't get the cast to stop mugging for the camera . the comedy was lame , the characters were not interesting , only the idea was good if it could have been developed into a story with more dimensions than the one it belabored . the stupidity of trying to force someone against their will from being a homosexual , is treated as a heavy-handed 'saturday night live' satire routine . there was not enough of a story for it to be released as a movie . it was painful to watch this kind of kitsch for 80 or so minutes , which seemed to drag on for a hellish eternity . it is just as tortorous watching this film as it probably is going through such an indoctrination program . he is also the groundskeeper making sexual gestures with his chain-saw , who camps it up to the point of going over-the-top , losing all proportion for his character as being anything but a cartoon figure . his exaggerated gait and suppresed gay tendencies never materialized as funny stuff , just a bad script he was stuck with which was made more unbearable by his obnoxious performance . all the boys in the camp were sorry sights , offering neither comedy nor concern for them . clea is the only one in the film who belonged in this film and made the most of her role , making it believable as the rich bitchy girl who knows damn well that she's a lesbo , but also knows that if she doesn't go through with this farce of a rehab program , her parents will take away the trust fund she stands to inherit . the absurdity of the film is highlighted in its loud set designs , as the girls are overwhelmed with garish pink and tangerine colored outfits and room furnishings , while the boys are furnished with this hideous bright blue color . the other absurdity is in how artificial the planned steps are and how meaningless it is to graduate from a program such as this one . this is not a good campy film , and to the bargain , after trying to get laughs for the first half of the film , it then starts to take itself seriously . but the theme is so absurd , that there really is no message that can be delivered . everything about it is strained . she seemed to be going for the hammy sweetness she thought her role required and when the comedy part of the film was over and she had hot pants for graham , there was no spark on the screen to give the affair any life . it all seemed manufactured , leaving the film telling its joke to an audience they believe will be sympathetic . the problem with that is , the one-note joke ran dry a long time ago . i just couldn't wait for the film to end . if you are going to make a campy b movie , then it takes more than crudeness and over-the-top performances to make it funny . i'll take my campy film with no pretenses to art . . . let it be a film that is bitingly hilarious ( ok , just funny will do ) . "
20,"another pretentious film from the director lawrence kasdan ( the big chill/ silverado/ grand canyon/wyatt earp ) . i never saw a film of his that wasn't arty-farty . the film suffers from an interminable case of blandness and exhibits an unwillingness to go beyond its cute little tale to see the dangers of someone who invades another's personal privacy by pretending to be someone he isn't , especially in a critical field such as the mental health one . in other words , the film makes the assumption that anyone with sensitivity could be a psychologist . this film was so weak and misleading in purpose , its story so dry and unconvincing , that it was a chore to just watch it and not give up on its arrogant attitude . it seemed to get stuck on itself and had no movement for the longest period of time . the film also makes no attempt to show anything about mumford's character or his inner being , except by telling the mere biographical data a tv news report might tell about someone arrested as an impostor . mumford remains as bland and unknown by the film's conclusion as he was throughout the film . this is stupidity glorified beyond a point of belief . there was nothing this film had to say that made any sense , and to top it off , there was no comedy in its attempt to be a screwball comedy . frank capra used to make social films like this in the '30s and '40s , but those goody-goody themes have long been played out . if they weren't , they would still be making films like that . i found the last vignette particularly phony and disconcerting , since the film has the arrogance to say that her illness is merely psychological , which goes against most evidence of the disease and discredits those who suffer from this very real illness , as they know that its physical nature is very serious , and their treatment requires a competent medical doctor seeing them , not a quack . there was nothing fantastic about this fantasy film , not even the fantasy . it was a film that tried to make you feel good about your problems and tried to show how they would go away if you can just get someone to listen to you : anyone . it was meant to be a likable film like elevator music is meant to be not upsetting , as a sort of universal music of acceptance . in both cases the effort wasn't worth it , by trying to be so bland it had more of a negative effect than if it was trying to say something worthwhile . this was a film made up of phony characters , whose problems were surface deep and were covered in the most superficial of ways . it was hard for me not to see this film as an excuse to justify doing something that is criminal and then explaining that it is ok , look at all those who were helped . if we followed the film's logic , then it would be ok for someone to pretend to be a surgeon , as long as he operated successfully . "
21,"the director has gone after style and has thrown substance out the window , as the film follows this war of words as it escalates into an ugly scene of macho posturing and then into gore . the film was a clear imitation of a hong kong action film . the protagonists were three unlikable snobs , concerned with their image , talking about name-brand products as if someone was an idiot who didn't adhere to their tastes , and getting into the tussle because they were loudly attacking the other table for being tacky . this unoriginal film has nothing to say about these faceless executives or their counterpoints , who up the dissing into physical violence . zippo is one of those villains who just can't seem to die ( i suppose he's supernatural ! ) . shundo ohkawa's direction is meant to be glossy , high-tech , but suffers from being amateurish and outdated , overrun with trick camera shots to capture the violence . the director's color scheme was nightmarish and depressing , some scenes were smothered in metallic blue shadings . the film was about as uninspiring as reading gq . the only fun in the film , was in the opening scene , watching the two tables trade smart-alecky digs at each other , other than that this film was as much fun as watching someone get hit over the head with a bottle . "
22,"a sensuous romantic comedy , about as appealing as your average lightweight tv sitcom . there is no special ingredient on the menu for what is dished out , its the kind of stuff i've seen before and was made nauseous by its silly idea of love and what it thinks is funny . the film plans to exploit the beauty and sweetness of its delicious star pen ? lope cruz , who plays a brazilian chef with a magical touch for bringing out the spices in her preparations , the aromas just sensually waft from her cooking pot , but who can't get by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story . pen ? lope was wonderful in pedro almod ? var's "" all about my mother , "" but here she is so visible in such a stale story , where she can only smile and tease the audience by having us see a constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking , that she somehow looks ridiculous , as if she got egg all over her face . the best you can say about her , is that she's not to blame for this picture being so off . this exploitation of sex film without even delivering nudity or sex , is in my opinion , worst than a raunchy film that delivers what it says it will . we don't see her in flight , so i can't tell how she handled her motion sickness problem -- unless she flew the plane . the show gets so big , that the network honchos come onboard , taking it national . these tv scenes were not only bad stereotype scenes of tv honchos , they were revolting . it was an insult to one's intelligence . i'm sure that i'm not spoiling the ending for anyone , when i tell you that toninho reforms his macho ways and together they cook up a meal that breaks her spell of loving him again . it was so awkwardly done , that it had no sense of truth or humor to it . this film might as well have been made by the same network guys featured in this film , because it doesn't look or feel like an almod ? var film , the type of film it aspired to be , but more like a film that was interferred with from above . its more like a futile commercial film that is more annoying than charming and more dull than chic , as it searches for box office heaven . "
23,"nobody can save this bomb from it's own stupidity and arrogance in filmmaking and arrogance in believing that this is a positive religious-type of film . it's just a pile of dreck . . . an ill-conceived exploitive project , a pyrotechnical film . "" end of days "" aims to be an apocalyptic thriller . it features an idiotic script , a hack director , and a one-dimensional star who is past his prime . . . which makes this film dumber than dumb , plus it's not funny , not campy , or is it in the least bit entertaining . it's just dreary and unwatchable . . . a big-budget slasher film . the only trouble with all these high-budget action sequences , was that it lacked purpose and even entertainment value . the story was so terrible and inaccurate , that it did not have an iota of value or credibility . mercifully the movie drags to a final confrontation in times square , trying unsuccessfully to build tension to the countdown toward the year 2000 . . . . accordingly , you just put a "" 1'' in front of it-- and bingo -- you get "" 1999 . '' with logic like that , this film might even think it pulled the wool over the viewer's eyes and got away with such a febrile explanation of the occult . this film should become a classic used by film schools in how not to make a horror film . i highly recommend seeing it for that purpose . "
24,"the title is taken from the writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of a traveler as 'anywhere but here . ' there isn't one thing about this mother-daughter relationship melodrama that felt honest . if the film looks familiar , that is because "" the slums of beverly hills ( 98 ) "" went over the same ground but was fortunate to be more comical and perceptive due to alan arkin and natasha lyonne performances , in which they were fortunate to have a much sharper script to work with . alvin sargent's script was weak and annoyingly claustral . wayne wang's ( "" the joy luck club "" ) inept direction made a weak script even weaker by his inability to tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating what the action couldn't convey . so it becomes a question of who knows best , as the ladies fight it out between them , until the predictable sweet ending comes in this yawner . but the transition of her life into beverly hills had no feel of reality , as everything seemed staged and unemotional . this of course results in the corny ending , showing that mom's heart was always in the right place , only she went about it in the wrong way . this was just one of those films where you want to be anywhere but in the theater where this film is showing . "
25,"chocolat by lasse hallstrom is a thoroughly manipulative and indigestible art-house , comedy-drama , fluff film . every character is a clich ? , everything about the story is predictably smug . it is so easy to make fun of the one-dimensional villains and feel morally superior to them . i grew nauseous from how bourgeois this film was in attitude , where even the rebels are merely lovers of sweet things . i found not much about the film that i enjoyed ( though the cinematography was beguilling and the cast was adept ) . it was a labor just to sit through it and not gag , while waiting for the inevitable preachy sermon that comes at the end , so even the church is redeemed for its unchristian attitude toward strangers . lasse hallstrom has come down a few pegs after his more engaging recent films "" my life as a dog "" and "" the cider house rules , "" as he couldn't pull this fairy tale off without being tainted by the mediocrity of it all . this film got nominated for an oscar as best picture , which should show you what kind of films hollywood falls in love with . this contrived turn-around was just too much for me to digest without getting sick from all the sugar i was taking in . "
26,"this one's a dry turkey . it has a good idea for a suspense thriller , but it is poorly scripted and executed . this fine ensemble cast is stuck in an unwieldy production , where characters have a lost look in their eyes . it's no wonder , they must realize that all they have to look forward to in this film is a contrived ending . the film sets for itself some lofty themes -- destiny , fate , mortality -- which are never fully explored with any depth , as the story describes the lives of some toronto citizens 12 hours before a bloody shooting spree in a trendy coffee shop . the film opens showing one version of the shootout in the coffee shop but in its concluding version , it shows the same shootout but with different results . the film's strategy is to show how one can change their plans and either avert a catastrophe or run right into it , which is hardly a fresh premise . but if done right , this film could have been worth the effort , even if many films have done the same theme before . all this movie does , is play with time and structure in too obvious a way , and because the plot is so heavy-handed , there are no chills in it . "
27,"in this less than routine thriller , the cops and a philanthropist are the bad guys . it adds nothing to the situation . every character was one-dimensional , the story line was crass , the directing was more suited for a tv show than a feature film , the acting was stiff , and the cinematography was unimaginative . i can't think of one thing i liked about the film . "
28,"this is one of the dumbest films i have ever seen . garland is one stupid lady in this film . the two things that are positive about the film are : beverly garland is a looker and the film is an oddity . but this film is only for beverly garland fans , which i count myself as an unofficial member . "
29,"there's slim pickings in this shamelessly contrived melodrama built around a wal-mart setting . all the contrived sitcom scenes just never click . it's a film about a vulnerable , low-class , and stupid woman , but a woman who is good-hearted . the result is a predictably boring film which neatly ties up all the loose ends by its conclusion , whose heart lies where the schmaltz is . the film appears to be one big advertisement for the giant department store and its generosity to its trailer park clientele . novalee will almost blow her chance of real love , by thinking she's not smart enough for forney . but , wouldn't you know it , there's a happy ending , as novalee finally makes a smart decision and marries forney . this is a film that got itself stuck inside wal-mart and could never get out of aisle 5 . director williams , he once directed the roseanne tv show , uses the material adapted from billie letts' best-selling novel to keep everything as dumb as he can . "
30,"and now the high-flying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics , and it isn't pretty . this time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer , a version of dumas's the three musketeers . by bringing in popular asian actor/stunt coordinator xing xing xiong -- whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez -- our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting . the end result is a tepid and dull action/adventure rip-off that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu . the story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay . director peter hyams ( end of days ) obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles , but here it's a disaster . one problem is that , in reality , most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones . jet li's high risk is a rip-off of die hard -- not the other way around . ironically , there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all -- maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes . most asian action films carry the bulk of their production with 20- to 30-minute action sequences , because they know the scenes have to carry the picture . chambers' d'artangnan isn't a musketeer -- he's a mouseketeer ! and hyam's use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of 17th century paris are well-noted , but that's the only standout in an overall flat production . rating : * 1/2 |------------------------------| \ * * * * * perfection \ \ * * * * good , memorable film \ \ * * * average , hits and misses \ \ * * sub-par on many levels \ \ * unquestionably awful \ |------------------------------| mpaa rating : pg-13 "
31,"susan granger's review of "" the musketeer "" ( universal pictures ) hollywood launches another assault on classic literature with this $50 million adaptation of alexandre dumas's novel that's strong on action but weak on drama , fusing hong kong martial arts with 17th century swordplay . filmed in southern france , the scenery , sets and costumes are spectacular , but the lighting is too dark and editing is filled with choppy , restless mtv'ish cuts . as the swashbuckling d'artagnan , bland calvin klein model justin chambers buckles where he should be swashing , totally lacking on-screen charisma , not to mention acting skill . mena suvari , so impressive in "" american beauty , "" seems like a contemporary interloper in the royal court . on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" the musketeer "" is a cinematic but shallow 3 . not this time 'round . "
32,"this is a movie made for those who enjoy bad films . it's an exploitation teen movie with no redeeming social or entertainment value . it also fails to deliver any messages , to raise social consciousness , or to succeed as an artistic film . it's just a badly scripted and acted film , that by being so terrible might provide a few chuckles for the discrete viewer who likes looking through trash . the film ends sugarcoated with false piety and some idiotic questions are asked about the kids ; such as , where will the kids go ? the only question i had , was why make a film like this ? this film was as real as a snowball in hell . "
33,"one of the most obnoxious sci-fi films ever . it offers hollywood's silly response to the 1950s red scare sweeping the country and promoted by the mccarthy senate hearings looking for commies under every bed cover . to realize how dumb this cold war film is , try this summation of the plot on for size : can it be that the martians are signaling earth and that their leader is that actually uttering the very word of god ? warning : spoilers are throughout review . this is one of those really bad propaganda films that has no entertainment value , as it shows how paranoic this country can be and how it can use religion at the drop of a radio signal to promote materialism and christianity as a superior way of life than communism . this one might be the strangest and most twisted red menace films of all time . the last message heard from mars is an abbreviated one ( thank god ) : "" ye have done well my good . . . "" then there is just silence . don't ask me to explain how all of a sudden ninety percent of the world workforce would lose their jobs and there would be a run on the banks because of this message . but that's exactly what this filmmaker is asking us to believe . but just when things look bleak for the free world , a spiritual message comes delivered on a different frequency . it's christ's "" sermon on the mount . "" this red scare movie is made for zombies from another planet , or witch hunters who want to justify how their dirty work is necessary . it's a classic in a negative sense , a must see for those who can't believe how a bad film can really be bad . "
34,"his life is a dreary , loveless mess . this film is noted for showing the slum side to beautiful oslo , where we see crime , ugly buildings , the subway , and problems outsiders do not associate with this peaceful and scenic country . the film spends most of the first half of the movie showing him to be a screw off , everything he touches he fouls up , a complete loser-- there is a long tradition of hollywood comedians who have exploited that avenue of comedy . his comic effect , is a deadpan expression , that absorbs all criticism that comes his way . what is funny , is the way he looks at us , as he looks at the camera , showing us his hurt feelings and pathetic nature , emphasizing to us that he is a natural screw up . but the picture has darker ulterior motives than that , it will chuck out all the work it did setting up the film as a fluff piece of comedy and go for the criminal aspects to the story , a decision that has to change how we approach seeing this film , we can no longer be content to relax , laughing at this inept mailman , we have to now see how he handles himself under fire , while the director , also , tries to bring romance into the story . as far as i am concerned , the film loses track of what it is capable of doing at this point of the story , and it becomes a different film , where one contrived situation after another occurs to keep the story suspenseful , with the buffoon-like georg menacing roy . roy is now the subject of a film that doesn't know if it wants to be viewed as a suspense or romance yarn , or just as a plain comedy . roy still acts with the same deadpan expression , as a result , everything becomes muddled and ridiculous . the laugh situations seem forced , the romance absurd , and the suspense unreal . at best , i found this film to be a modest effort at comedy , that results in a modest film , barely being less than annoying , but redeemed by showing me the darker side of oslo , a side that i have not seen before on screen . so i think that this first time director , who is guilty of trying to come up with too many different twists to the story , and by relying on a hero to carry the film who is not very likable , and a story line that is very thin , has defeated the comic efforts that he was successful with during the first part of the film , but by the end of the film , wears down to a barely passable effort at comedy . "
35,"wonderland is a rather sugary romance film that is as subtle as a ton of bricks falling on you . you can see its plot developing from a mile away . you that this is a dating film , about singles who for reasons of fate or luck , or whatnot , have not had a successful match and are now putting most of their energy into fulfilling their careers , is nothing new , this type of film has been done often and better many times in contemporary films . the fictionalized documentary unmade beds did it more provocatively and with more of a sense of urgency than this film . the it is cornball sitcom stuff , but , at least , it is handled as best it could be by the actors and director . it is easy to like erin , she is bright , caring , and attractively blonde . this sub-plot was as obnoxious to see take place as it is to hear told . anyway , as expected , all's well that ends well , for this watchable piece of fluff , that comes over on screen better than it does when relating its story-line . the dialogue was actually not bad , those dating erin or trying to flirt with her seemed to be uttering authentic things they would actually say in their situation . "
36,"she doesn't love me . but even these words don't make sense , as we find out soon afterwards , that their wife definetly loves one of them more than the other . it ends up looking not quite like a john cassavetes independent film should look . it seems to be written as if someone thought that it would be cute to keep leaving out key parts to the story . as a result , the film suffers from incohesiveness , but because of the caliber of actors involved , they make a cassavetes sandwich seem like it is a cassavetes sandwich , even if there is not much real cassavetes in the sandwich . in other words , the story just wasn't there , it didn't seem to be original , and this from a script by the real mccoy of indie films , is astonishing , to say the least , even the ending of the film feels like a blatant rip off of the graduate . the film , however , managed to be entertaining . it just mostly lacked insight into what these characters were about . nothing was resolved or could be fully understood . for example , it made no sense to think that eddie was well enough to be let free from the institution and still didn't know that he was there for a decade not for three months . too many other things about the movie were either murky or didn't add up , unless you are willing to except anything goes as a satisfactory story line when it comes to dealing with those who are unstable . what worked for me , was the comic reactions by both stanton and travolta , it broke the heavy barrage of emoting from the penns . i also thought that gandolfini did an excellent job in his brief appearance on screen . he held my attention with his mix of manic sadistic moves and cruel humor . without them , this film would have taken itself too serious for the untasty cassavetes sandwich it was trying to serve its too willing captives in the audience .

37,"this rambling , marathon of an epic movie , aspiring for greatness in filmmaking but in reality is a real snoozer , erupting for a few electrifying scenes , and going on for what seemed an eternity , to tell the 50 years of yugoslavian history by dividing it into 3 parts : the german invasion in 1941 , the cold war-tito socialist state period , and the ethnic cleansing and war period in 1991 . the best scenes are the ones that featured the brass band , used from the opening invasion scene , where we see the band march raucously over the ruined landscape , for no particular reason , and then is used intermittingly throughout the film . it woke me from my snooze each time , and gave life to a film that needed resuscitation . a film that tried desperately to find humor in its madcap antics and absurd characterization of individuals , which i understand to be political jibes , but i still found them to be made in a heavy handed manner and were not funny . the most memorable scene here , is the zoo being bombed by the nazis and the animals running free , which is example of another too obvious piece of symbolism . all the deceptions and hypocrisies of the leaders are reiterated over and over , along with the filmmaker's yearning for a unified country , this is done an unnecessary amount of times , until it becomes annoying to see every image as a symbol of the same theme . what saved this film from bombing out completely , was the excellent technical skills of the director and the robust performances from the two male leads , and because this part of the world is in the news again with its problems that draws us into their civil wars , having started the century with its ethnic conflicts and will end the century with its problems still not resolved . other than that , i couldn't wait for the film to end . "
38,"their romance is believable as long as the story remained in scotland . this is all trite and , for me , unlikely stuff . therefore the animated george of the first half of the film , is reduced to being a passive tourist , everyone showing him a thing or two about their country , and the film flounders , caught between a soft romance and a soft political treatise , accomplishing neither one very successfully . george does the sensible thing for a highly emotional person to do , he splits from here and heads for glasgow , supposedly a better person for having loved abandoningly and made a little bit more politically aware of how bad the contras are by his unexpected adventure . i expect that he'll really have something to say in the pubs when he gets back home , where he belongs . it really wasn't that bad of a film , it was just too flat and preachy . but it was pleasant to watch oyanka cabezas , she was quite innocently alluring , giving her role an authentic tone to it , as there were moments when the story seemed to be reaching for something important to say , and that she would be the best spokesperson to present the cause . but in the end , the film never managed to be all that convincing , probably because it sold its product too hard . and that is unfortunate , because i didn't learn anything new about the nicaraguan political situation that i didn't know before . everything seemed too pat , more like a stanley kramer liberal political film than a former ken loach politically independent film , such as his land and freedom . "
39,"well , this cure might work on film , and who knows , this information might have some medical merit that i am not aware of , but as part of the plot , stefan as the healer , ingratiating himself with the composer to break his musical silence and give it all for the world of music , started to give me a headache , as it reminded me of all the formula films of this nature that i have sat through in the past , thinking that this easily could have been the theme of a sports film or a multitude of other films , and that the splendid idea that opened the picture was about to be destroyed by contrivance and implausibility . o great muses , where are you when the filmmaker needed you most ! the moral of the story centers around whether you believe one's self-sacrifice for the good of the world is a genuine and necessary one , or that unfilled desires are the height of all deceits . these and other interesting questions could have been delved into , if the plot wasn't so ludicrous , and if the film wasn't so uninspired , as to make it almost unbearable to stomach . tis a pity ! "
40,"the first problem i have with this film , is why this title , since there is not one single thing about this film that pertains to the myth of jesus . i understand the title comes curiously enough from a philologist , ernest renan , whose idea of christianity was the basis of the script . but this inarticulate film failed to convey any religious feeling , and therefore it made no sense to keep that misleading title . the "" life of fred "" would have been a more appropriate and less insulting title . dumont shot this film almost like a straight documentary , using lots of close-ups on the youngsters , with long stretches of nothing much happening on the screen , cinema verite style , except the annoying sound of motorbikes racing through town , as it traces the life and lives of a troubled bunch of youngsters , with nothing to do but ride their bikes , play chicken with passing cars , hurl racist slurs , and pay no heed to what is happening in the world , as they cannot fit into society , and are angry at their state of being . though it should be pointed these are not criminal kids , just the regular garden variety of locals . it is a film where nothing happens , but boredom is rampant , where a sentence of dialogue makes us pick up our ears , as if something is being said that must be heard and we don't want to miss it . but we soon learn that nothing that is said is meaningful . these youngsters are not likable or approachable , even watching them on film is chilling , as they are so unmoving , that it is easy for the mind to wander and think what a waste of time this is , what's the point , one can get gloomy just by watching these misfits hang around doing nothing . in the end , there is just a feeling of impotence here , that there is a major problem out there in society and there does not seem to be one single answer to solve it . this is the kind of film you might see once and you get all that you possibly can from it , as it is hauntingly told , but there is no point in seeing it again . it is such an ugly story , and since it would have been more suited to be a documentary than a feature movie , as it offered no drama or enjoyment in the viewing of it . it was more fit to be a primer for the ills of society put under the microscope , and how aimless a young man can be , and uncommunicative , that he so easily loses the one person who could have held him in check . if this film was trying to be told from a christian perspective , that what these kids needed was religion and moral values , then it certainly did not make its case . there are just no answers here for what happened that can make sense . "
41,"in this kidpic , which is a very safe movie to make in today's iran , as even with the intolerant dictator khomeini dead , and a more liberal regime in its place , there is still no room for anything but subtle dissension to get sneaked into the story , because of strict censorship , and the most fertile ground to do that sneaking in , is in a type of film like this one , where there is no challenge to the ongoing political system and its fundamentalist religious system , as everything is seen through the children's eyes . the only thing , is that i couldn't pick up any subtle attacks against the regime . maybe it was too subtle for me to pick up , or maybe there was no dissensions , this was just meant to be a tear jerker of a film . the story is guileless . it is about a lost pair of shoes and a shared pair of sneakers , which if it was an american film and didn't give me a chance to see a country such as iran , which i am unfamiliar with , but curious to see how it looks under this new regime , i would have been really disappointed at how weakly structured it was . but because it is iran and i am aware how difficult it is to make a film under censorship there , i am more tolerant of its flaws than i ordinarily would be . why he doesn't tell his teacher about this problem , i don't understand , especially since his teacher seemed like a kind man , and , since this might be a problem that is not that uncommon in a school where a lot of the children are poor . but , then again , if he did that , that might have taken away the reason for making this slight film , in the first place . if this film was made in the states , its theme could be , the ny state lottery theme , "" you gotta be in it to win it . "" during the race , the filmmaker pulls out a bagful of cinematography tricks and borrowed shots from other directors to make the race an exciting one , but a race that left me unimpressed with what kind of point the filmmaker was making . if one , could summarize , how this feel good iranian version of that old hollywood standard formula works here , tugging at the audiences' heartstrings every chance it can get , as quickly as tears fall from ali's wide oval eyes and a frown covers zahra , as whenever bad news comes her way , which is most of the time , we see a frown appear on her . i assume , what the film is trying to say , is see how you must solve your problems on your own , don't blame it on the government . i guess the point being made here is , both girls can be generous and have learned how to live with their poverty . the father's poverty reflects the director's own background , which is why the family is so touchingly portrayed but in such a manipulative manner , that it fails to be as convincing a portrayal as it could have been , if done in a more free flowing form . the father is seen as a true believer , never questioning authority , deeming everything to be in the hands of god , whereas his religious beliefs are so strong , he would not even take a piece of sugar that he is chopping up for the mosque to have for his tea . this display of moral rectitude , reveals how simple things can be if you just have faith and perseverance to endure life's hardships . is this what the film is really trying to say ? but as an impactful film , it falls on its face with a thud , unable to make heaven seem to be a real place for children , where everything that is bitter is shown to be really fine despite what appears to be not so fine : rich people are not bad they can be nice , schools are not that rigid they can be accomodating , religion is unquestioned but that is because it is necessary , being poor can make you sad but it is not the worst thing in the world , and obedience is sometimes difficult to understand but it can be rewarding . "
42,"this very ordinary story is related in soap opera style , evoking heart tugging sympathy for the victim . how could you not feel sorry for her ? the steven rogers's script adds a bit of conflict to the story by having the mother-daughter relationship be strained . that took care of that little conflict . at this point of the film , i was hoping for some comedy or music to break out , like someone singing : matchmaker , matchmaker , make me a match . . . this film just couldn't move me with this familiar storyline ; its purpose was to try and get me so misty eyed for these two nice people who can't find romance together . but by the film's conclusion , there is the predictable happy ending , with the virtues of a nuclear family back in tack . i guess this is ok , because you really can't root against them , and the way this film was slowly moving along , with lots of wasted artistic shots of the small-town that had no impact on the story ; at least , it satisfied an audience who would appreciate seeing such a clean-cut and prosaic romance . it was truely a woman's picture . the nicest thing about this film was that it made for pleasant viewing . there was nothing to really get upset about . sandra bullock is very pretty and very nice . and then one day i looked and i was gone . "" that is also commendable . the problem with all this , is that these topics are very similar to the real life situations of many americans , but this film adds no new insights to the problems or any kind of humanity to it . it just ends on an uninspired happy note . it , therefore , was unable to rise to the emotional level needed to sustain a sense of drama . the result is : that there is nothing special about this film to recommend it , nor is there anything particularly horrid about it to urge you to avoid it . "
43,"this wasn't a bad film , as much as it was a mediocre one . it is taken from a paper thin story by the renown pulp writer of the vox populi , john grisham ( the screenplay is credited to al hayes , but rumored to have been re-written by robert altman ) . it was directed with misdirection by the legendary director robert altman ( m * a * s * h ( 69 ) , mccabe & mrs . miller ( 71 ) , the long goodbye ( 73 ) , nashville ( 75 ) ) , who has never directed a thriller quite like this one before , and shows with this film that his enormous talent , probably , does not lie with this genre . the only thing that saves this movie from being a complete bust is the marvelously energetic cast . they took this inane formula story seriously and did a fine job in keeping it going . branagh might be a capable british shakespearian actor , but he has a tendency to chew up his scenes , which he does here , to the further detriment of the film . that altman did such a haphazard job in directing this thriller , is proven in the first fifteen minutes of the movie , when he gives away the plot by anxiously holding his attention too long on an obvious set-up situation . as a result , with all the tension taken out of the film , in the very beginning of it , the only reason for seeing the rest of the film has become dissolved into watching how well the actors could work without a well-developed story . when the best part of the movie for me , is watching the hurricane take place , and i know that the weather conditions has little to do with the story , except as setting a mood , then i'm certain that i haven't been swept away by this film . there was , as far as i could tell , no particular character development of the principal players , no intense drama taking place , no new insights into the judicial system , or compassion felt for any one remotely connected with this story . i found myself trying to figure out why there is such a huge market for grisham's stories , and it sure beats me . . . the film becomes an actor's studio venture , with the following characters acting out their supporting roles with varying degrees of effectiveness : clyde pell ( robert downey jr . ) appears to be the most likable one in the film , playing a fun-loving alcoholic private dick and buddy of magruder . they all make an earnest contribution to a film that would have served altman better if it wasn't so thin a story he was telling . "
44,"this independent film written and directed by eric bross has the look and feel of all those other troubled blue-collar youth films that have inundated the market in recent times . it is hard to tell what is independent about this film ; it might as well have been made in hollywood or on a home videocam . it is the debut film for the director , who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy new jersey accents and remaining tight with each other as they grow into young adults , a tale which could have been rewarding to see in the 1950s , where the mind-set of all the characters depicted is grounded , but to see it in the 1990s is a different story : it is old news . the introduction of the wise-guy angle and the loyality among buddies bit , are not moving enough emotional experiences or intelligent enough dramatics to elevate this film above its limited story line despite the tour-de-force performance by the star of the film , adrien brody as ray . the title of this film refers to the shoe size of paul newman-10b , which really has nothing to do with explaining anything about the film . you should be aware that there are a lot of things about this film that don't make sense : its constant brainless chatter between the buddies , their uneventful growing pains , and the despair of their lives , make it very difficult to feel any empathy for them . there is nothing i have seen so far to like about ray . he is undependable , mean-spirited , and stupid . as for ray's gambling debt and his dilemma of how to pay it off , the story is too predictable for anything other than what you would expect to happen . there was just no energy or spark or anything relevant in this superficial film to keep it interesting , though adrien brody showed signs that he could be a future star . because of his intensity and looks , he reminds me of sean penn . "
45,"it is difficult to fall in love with a material thing like a violin , except when it is played as beautifully as it is by solo violinist joshua bell , as esa-pekka salonen conducts the london philharmonia orchestra , playing john corigliano's score . its ill-conceived plot is so sloppily directed and trite , that it was a very trying experience just to try and figure out what the director was trying to say about the violin that made him think that this story was so mysterious and worth telling . each century is a primer for relating the current society's love for classical music compared to the love shown for it by the violin's creator . all the vignettes involving the violin changing hands in different countries made me cringe with embarrassment , as the tales were so devoid of any logic and so ridden with cliches , as to make them unintentionally laughable . what could this team of writer and director have been thinking about ? it is hard to believe that this is the same team that made the very pertinent and inspiring "" thirty two short films about glenn gould . "" the scenes in shanghai during mao tse-tung's cultural revolution , in which western culture is demonized and its books and musical instruments are unceremoniously tossed into a bonfire , are flatly and uninspiringly done . vignette left no lasting impression on me , except as a further illustration of how the story got the costumes right but distorted the historical events . that the film has lost all track of itself in these tedious vignettes , so much so that it has no chance of ever uncovering what it probably wanted to show , of how the universal message of music brings harmony to the world and how it transcends all cultures and kinds of people . if that was all he did , it would have been enough and perhaps the film could have ended with some dignity , and the music presented would have left a big enough impression so that the film could at least be worth seeing for that . but no ! for some unfathomable reason , we are supposed to get worked up about a bidding war for the violin and who would possess this perfect instrument when for the entire film there was not one person in the movie covered in enough depth that we could get emotionally involved with , and to care at this late date about who owns this material object , when it has long since been viewed as a mere trophy , just doesn't make sense . that the one who does walk away with the trophy , confirms my feeling that every judgment the director and writer made about this film was a wrong one . what makes this film seem worse than the usual hollywood blockbuster , a film that it is most imitative of , is that it is presented as a high-brow art film and will draw its audience from those who see such films , but it is done so pretentiously , lacking in any kind of subtle mannerisms and humor , that all it has to offer story wise is its superficial dialogue and pretty costumes . its high production costs to attain accuracy of story only resulted in a film of kitsch art . if you see it , it should be only for the wonderful solo violin of joshua bell . "
46,"one thing becomes apparent , wenders has very little feel for comedy , all his efforts to evoke buster keaton type comedic skits fall flat . the film rambles pointlessly on-- and when he catches up with bauchau , these scenes of dialogue get pretentious , as if they were trying to say something heavy about images and the making of movies , but are really saying very little . the travelogue tour of lisbon , a city that is easy to look at because of its beautiful colors and tranquil streets , should come as no surprise , since this commercial film was sponsored by the city , as a way of boosting tourism . wenders contrasts the splendid structures of the old city with the more modern lisbon , not taking sides which one he likes better . the great portugese filmmaker manoel de oliveira makes a cameo to deliver a sermon on films , asking , "" what use is the universe ? "" a profound question for this lightweight travelogue to probe , as this conversation seems forced , not happening with the mood of the film ; nevertheless , some good ideas about the values of the older films are discussed here , the main point being that we need artists so that they can imitate god . i just didn't see much of a story in this somewhat diverting travelogue about lisbon , that would compel me to find this semi-documentary as anything but a mildly interesting travelogue . "
47,"for three quarters of the film , an exciting , somewhat plausible thriller takes place , that is even occasionally intriguing . then it comes apart and turns into routine hollywood , cop-out stuff . as a result , this film wastes splendid acting jobs by clint , ed , and scott . it is no mystery to the audience , because they saw exactly what happened . it is watchable hokum , with a hardly credible story , getting by solely on solid acting jobs from the leads . the script calls for no bold statements about the politics of the white house , which makes the film rather weak in scope and purpose . yet , the film is bearable , fortunate to be in the hands of someone as deft as clint ; or else , with a lesser director , it could have certainly sunk to an abysmally lower level , though one wouldn't be far wrong thinking it has already sunk to that level . "
48,"this well-conceived but ultra sugary coming-of-age film is not for everyone , and i include myself as one of those who found it too sappy for my digestion . loggia is wonderful in relating to the child in such a wholesome manner , it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup . the beals are like a sitcom idyllic family , where everyone is just so nice and affluent , and properly religious without being fanatical . all this mawkish interplay makes it almost too nauseating to watch . his answer is to search for god , pretty heady stuff for a youngster his age to do , but that's just the way it is , sometimes . now , that's a smart kid . maybe that's for another film down the road . this part of the film was the final straw for me , i couldn't swallow any more goo . as this film flopped commercially , his next one , the sixth sense , pared down the schmaltz and came up smelling like a rose . though if you look through the cleverness of both scripts , this director is loaded with hokum , all he has learned how to do , is hide the hokum better . this is a nice family picture and there is room for it in hollywood . it's just too bad that it had nothing relevent or even truthful to say about death , children in a parochial elementary school , or for that matter , about god . and that family of his , they're too good for words . yet the film meant well and its benign message had its heart in the right place . for those who want to see something soft , without a bite to it , this is the one . "
49,"celebrity is like an amalgam of old woody allen materials , which has always given him an opening to concentrate on being witty and ignoring such filmmaking details as editing and plot . this fluff film ( no pretense at ingmar bergman depths here ) could have been funny but it isn't , except in brief spots . as far as being insightful about the "" horses arses "" who are into being celebrities without any other accomplishments to their credit , there's not really too much to be said that could be profound about that subject matter , it is obvious how shallow a fate just being a celebrity is . woody makes a stronger statement in the film's subplot that deals with love , as he believes that meeting the right mate is mostly a matter of luck . here kenneth branagh is not woody allen , but he plays woody and it doesn't work out that well . he's just not funny , all he's got down pat are woody's voice inflections and neurotic gestures . it's as if he is a robot who looks the part but can't really be the part because he is isn't humanly programed that way . if woody played that scene , it most probably would have been funny , but with branaugh , it seemed pathetically flat and unfunny . donald trump is buying st . patrick's cathedral and tearing-it-down for a skyscraper . celebrities give trite comments to banal questions , such as , "" what do you think of the rain ? "" "" it's really something ! "" the beautifully shot b/w film ends as it begins , as a plane passes overhead with the skywriting word "" help ! "" this was a film that had no idea how to put this story together , it seemed so lifeless and flat , indeed , in need of help . for starters , none of the main characters were cast right , and especially branaugh : there's no way , no matter how exact his mimicry of woody is , that he can be thought of as a neurotic , nebbish , nyc jew . what was needed was some originality and some energy into making the characters appear absurdly funny and not carbon copy imitations of how celebrities are . the few jokes in the film were far and few between , and could not overcome the tired feeling emanating from the rambling story . woody is slipping , his last few films have been heading on a steady downward path . "
50,"joseph ruben ( sleeping with the enemy/the stepfather/gorp/the good son ) has directed a lot of films that are just plain awful , as you could see from those mentioned above , except for the adequately made swte . he directed this predictable drama with a heavy hand as it lapses into melodramatics after a very emotionally moving start and after presenting a most interesting premise ; it is just too bad that the script had no conviction to follow through on its premise . the weakness of the film can be found in the director's lack of courage in understanding what a decision like this really entails to the person involved , and by making the film all about the anne heche character instead of focusing mainly on the two boys , as the film loses its sense of direction . by adding sidebars to the simple premise , it changes the question considerably and takes the edge off what decision is made . the director spoon feeds the answer that he thinks the audience wants , and it all seems to be a predictable formula driven film instead of one filled with a raw energy . after mid-film , any logical attempt at soul searching for what to do was lost in a series of obvious contrivances and clich ? s that were displeasing to watch . bad directors do such things to good ideas . heche is intense and persistent , not letting up on the less than eager sheriff to make such a commitment . here the story gets side-tracked for bad reasons . the only scene that made sense from this point on in the story , was the one where tony's fianc ? e ( vera ) asks some intelligent questions of the lawyer and fails to illicit responses that would make me want to go back . who in their right mind would unquestionably believe what beth is saying ? that is too easy a reason . heroes usually don't know if they are going to be heroes , they just do what is right at the moment . it is instinctual . in this case , from what i have seen of beth's direct confrontational approach , as difficult as it might be to say no , i think most people in tony's shoes would have no choice but refuse her request . at least , it does for tony . the scene of lewis in the malaysian jail , which is actually a jail cell in the philadelphia prison system , of him rambling on incoherently , complaining about the cell being godless , i thought , more than being good acting , smacked of melodrama and was not a very convincing portrayal of someone going over the edge ; but , it was scary . i just wonder how many would honestly go back to save lewis if they were in tony's shoes or in sheriff's shoes . i also wonder how good this film could have been in the hands of a fritz lang or even an elia kazan , or a modern director such as a martin scorsese . and that is the shame of this somber picture , it failed to move me and seemed to turn into a slight story , and this is after all its contrivances .

51,"passion ( director/writer : jean-luc godard ; cinematographer : raoul coutard ; cast : isabelle huppert ( isabelle ) , hanna schygulla ( hanna ) , michel piccoli ( michel ) , jerzy radziwilowicz ( jerzy ) , 1982-fr . ) i have never warmed up to godard films ; i always found them pretentious and only mildly diverting . i have not seen a film of his since the '70s that i particularly cared for . so i looked at passion , a film about his love of politics , art , and filmmaking with a slightly jaundiced eye , and i was not disappointed . i still don't like his style , or his rejection of a linear story for a rambling dialogue that misses more often than it hits the mark . what i thought he did exceedingly well in this work , was have the cinematography for the film within a film , enhance in a very elegant manner the film's costumed and mannered scenes , allowing them to shine as colorful spectacles , and by making good use of the actual paintings by incorporating them into the film , using such artist's works as , el greco , rembrandt , rubens , delacroix , and ingres . the story in a nutshell is about a polish director trying to make a film on a shoestring budget , while courting the elusive isabelle huppert and the plain-spoken hannah schygulla , and fighting with the producers who want the film to have a logical story . godard has made a film about searching for something to love by showing that love is something that is essential to keep you in balance amid the chaos of one's life and the outside turmoils of war and class struggle . hannah says , in a moment of deep reflection , "" sometimes i love what i don't like . "" ummm ! an intriguing and provocative thought by godard , though i am not exactly sure what he means . but it is thoughts like this , that make me keep coming back to see godard films . for me , there is only one basic rule for the cinema , make an intellectually sound , honestly done and lucid film . i think i'm on a collision course with messier godard , though his ideas on making a film , such as passion , and my ideas , will sometimes result in only near collisions . i admittedly find some of his premises provoking , which is why this film , has enough intellectual stimulation in it for me not to loathe it , just to feel unsatisfied by all its unfulfilled promise . "
52,"a second-rate , watchable noir film , distinguished by its gritty authentic nyc location shots and the lack of acting ability exhibited by this largely unknown cast and the low-level crime committed , where the detective jokes that this crime didn't even make it into "" the daily news . "" he doesn't seem like he is an actor or a cop , but he does appear as if he is a genuinely nice person , which in the long run might prove better for humanity , but it doesn't help this film , a film that could have used something more from him to spark this ordinary tv-like crime drama . why he goes on this rampage is never made clear , except it is surmised that he might be the jealous type . spotted by our hero , he shoots it out with him unsuccessfully among the many gravestones , which makes for a colorful scene , the best and most memorable one of the film . "
53,"a screwball comedy that is conceptually funny but the more ridiculous it gets as the story picks up its pace the less funny it seems . it never has an edge to it , therefore it seems more like a sitcom than a comedy/drama . drama and characterization are thrown out the window , and contrivances rule the day . . . which allow the home fries to become too tasteless to enjoy . but the film just can't get above the absurdity of its bizarre tale to say much more about why everyone is so screwed up or make the romance between the shy dorian ( the good brother ) and sally feel like it belongs in the film . these two are not believable as lovers , as i saw no sparks flying from them . also the murder plot is just not that funny , and when it becomes more involved , it just becomes a sick joke that goes on for too long ; and , the film ends with a one-too many helicopter scene that couldn't be more ridiculous . the film had all the hints of going somewhere in its opening premise , but it seemed to get stuck , not knowing how to tell a story about what the film really should have been about , the quest of dorian and sally for a normal life despite their dysfunctional up-bringing . being a weirdo does not make one necessarily an interesting character . that is a lesson that this first-time director should take away from this failed effort at dark humor . it should be mentioned that there was one appetizing scene in the movie , as dorian escorts sally to lamaze class and we see them go through those exercises ; it is still a good scene even if it is still not clear why he does so . i just had the feeling he felt sorry for her , rather than that he was in love with her , as i presume the director wanted us to believe . this is a film that might please those who frequent fast-food places and don't worry about their cholestral count and indigestion . in other words , the film moved along at a fast pace , there wasn't much to think about , and might be just the thing for those who would consider this a date movie and not be concerned that it didn't deliver a heavier meal . as for me , i try to eat junk food only when i'm stuck on the road and am starving to death . in this case , since i wasn't stuck on the road , my excuse for eating this junk food was that i was enticed to try something new they were advertising on the menu , but after tasting it , i felt it was just like the same old stuff they always serve in those places , and i just wasn't hungry enough to appreciate that .

54,"obviously there is no such a place as pleasantville , except in a sitcom . pleasantville is a film about how selective one's memory is when it comes to nostalgia , of pining for values that never existed back then but still are the values exemplified for the traditional family , of the resistance to change , and clashes between those in the film who become "" colored "" and those who remain in "" black-and-white , "" and about the need to be an individual and not conform . it's fairly predictable what will happen once the two realize that they are transformed into an unreal tv world , as the film prepares to go into its satire mold and take apart the blandness of such perfection . the filmmaker then analyzes these changes on those newly affected and the result is a more troubled but more interesting people emerging . through special effects from digital processing , flowers start taking on color and the film begins to have a modern-day "" alice in wonderland "" look to it . j . t . there was something that rubbed me the wrong way about this "" cute "" idea of a film , besides the fact it was boring and i felt as if i was being lectured to about the obvious general ills of society . there are no radical new ideas presented in this film that will make me really think about these issues any differently than the films of the 1950s would have ; it is as if the filmmaker is saying that 1950s didn't have films that were critical of society : but a list of such films would be very extensive ( marty , high noon , ace in the hole , etc . ) . this snooty attitude , looking down at the past from the vantage point of a supposedly "" hip "" new age bothered me . afterall , my impression of this film , is that it really is a 1950s sitcom merging with a 1990s "" feel good "" type of sitcom , and nothing more . it is basically , a gimmicky film , which is the only new ground it breaks , selling an idea about the past that connects it with the present , but doing it at the expense of telling the truth about neither the past or present . the film is trying to say that the innocence of the 1950s must be merged with the social awareness of the 1990s and this can only be accomplished by the teenage heroes , who are not afraid to take chances and change the times they're in . i just didn't buy into this premise and was not convinced that i wasn't seeing anything but a superficial film . character development is a raising of consciousness that comes about only through a real inward awareness , a book can only act as a catalyst for that experience . what is offered movie-wise , is just the kind of empty gestures made to genuine problems , which can be found on tv programs from both yesterday and today . therefore it is just another empty gesture at culture , trying to be cute , letting the baby boomers know that it's okay , there're doing just fine . you can keep being materialists , just be cool about it ! there was no one in this film who understood how to bridge the past with the future , instead this becomes a film just like the sitcoms it parodies , which means it's just another escape film , unable or unwilling to delve deeply into all the real problems it brings up . "
55,"this very predictable social drama will have every character be a walking clich ? , every major event be a contrived one , and it will do everything it could do to convince the audience that assimilation is the way to go , but get out on the pulpit and preach against racial hatred . it is good to have such tolerant beliefs , don't get me wrong , but to make such a boring and muddled picture about it , is not a good thing . the film's themes about religious fanatics , family problems , prostitution , hypocrisy , jealousy over a friend's success , the immigration problem , bigotry , the problems a young man has in growing up , a father-son frictional relationship , social hierarchy , male abuse towards women , the tribulations of a workaholic , love , loneliness , the need for warmth , and cultural clashes , are just too many themes for one film to have . the filmmaker is all over the cricket field with these problems , but just can't make this long list of problems have any lasting interest for the film goer . and , as if these weren't enough problems , some more come up when the taxi driver takes as his fare , a german industrialist , stellan skarsg ? rd , who goes by the name of schitz ( you can see for yourself what goes for humor here , as you try to pronounce that name ) . when it comes down to the nitty-gritty of things , this uncompelling film can't make up its mind on how it stands on some of the major issues it brings to the table . by the film's end i don't know how to feel about parvez's romance with the prostitute , as it certainly breaks up his family life but gives him a temporary renewed self-respect and hope . for me , it was just an unbelievable scene , and to boot , it didn't clear up anything about the mainstream moslem official position on the negativity toward prostitution . in fact , i didn't learn anything about moslems except to see them as the stereotypes they are most of the time depicted as in most other mainstream films . om puri ( in custody/city of joy/target ) is an accomplished actor from india , whose trademark face and ability to be very expressive and exuberant , engages the film with his sense of what it is to be a decent person . there is something about him that identifies with those who are outsiders , as long as they are not fanatics or troublemakers . but the filmmaker doesn't even attempt to play fair , the story is told totally from his point of view , all the others around him are one-dimensional characters , who are not only uninteresting but they are for the most part made to appear annoying . that parvez is a decent guy , with a good attitude , is probably not as true as the filmmaker thinks . that this film doesn't have the power to say anything important that hasn't been heard many times before , is my take on it . but the worst thing about this film , is that it is a snoozer , not able to make its story about the virtues of being faithful to your culture and your wife come to life , as it is mired down in one clich ? after another . the best thing to say about this art- house type of film , is that it should upset no one : it is so bland and unexciting that it is hard to tell what all the fuss is about . there was just nothing here to get worked up about . i just assume people immigrate to western countries to earn a better living , there is no big deal in exposing that . but , you can be sure of one thing , this moslem filmmaker did not pull a salman rushdie with this film . "
56,"by the title of the film , you know that betrayal is part of the storyline ; and , it is , in this hip attempt at neo-noir and a quentin tarantino type of film , using the colorful city of new orleans as background for its murder and kidnapping tale . as a nervous accountant from dyson's firm , the one who will hand over the ransom money to the kidnapers goes through the phone drill of where to drop the money off , the cops follow along and have some forced conversations on the way to stir up some humor in this poorly characterized and acted script , that will rely on trick plots and a series of betrayals to tell its very forgetable story . one of the cop conversations mimics many of the more recent neo-noir genre films in slickness , as hawkins is reading jim thompson's crime novel "" the killer inside me , "" which he has already read and greatly admires , with the main thrust from that conversation being that the book says there is only one plot in a murder mystery and that nothing is what it seems . there was nothing fresh about the plot . the characters ranged from being obnoxious to being miscast , though if one wished to , a case could be made that carla gugino exuded some charm and sex appeal into the film . there was some inventiveness in all the plot twists , but the effort wasn't worth it . the storyline and plot twists could not hold up to scrutiny , anyway . somehow this film , for the first time director , managed to have some entertainment value in its glossy feel and arduous attempt to keep one guessing at what will happen next , that is , if you weren't turned off by then by how hip it tried to be , as it was a little too cool for its own good , and the story suffered because there was no meaning to what was happening : it all seemed like a pointless exercise . "
57,"it worked reasonably well for part of the film , as dead bodies came popping up unexpectedly in this sleepy montana town , but then the story ran out of tricks and everything about the film fell apart and the psychopathic woman hating slasher , lester long ( vaughn ) , became a tiresome charge , his maniacal charm just wore out his welcome on screen , and the film's conclusion lacked tension or purpose and seemed to be a wasted effort , as it just simply ran out of gas after about an hour into it . what garofalo brought to the film at this point , was some welcomed comic relief , much needed because this film was exhausted from all the contrivances and lack of adequate character study it provided . it was only through garofolo's sense of black comedy , that the film was still bearable ; and , at that , it was only barely bearable . clay is somewhat of an innocent , at least , as far as the murders go , but he certainly can't be commended for being a truthful person . everything gets resolved in the film's anticlimax , that mercifully ends in an arrest , though some 30 minutes too late , as far as i'm concerned . what might be likable about this film , to viewers not that discerning about plot or character study , is that this film was user friendly and brought about a hearty guffaw or two . none of the actors was bad , bad , but none were memorable . it's one of those films that is easily forgotten . "
58,"larry buchanan has created this cheapie aip color film that has a great title , a dismal story and hammy acting worthy of an amateur thespian production . it's the kind of film played out in a serious manner , that you couldn't help either enjoying or hating it for its awkwardness and how bad it was . my caveat is : if you don't take this film seriously , you are more than likely to have a better reaction to it than those who do . the martians observe that ties are worn here , something they discarded in mars 50-years ago as something useless . that's about as deep a jab at political satire this film takes . love is something that has gone out of vogue in mars for the last 100- years , but our hero says , this is what it must feel like . she never realized he was a martian , which shows you that even experts on mars could be fooled . what goes for special effects , are scenes where women are disappearing and aliens are appearing out of thin air . if you are in the mood for something to see that is inane , a film that edward wood jr . would be proud of , but in the hands of an edgar ullmer , could have been much more notable , then this one could hit your funny bone . in any case , i was in a silly mood when i saw it and was not disappointed , it was as bad as i thought it would be ; and , i thoroughly enjoyed it . "
59,"much ado is made about aspidistra in this comedy adapted from the semi-autobiographical novel of george orwell . there's a point to be made in this 1930s depression satire about money counting for everything , and this point is hammered into every aspect of the story , until it gets to be not only redundant , but outright irritating to hear . the story quickly makes its point , as valid as it might be in orwell's novel , here it seems trivial , that people delude themselves into thinking that they are the next shakespeare and spend a miserable time living in poverty or doing what they shouldn't be doing , when they would be much happier being accepted into the middle-class where they duly belong . it's a fair enough point made , but the story has this nasty habit of being saccharine to a point , where its sugary qualities could be fatal to the viewer's heart . even the scenes of poverty are sugar-coated , making everything look so awfully nice . something gordon can't do . it also , somehow , stretches the point of art and advertisement having much in common , cynically stating there is little difference between how they achieve their ends . the message i got , as i watched this tepid middle-brow , so-called art film , is that living in poverty can be stifling , and that kind of life is not what makes an artist . for a movie railing against accepting bourgeoisie values - it instead becomes a movie that ends up glorifying those values . its final message is that there is no escape from one's destiny . if one looked hard enough , there can be found some wit in gordon's portrayal of a likable jerk with artistic ambitions and some charm in his relationship with rosemary . but this uninspired script cannot find anything relevant to say to make this satire meaningful . you'll get a better feel of what orwell was trying to satirize reading that book than you will by seeing this film . "
60,"this is an excellent example of a classic bad movie coming out of the '50s sci-fi genre , one that is funny without intending to be funny . this little subplot never gets resolved , but adds to the confusion of the story . the story was so confusing , that the film could have been seen in any of the following ways : as a typical teen dating flick , a sci-fi movie , or a comedy spoof of the horror genre . cahn raises no serious questions about anything- he seems to have a money and brain outage when he made this one . he could have certainly used a much tighter script , better actors , and had more imagination . somehow , i got a few laughs out of this flick , and that's good enough for a film that can never go out of style because it is so bad that it never was in style in the first place . . . this film was originally released on a double bill with "" i was a teenage werewolf . "" "
61,"edward l . cahn's four skulls is a rather humorless and flat horror story , but it's blessed with a wonderful title . you would think her old man would tell her about something as important as that . challenging idea was never really followed through , as the film instead became a conventional melodrama . but in the hands of someone more intellectually capable than cahn , there was the thread of a good story available , instead of shooting for the mundane , the reliance on the creepiness of the killer and the spectacle of seeing a head shrunk to tell the story . it is what gives one immortality . don't ask me what this means symbolically ! it's too bad this film didn't have some more life to it . the best thing that can be said about it , is that it was competently made and was somehow watchable . the actors are to be commiserated with and not criticized , no actor could have done anything with the dry lines they were handed . it was never mentioned if they were twins or not . "
62,"there is a level of flatness to the film , as it is not aided by its feeble dialogue and uninteresting special effects , its incredulous tale , and unexciting tone . but all seems gloomy , because if they can't be stopped here , they will surely go on and attack the mainland . this was just not a good sci-fi film , but i've seen worse , much worse , and somehow or other , this hammer film was watchable , but barely so . this film should be liked most by fans of either christopher lee or peter cushing , who will most likely appreciate lee's stylized performance . "
63,"lies become the theme of the film , as it is examined how harmless or necessary they are for people , especially since most people live hum-drum lives and could use a little imagination to liven things up . people also lie because they feel hurt about things and think that by lying they can make themselves feel better . the spanish director , bigas luna ( jamon , jamon/golden balls/the tit and the moon ) , known to make very unconventional and sexually implicit films , has apparently toned down his act here , shooting for satire as his only proverbial fish in the barrel to shoot at . not only did i find this film a bore , the acting uninspiring , and the motif unconvincing , but what annoyed me most , was that there was scene after scene of horty telling his inane story of his dying love for marie , to an audience that pays to hear this so they can have a good cry over it . it seemed to be pushing in the audience face what the director was supposedly satirizing . the film is a parody of a need people have to hear great stories , whether they are true or not , which might be a good idea on which to anchor a film , but this one had no heart-beat to it . the melodramatic soapy romantic story , just never sailed gracefully across the ocean . the film was never able to be poetic or articulate about the point it was trying to make , instead it just settled for looking good , but couldn't rejuvenate through this feeble storytelling ploy , the art of good storytelling . there was just no passion to be found in all these handsome stars ; the idea of the film , that one can't live without imagination in one's life , was a worthy idea that never fully materialized . it has the look of one of those arty-farty films , the ones that only play in art houses and pretend to be something more arty than what they are . "
64,"story is predictable , likable , and soapy . it leaves one all fuzzy and cuddly inside , as the film uses risque material to make its point , yet it is almost totally devoid of hot sex . it traps you in its formula mode ; you can't help wishing these blokes do well . the film's popularity does not surprise me , people seem to like quick solutions to their problems and films where thinking is not a prerequisite for enjoying it . i have a feeling that this film will age poorly , and like a lot of trendy films , will not look good a few years from now . i thought it offered just so-so entertainment value . it never gave me the impression that i was seeing something that mattered . the full monty as promised , was not even delivered . "
65,"cost of living is a modern noir film that does not use the familiar plot devices of that genre as it usually is used , instead devoting the entire film to studying one character and her reactions to being on the run . it is the type of role usually played by a man . the film might be about trying to find oneself , or about why you are going to a fishing village if you're not interested in fishing . the most profound line said by anyone in the film is said by edie falco : "" things are not always what they seem- ben ! "" the dialogue is muted . the film yearns to be a story about how impossible it is to be free in today's world and how everything one does hurts . it's different in mood and scope than the usual type of introspective film . the film hinges on falco's performance . i didn't buy it , so i failed to find the film engrossing . she seemed to be acting too hard to look as if she was loose and free . at the end of the film , we don't know too much more about her than we did at the beginning of the film . if you are looking for possible plusses in this hip neo-noir film , it might be in the director's visualizations . at least , this indie is original and is not the usual rip off you see of late . it should also be noted that i had trouble reading the opening credits . they were unclear on the video i watched . but what remained more unclear to me , was what this film was about . it was not a paricularly pleasant film to watch , and the violence in it , seemed misplaced . i had no feel for those in the film , therefore seeing the violence was much like reading a newspaper account of a tragedy occurring to strangers . "
66,"it's a one joke movie that quickly runs out of steam , as the cloying humor soon becomes insipid and the comic situation turns out to be more ridiculous than funny . it's a star vehicle effort , so if you like de niro and crystal , then you have a chance of falling for the film's silly premise and not caring how inane the dialogue is . the shrink is absolutely frightened of vitti and wants no part of it , which is a source for much of the film's early humor . >from here on the story has no place to go but downhill , the jokes quickly fade , and the pacing of the film drags . the film is loaded with sight gags , clashes of culture between the educated jewish doctor and the tough-guy italians . there are many mafia type of jokes , stereotypes of italian gangsters , and many other routines about the mob that have been seen in a host of other mob films . the scene wasn't funny , believable , or watchable . i don't think the director knew how to end this satire with any credibility . the film just ran out of one-liners and ways to be irreverent to the mob , the f . b . i . , and the psychoanalysts . the jokes might even seem funnier late at night . the film just wasn't involving enough to work as drama , but if it's a few laughs that you are after , then this film delivers . de niro has a good eye for parody and is the best thing about the film . crystal seems to be miscast . viterelli and kudrow add light touches of comedy in their supporting roles . the funniest bit , i thought , was of de niro crying over a television commercial , thinking it was so much like his real-life situation . "
67,"the trouble with carlyle's part ( not his performance ) was that it had no punch to it , he couldn't make it an interesting role . the stories he told about the english bringing fleas and the damp to ireland , didn't evoke the comedy or sympathy for him that it should have . the whole point of the film will be a long and trying study in misery and poverty , as the family will undergo a series of hardships , including the loss of three young children . the film never gets untracked from its maudlin attitude . it suffers from the old problem of trying to portray misery without having a film that can escape from being miserable itself . the other problem is that the misery seemed unreal , everything about it seemed so uninvolving and pristine . the film was flat . it was hard to care about what was happening to them , except the obvious reaction one gets when seeing a poor household . their endless plight seemed no different from the beginning of the film to the end . it was the filmmakers job , the director alan parker , along with the screenwriter , laura jones , to make me want to care , but instead , they made me feel too distant to honestly feel anything . and if misery per se were an interesting topic , this adaptation of frank mccourt's book might be too . to make matters even worse , this is an excrutiatingly long film , over two-and-a-half-hour running time , and it seemed to go on forever . this almost solemn film portrayal , with an irish brogue voiceover throughout its entirety , explaining every little piece of misery as if were a work of sublime art , did not work for me . the film has a bored look about it , indicating nothing much is going to happen except for a string of gross events and that frank , as a survivor , will somehow come through all this misery . it almost seems to be a shame not to connect with the family's plight , but as well-intentioned as this film was and as good as the pulitzer prize winning autobiography was supposed to be ( i didn't read it ) , it was , nevertheless , made into a conventional film with nothing in it to really rave about . most life stories do not make for good dramatics in films anyway , they seem better suited for the printed page . this one is no exception . "
68,"it is turturro's love message to the theater . this play-within-a-film , much like bullets over broadway or shakespeare in love , but not up to both of those film's achievements , nevertheless it manages to develop a somewhat pleasing storyline and some amusing comic moments . it is flawed by its uneven drama and how easy it is to lose track of what is going on because of all the characters the story tries to portray . the second memorable performer is umberto bevalaqua ( walken ) , the detested theater critic , who plays the part of a fop , excessively showing his outrageous mannerisms . the scene works as farce , and it gives the story some needed life . when walken is onscreen the film has movement and excitement , when he's not , the film just doesn't hold up as well . life in the theater gets juxtaposed within the film ; its story going back and forth with contrasting details , such as the latest gossip or romance , the vanity of the players , and the strange love they have for the theater . their romance outside the play mirrors their romance in the film , and one can therefore imply that it mirrors their real life romance . she easily handles this charming but not too difficult role . aida turturro , the real-life cousin of the director , plays a part that makes good use of her huge breasts . the play and the film was overloaded with a flavor of italian , it only seemed odd that the film was staged in new york and not in milan . i can't see a general audience taking to this strictly for the theater crowd film ; it is made mostly for those who love to know what goes on behind the scenes and those who are theater buffs . i applaud the effort and the originality of the film ; but , as for what resulted , i was not overjoyed with this overstuffed production . "
69,"the best part of the film , is that it did capture the east village feel of the reagan 1980s . but , for the most part , this was a dull film that had nothing to say and soon wore out its welcome as the story became insipid and the characters grating . in the end , the film proved to be as shallow as the characters were . director risa bramon garcia , making her debut after a successful career as a casting director , seems to be more interested in getting the pop music of the 1980s heard and the bizarre dress of party goers viewed , than in telling a cohesive story . in this ensemble piece , there are far too many characters to really get to know them and too many sub plot developments to keep your interest . everyone fades in and out of the scene , for no rhyme or reason , each with some tale to tell . "" if you relax , you can get what you want , even if you smell like dog shit . "" the film is almost bearable when it just goes for the look and feel of the times , but when it tries to pontificate , such as when it sums up the film by comparing relationships to the way smokers have a need for cigarettes , and asks the question from the pair that got the most screen time , rudd and love , "" why are people so scared of each other ? then i felt the party was really over and this mtv produced story faded out with not one interesting character in the film . i bet you a dollar to a donut , that you could have gone to most any other new year's eve party in manhattan and met more interesting people ! "
70,"john frankenheimer was once recognized as a quality filmmaker capable of making great paranoid thrillers ( the manchurian candidate ) , who has slipped off the precipice of reliability and is now reduced to making this nonsensical , exploitive actioner , that has a bleak metallic snowy look to it . it is made as if to bypass movie houses and go straight to video rentals . it is made from a mindless script . no director , cinematographer , or actor could have made this into a credible film ( well ! replacing affleck as the lead couldn't have hurt in immediately improving it . the film's only purpose seems to be to come up with as many ludicrous plot twists as possible and see if any one in the audience can guess how it will work itself out . the violence is gratuitous and in the last 20 minutes or so , the story proves itself to be an insulting one . the characters became gradually less and less human as the twists kept piling up . the shame of this film , is that it was oddly enough entertaining for long stretches , as it seemed to pass for being a diverting actioner , until it reached the point of no return in tolerability . to say that this film had holes in the script and that everything about the story could be challenged , goes without saying . but things only get more contrived the further along the story moves , so better to forget all the contrivances to the story and try to enjoy the film as is , and take this b- film for what it is . this little ploy will go on for the remainder of the film , as rudy is sometimes nick and sometimes he's just plain rudy . if you think you have seen the main twists , let me warn you , that's just the beginning of all the surprises . the more of them there are , the less sense the film seems to make . john frankenheimer moves the action along at breakneck speed but the more the characters try explaining the ever-changing situations , the more ridiculous the explanations become . then the film tries to pull a complete 360 degree reversal and end on a note of christmas cheer , since i think this is supposed to be some kind of christmas story . what disturbed me more than anything else about the film , which includes its senseless violence and its need for an obligatory nude shot of theron , was the audacity to try and clean up the mess it made , by relating the film's finale to the holiday spirit of giving . it seems to want to spread its desperate gloom over everything it can touch . the thing this film mostly gave me , was a sense of astonishment that frankenheimer , who could still in flashes shoot a scene that is mesmerizing ( the one on the cracked ice with affleck jumping into the chilly water to save theron ) and then follow it up with one that is so dopey ( machine-gunning warfare in a casino that looks like a supermarket ) , that you wonder what happened to the director in a career that spanned 44- years . what compelled him to make such a dumb film as this one ! "
71,"the mild attempt , in this b- film , to be a convincing noir film , never materializes , as the film looks more like a sophomoric attempt to imitate the genre than the real thing . there is no feeling for characters or intensity in this story , it looks contrived from the get-go . all the characters , except for reese's , are slime balls , people we could care less about . so when this film moves into its different plot twists and all kinds of ludicrous situations develop , it wanes in interest , as the characters were never developed and the film has a cheesy look to it . it seems to have the style of a thriller but without the substance . its attempt at humor alluded me . "
72,"a superficial b- movie about flying saucers , offering no relevant views on matters of space exploration , except some might be amused to see washington d . c . come under attack by flying saucers . using ray harryhausen's flying saucers , this film becomes mostly a special effect experience . it is a good example of the kind of mediocre , paranoiac sci-fi films that were being made at the time . though , the exception to this uninteresting sci-fi film at the time , might be the one adapted from robert heinlein's novel "" rocketship galileo , "" which was made as "" destination moon ( 50 ) . "" but it wasn't until kubrick came along in the 1960s with his "" 2001 : a space odyssey "" that sci-fi films matured into solid ventures and started to be taken seriously . the silliness of the film is delightfully highlighted by the finale of the flying saucer attack on washington dc . its use was argued against , by major huglin , that it would only destroy our country and might not even work against the aliens . the film becomes a classic in sci-fi for its special effects , despite how mundane everything else about this project is . "
73,"a somewhat tolerable golem b- movie thanks to fast-paced direction and a compact script . recommended for only die-hard fans of edward l . cahn . it is a remake of "" the mummy ( 32 ) "" and was on a double bill with the same director's better made film , "" it ! we are told that there were some mysteries from those days that still remain today . flash back to modern times and a workman on an archeological dig unearths a jewel box and the mummified body of a faceless man . meanwhile the bronze medallion found in the jewel box is examined along with its inscription : "" whoever stands between me and what's mine shall perish . i am the son of the etruscan gods , quintillus . "" if you buy this explanation , maybe i can interest you in some swampland in florida ! i bet you this jaded policeman thought he saw everything ! this is enough to make that swell derby he wears , spin around atop his puzzled head . if you don't believe that is the ending , see the ending for yourself . the filmmaker plays it straight , but if you are in the mood for some balderdash , i am sure there are some laughs to be gotten .

74,"swindle , the ( rien ne va plus ) ( director/writer : claude chabrol ; cinematographer : eduardo serra ; editor : monique fardoulis ; cast : isabelle huppert ( betty ) , michel serrault ( victor ) , francois cluzet ( maurice ) , jean-francois balmer ( monsieur k ) , jackie berroyer ( chatillon ) , 1997-france ) this is one of chabrol's poorer films , the fiftieth one for the 68-year-old french director . it has the look and script of a b-film ( even though it was written expressly for the two stars ) . chabrol is playful here , but his lifetime of running gags against the bourgeoisie and his attempt to make this a giddy film , just didn't hold up . but it was never clearly spelled out what their intimate relationship was , as chabrol likes to keep one guessing . it wouldn't surprise me if they were related that way . maurice is scheduled to bring the money to guadeloupe to be exchanged , and chabrol adroitly uses all his many years of filmmaking skills to show double-crosses and switches of bags , and how things can go violently wrong with even the best of schemes . but , it is mostly a story about the two characters , their needs and how they relate to each other . that forms most of the wry comedy . there is also interest as to how and if the swindle can be pulled off by the couple , who , at times , have not told the other what they are up to . this caper story seemed stale to me , even though it has a certain amount of charm . but it did not splash across the screen with verve and audacity as much as chabrol intended it to . the director seemed to try too hard to relive his past with many allusions to characters and inside jokes from his many films , with the old master pulling out his tricks of the trade from a hat with too much ease to be believable . "
75,"costa-gavras ( z/missing ) presents a film about the media exploiting the news and expects us to be surprised to find out that all they care about is the ratings . the big carnival did this theme better , as long ago as 1951 . the film is one-dimensional in scope , no one has room to grow . the amusing relationship between travolta and dustin captures our attention for most of the film , but nothing interesting happens . the world of the media is shown to be worse than ever , as this new breed of executives are not really news people . the actors tried too hard to make something out of nothing . in the end , it is an old news story that we got-- but this time it is manipulated by the movie director instead of the anchor man and the new corporate executives . "
76,"the nightmarish scenes seem surpassed by cinematography techniques , allowing the story to move into the realm of make believe hollywood hokum rather than relying on the viewer's imagination to do the job . the irish-born director , jordan , whose accomplishments include a few first-class films among some disappointments , only proves here , that the horror thriller , perhaps , is not what he is best suited for . his heavy-handed direction , helped only in spoiling a fine cast from doing what it is capable of . jordan's idea of a horror thriller , seems to be in letting the heroine to act in a shrill voice , rather than letting the heroine's nightmare and mental breakdown come down as something internally real . if jordan went down the poetic trail instead of opting for this gobbledy-gook he comes up with , then we might have had a solid film to comment on . it was the only scene in the movie that was able to convey how believable her panic attacks really are . i think he's delusional if he thinks he got a real part in this film . his role is so insignificant , even more so than aidan quinn's , as to make stephen rea , seem less like a star than one of the film's extras . here , he is playing the role of vivian thompson , by making his villain role as campy as he could , managing to give the impression that he is a totally evil pervert , possibly even gay . downey jr . basically brought a sense of the ridiculous to this role , allowing the film to sink lower than than the ordinary hollywood horror film usually does . the film's intellectual theme , if i can loosely use the word intellectual , is a reversal of "" snow white "" , as this time the story is not narrated from the child's point of view , but from the mother's . an adult freudian tale , i suppose . the film just becomes a mess and the acting is constantly shrill . it is a film that can't be saved by good looking photography , or diffuse symbolism , or even by great special effects , but must be viewed wallowing in its own unpleasant reservoir of putrid storytelling . "
77,"unfortunately , in this ridiculous remake , the two films are only the same in name only ; though , in the broad sense they are both about a three thousand year egyptian curse . this mummy put me into a petulant adolescent mind-set , as i found myself madly screaming for more script , more story , more tomes , after seeing this stinker and found that i could only calm my rage by going to the video tape of the original mummy and seeing again for myself how richly quaint that film actually was . this is a film that lives for the clich ? , even relishes in it , flaunting it as the reason the film was made in the first place . it is so much like those thrashy "" b "" films in the early 1950s i saw on a saturday matinee , where the theater was so noisy the elderly matrons who were the ushers looked like they were having conniptions , as they marched down the aisles with their flashlights shining on the children with loudmouths . those were the "" good old days , "" when you got to see two pictures like this for the price of one , and didn't give a hoot how raucous the theater crowd was , and how dumb and unbelievable the hero was . this film is a return to that dumbness , only this time its appeal is targeted for a more mature crowd and the price of the movie ticket has skyrocketed . this is a children's serial adventure thriller , the indiana jones kind but without that film's charismatic actors . so wouldn't you know it , his tomb is opened inadvertently by some ugly american tourists . rick is one cool guy , with a self-deprecating sense of humor , with an unflappable personality , and with one eye for beauty and the other for battle : in other words , a man's man . the heroine tells us that this lackey is so wormy a character that he will surely get his come-uppance by the time the film ends . other so-called delights in this special effect and overlong film , are the gibberish messages read from the holy books , the one-liners coming off the lips of the characters faster than the bullets from their blazing guns , and all the free-spirited action scenes , that are non-stop , giving the film a lighter than lighthearted look to it . excuse me , for not finding this nonsense film funny or even entertaining ! after seeing mummies becoming undead and rising from the sand and enough gruesome killings to last me a few milleniums , all i can say is , mummies ! "
78,"this film is tied together by four tired soap opera tales , that are competently-crafted but predictable . in my humble opinion , this film could have been made by using only one of the stories , instead of making them into roughly four- 40 minute segments , each with a title flashed on the screen to indicate the start of the new story . it is hard to believe that this film won more awards than any other mexican film ever has ! it makes you wonder about the quality of film that didn't win an award . it happens just like that ! it is the usual tear-jerker fare seen on those afternoon soap operas on american tv . on the plus side , the stories are intricately woven together so that they make sense . there is much humor in the telling of the stories and the acting is decent . otherwise , this plays mostly as glorified soap opera , with few surprises in all of its lengthy presentation . "
79,"you see , this mr . perfect turns out to be a madman . he exhibits signs of being a control freak , someone who might even be a nut case , by taking everything so literal and acting in a robotic and deliberate fashion when he speaks , so that everything he does seems out of place . in fact , the acting in the film by everyone is really fine , especially considering how thin the script was . it is the story itself and the way it is directed that leads to the detriment of the film , allowing it to have the look of one of those films made only to be seen as a rental video , which indeed is how this film was released . the film tries to play like noir , but only ends up being the kind of fake noir that is more irritating than complimentary . it tries to be purposefully evasive about its storyline and to have its tenuous story be based on chance as being the sole determinant of life . what it eventually becomes is a predictable psycho flick and not an unpredictable noir film , as it wanted to be . it has trapped itself into being a film without a plot , with rotten dialogue , and a fake means of maintaining tension . it tries so hard to give itself a weird angle through its characterizations , which only work on a superficial level-from the neurotic damsel-in-peril , plummer- to the split personality performance of forster , whose actions waiver between maniacally calm reasoning to histrionic schmaltz , as he goes off the deep end reciting rhymes . the main problem , which the film is never able to overcome , is that the storyline is not that compelling and that the characters are not necessarily interesting even if they are quirky . the story never had a real strength to it ; it always seemed like the actors were play-acting , that the script was struggling to device another gimmick to go with the coin toss motif , instead of letting the story seem to come about out of its own accord . this did not help explore anything going on inside the characters , only trivializing the story further , making it rely solely on a gimmick to tell its story . what we are left with is a series of encounters among characters who are not that appealing in the first place , and also by the end of the film , we know only a little more about the psychopath than we did from the opening scene . i therefore wasn't sure what the director wanted to accomplish , except he probably thought by showing how idiosyncratic all the characters could be , that would be enough to get it over . if that was what he was thinking , he misjudged the quality of the film , but not before he showed flashes of talent here and there , for example , in the opening scene in the desert --- forster's calm demeanor was played-off beautifully against plummer's nervous energy , and with the desert lurking as a hostile backdrop to the action , it added a thrilling surreal sense of dramatics to the story . but the film fell too quickly into the serial-killer mode , and lost the edge it never had but always wanted . "
80,"high fidelity ( director : stephen frears ; screenwriters : d . v . this wormy role is one that he has been seemingly typecast for in most of his films to date . his narcissistic performance totally grossed-me out , even though i liked a few things about this feel-good , quirky movie , but whose plot could have been better explored if it was discovered what the plot was and whose story would have been given more credence if it had a sharper script , a better sense of pacing , and less screen time for the annoying cusack character . cusack spent nearly ninety percent of the film's time looking right at the camera and explaining to the audience what he was thinking and doing , as if the story was made for an einstein-type and needed to be decifered to the under-thirty something audience targeted to see this film . rob is griping to the camera about his failures in romance , and in imitation of the david letterman's tv show shtick of making lists to elicit laughs from the audience , rob is prone to making top 5 lists , having recently completed his "" top 5 all-time breakups "" , going through those he most clearly recalls , giving the audience a running narration on each of those romances . by gosh , what is this fine comedic actress doing in this film , and to the bargain , taking such a miniscule part ! laura ( iben hjejle-a danish actress making her american debut ) is the best thing about this film . her lips are of a succulent ruby red color , and when she pouts or a small smile comes over her , there is a very sensuous crease that comes over her mouth and chin area-- plus she has a nice laugh and cries in a dignified manner when she has to . what the film does well , is capture the nostalgia and musty atmosphere of a place where music geeks hang-out , memorizing tunes and reciting them back-and-forth to each other , as if they were idiot savants who overdosed on sugar . he's a van morrison clone without the singer's voice or forebearance or manners . the clerks' attitude toward the customers was brusque , but the exchanges that resulted were very dear . in keeping with the spirit of the film , i made a top 5 list of things i liked about the film and a more involved top 5 list of things that i didn't like about the film . first what i liked : 1 . the soundtrack kicked ass . 2 . the two musical geek clerks were funnier than batman and robin in hell . i didn't have to pronounce iben hjejle's name to know what i liked about her . 4 . lisa bonet made up for her inconsequential part and gratuitous sex scene by adding a beautiful song to the film and a warm presence to a story that wasn't that hot to begin with . i can count on my left hand how many films were made about geek music-store clerks who work in musical stores that are not in a mall . what i didn't like : 1 . john cusack is either a putz or someone who is acting like a putz , but in either case , i can't handle watching a needlessly long film ( over two hours ) such as this one , with someone as self-absorbed as he is , without getting a headache . 2 . the story seemed to be a never-ending one , where there were at least three times that i thought the movie had wound down and was about to conclude . instead , the movie got a second wind and added more banal storyline to keep it going . it seemed to be poorly edited and written with a few different endings in mind and failed to make its rewrites seamless . the result is a very shoddy film , even if it is adapted from a popular cult comic novel of the same name written by nick hornsby . the film has not been improved by changing the setting from london to chicago , and as far as i'm concerned , it could have been set in mars or venus , with the same results gleaned . the love angle was predictable and wimpy . but this was formula sitcom stuff all the way , as all three music geeks got some reward for their long-suffering for the art of nostalgia and trivia and useless knowledge . 4 . for a movie that is about growing up , maturing , and handling relationships , somehow the characters didn't particularly make me interested in how any of their relationships were resolved . i felt used by this film . and i had to listen to him kvetch for the entire film and i'm not even a psychoanalyst who gets paid to hear such dribble but a long-suffering movie critic who was bored to death by this very forgettable pop culture movie and couldn't wait for the session ( uh ! movie ) to end . "
81,"it's a post-war baroque melodrama , creaky as wooden steps in an old mildewed house might be . it's from the german ? migr ? director , john brahm , who gives this genre a decidedly european flavor . "" the locket "" has something to say about a person with a severe personality disorder needing the proper psychological therapy . it was too wooden a presentation to generate anything but a few sparks . but the way of telling the story by flashbacks within flashbacks , from the view of the male lovers who were deceived by the pert heroine , nancy blair ( laraine day ) , is visually unconventional , and the story itself , is cleverly diverting . this was one role that was not suited for his temperament . it's one of the few performances i thought he was awful in . this action disappoints nancy . as an added bit of melodramatics , blair cracked up over this and was institutionalized , and only recently was released . it's a somber story , with a lot of heavy-handed things going on . the plot devices were too leaden to be fully credible , but the complexities of the heroine's character were well presented . the analyst's comments about her stealing to get even with mrs . willis , seemed to be a reasonable explanation , if taken on face value . but that doesn't answer her ability to murder or her depraved indifference to men while pretending to like them . the locket only had some glitter but not enough substance to make its aims lucidly felt . though , as muddled as it was , it still kept me alert , wanting to know what gives . the problem is , that i never found out what gives . "
82,"a far-fetched and schmaltzy hollywood-style mainstream tale about time travel . to buy into this half-baked sci-fi wannabe , one has to have a suspension of disbelief and of all rational thought . if the catch-the-killer subplot had any real suspense to it , i might have bit more for this nonsense storyline . but that thriller part doesn't even hold up with your average tv detective show . but this story is unfortunately overtaken by its weak serial killer story . thereby , the film is reduced to overreaching its credibility by confusingly switching back and forth between past and future events , sloppily changing one for the other , until nothing made sense , since you have to keep changing both simultaneously to alter both dimensions and the film fails to accomplish that storyline with accurate details . the acting was surprisingly good , despite the poor script . dennis quaid is a throwback father -- one that many a child would gladly appreciate . if the film did one thing right , it showed a family that was really together and good to see on the screen , especially with all the recent films mostly showing only dysfunctional families . it was refreshing to see one for a change with a father as a good role model , even if some might find this relationship too corny . gregory hoblit ( primal fear/fallen ) has fallen into the trap of going overboard in his use of sentimentality , which overtakes the film and makes it too gooey for comfort . also , his directing suffers from an inability to tell a good detective story , even if his idea on time travel is intriguing . unfortunately , the time travel story does not hold up to any intelligent scrutiny . so what is left , is a movie that should find its own audience with those who find the father/son relationship meaningful and find the time travel concept to be entertaining .

85,"a modern day comedy taking place in havana , cuba , that is laced with supernatural implications , as it is directed with artful flourishes by fernando perez . in the pulsating background , capturing the whimsical mood of those who live in havana , is the staccato music of bola de nieve and benny more . but the film suffers greatly in making every single thing that happens pertain to a heavy-handed metaphorical symbol . the hallucinatory story , as a result , is dumbed-down , so much so , that it loses whatever strength and vision it might have had . the film is heavy with quotes like that one , as if these cute little slogans can really explain life in cuba . the film lost its focus and painted an artificially whimsical picture of cuba , that was hardly relevant or enlightening . whatever pleaure there was in the film , came from its splendid ballet numbers , the beautiful artistic framing of its shots , and its bouncy music . but that was outweighed by how it was weighed down from its symbolism . "
86,"it is a call for artistic freedom , but interestingly enough , this political film shies away from offering any significant political commentary . a performance artist eats a bar of soap with a knife and fork and is revolted by what he eats , almost as much as the audience is revolted by seeing him go through that routine . this was a hard scene to swallow as not being a contrived one and a very forced metaphor on the political situation , though it provided some much needed levity rather than any particular increase in political insights . the last 20 minutes of the film offers a surprise twist to the story and thereby saves it somewhat from the doldrums it was in . it results in a film that gets its message across that freedom is frozen in china , that things are still far from democratic . it was a though-provoking film , but in a very manipulative way , that was none too pleasing to view despite its good intentions . "
87,"this girls' sitcom film is strictly fluff , with a few comical moments succeeding in a long line of misfires . the girls try so hard to be funny by making faces and doing slapstick , that it is a shame that the storytelling ability of the director is so poor , that it undermines the comedy . it is imitative of a dumb boys' film , with the same way of irritating you . to provide some nyc character atmosphere , we have the girls' landlord ( brennan ) demanding rent from the girls in a strident nyc accent . whatever that means , it was the funniest moment in a film that couldn't get to central park if it was standing on it . "
88,"a vigorously played aip submarine b-film , with a no-name cast and low-budget special effects . all the enlisted men talk in an unnatural jargon , which is make-believe navy talk , that is sometimes irritating on the ol' cranium and at other times slightly amusing to the proletarian in me . this is basically a harmless ww11 war film that is watchable for insomniacs turning the tv dials late at night in search of something benign . it is one of those rare 1950s ww11 films where the japs are not even cursed out -- the men could have been fighting the greeks and no one would have known the difference . one of those 'gung ho' movies , where the only dissension comes from one of the officers who goes over-the-top in being too gung ho . i recommend this film for those who didn't like "" the yellow submarine "" but like any other submarine film which doesn't have a cast of rock singers . this is one of those films that has a simple plot and pads it with supposedly human interest stories , as it highlights one character from among the officers and one from the enlisted men . halsey's acting efforts nearly sabotaged the film , as his strained performance was just blah ! the film's purpose was to build tension for its action-packed climax , but by having an inferior complex because of the thinness of the story and the characters all being dullards , an effort was made instead to show how courageous the captain was and how he was , predictably , able to win the men over to his side . "
89,"m : i-2 , the sequel to mission impossible , is a james bond wannabe film , but it fails to even come close to that film in wit , humor , and entertainment value . it tries to be a spy/romance movie , but without any suspense the film just looks like it's an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses . it is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human . the coolest thing about this movie , was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie , was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols . the film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence . except for the choreographed action sequences , the film was dull for three-quarters of its time , filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed . as for the action scenes , they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films , but their advertisement for sadistic responses , is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence , which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen . m : i-2 opens and closes with fast-paced action scenes , but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue . the film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus , at that point . the only thing that kept me awake , was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film's supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way . it's a mega-buck film adapted from a popular high-tech gadgetry tv series . but its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it , and it failed to produce a story that had any substance . the star of the film and co-producer , tom cruise , and his romantic interest , thandie newton , are miscast . cruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile , as he tries to carry off this macho role , while thandie is not an action-film girl , and seems like a fish- out-of-water in this one . their romance didn't work , not only was it tepid and not sexy , but it wasn't convincing . the film opens with dizzying speed , perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success . he also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain . which explains the film's mythic theme . . . as the one who played the villain , dougray scott , does so in a one-dimensional gruff tone , which did not distinguish him in that role . at least , if the film got the villain part right , it might have had some fun with this nonsense . we already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face/off and in the original mission impossible , which as convoluted a plot as that film had , it was still a superior film to this sequel . woo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground , as it is used so often in this film by both sides , so much so , that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain . it makes it seem as if anyone could be another character , which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense . hopkins then signs off with the tag line : this message will self-destruct in five seconds . actually , with the departure of hopkins , it was this disposable film that actually self-destructed at this point . robert towne , the screenwriter , who contributed to the first "" mission , "" who is noted for doing "" chinatown "" -- writes a colorless , pedestrian script , one that fails even to be funny in a camp way . if i was only entertained by this . . . i could have lived with it . but this film was so badly made , that it was like watching a highlight film of a basketball game , seeing only the slam-dunks , but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast . in any case , this is a critic-proof film , and will in all probability do well in the box office , as it was made to appeal to all the demographics who find commercial ventures like this one easy to buy into . "
90,"a promising near-future , sci-fi adventure film , whose leaden direction , weak acting , and incredibly inadequate set designs , cause the good premise to collapse into an apocalyptic failure by the time the film was resolved . this film should have been entertaining , but instead felt tiresome . there was no fun to be had , no noteworthy dramatics , dialogue , or story developed . "
91,"gregg araki ( the living end/totally f * * * ed up ) professes in the opening credits that this is a movie about heterosexuals , as opposed to his other films about queers . but that is really a dubious distinction , as the sex is mindless , violent , and bawdry . many of the visuals displayed homo-erotic actions , and the film is about as romantic as a stool sample . it is an offensive film , made to parody other hollywood teenager films , by taking digs at do-gooders , the moral majority , the right-wing , the fundamentalist religions , and pop culture . but the film is so vacuous and poorly thought out , that it comes off as strictly an in-your-face stylized film , without coming up to breathe fresh air or manage to say anything worthwhile . the parody seems so cold and distant , and it comes from lowlifes who have peanuts for brains , which makes their attempts at black comedy seem futile . it was difficult to be amused by a film that was so childish , its dialogue so banal , and its whole purpose tied to being shocking . the enjoyment from the film , for those who get their jollies from watching something that is this gross and sexually hideous , is the flaunting of morality and the depravity in the violence . xavier explains his tattoo of jesus on his dick , by telling amy , he put it there , so people could say , i've got jesus inside me . besides spewing out green slime and still talking , the severed head rolls on the floor . there is a running gag about 666 and about religious or do-gooder slogans in every store ; one store has this slogan --up with hope -- down with dope . i guess this is supposed to mean that these three have bad karma . after seeing all the mayhem , absorbing the teens in action , watching how retarded and alienated they are , the film felt as healthy as a diet of fast-food , crystal meth ( speed ) , and shotguns . it failed to show the l . a . underground kids it made as stars of the film , as anything but cartoon characters . in some perverse way , i would recommend this as a blind date movie in a drive-in , for those young guys who want to see how their dates will react to all the grossness onscreen . for others , who might be taken with teenager films , but in a healthier and more comical way , stick with someone committed to making bad films about teens , such as ray steckler . all his flicks are funnier than this one .

92," gun shy  puts in a lot of effort to be zanier than the other mobster comedy films it takes the same theme as , except here it is a lawman instead of a hood who is suffering from anxiety attacks and is in need of seeing a shrink . he has a chronic stomach problem , which is used as a running gag throughout . everything is played for laughs ; fidel and fulvio are cartoon figures , with the only difference being oliver platt is funny and jose zuniga is seen as either being psychotic or preening , but he's not funny . this is tv writer eric blakeney's debut feature as director-writer , and he gets mixed reviews . the comedy was mild , the script was choppy , and the story had an inane charm to it , but no more . the usually bland liam neeson had more of a flare for this type of farce than i thought he would have and platt , in his inimical style , got off a few good one-liners , such as "" fun is overrated . "" sandra bullock , whose acting career is spinning ever-downward , had a small role that only required she look good in that oversized shirt she likes to always wear . overall , the comedy was too slight , as was everything else about this film , to make it more than passable entertainment . its nearest relative in ganster comedy films is "" analyze this "" ( gun shy was made before that film ) , but this film didn't have de niro as its star , which made this film seem not as good , though it was on the same level . but , if you ask me to state confidentially , the worst thing one can say about this film , i would say that it suffered from too much flatulence . "
93,"it is stiffly directed by philip haas ( angels and insects/the music of chance ) , whose wife belinda wrote the screenplay and was the film's editor . but , she is painted into such a silly corner in the romance , that the film never had a chance to do anything but pant heavily for close to two hours . this is a token of her patrician generosity , as she figures , this guy's a refugee running away from the nazis , i might as well give him something wonderful to remember for the rest of his life , so if he goes back to the concentration camp he , at least , will have some pleasant memories . the problem with this melodramatic scene , was that the acting was shrill and the outcome was hardly convincing . she mentions to flint that she slept with the violin player because "" my heart was full of tenderness and pity . "" to inject some comedy into this dull film , derek jacobi has a small part as a drag queen , offering mary his support . while anne bancroft shamelessly culls laughs for her performance as a gossip-mongering high-class slut , who has a contemptable attitude toward people . both performers chew the scenery . i found this stiff upper lip film to be ridiculous ; the acting and directing robotic . the film lacked tension , it was not erotic , and the story went out of its way not to make sense . the only thing about this movie that pleased me , was how it couldn't ruin the splendor of the beautiful florence countryside and its splendidly graceful edifices , as florence is lushly photographed in all its magnificence . "
94,"a farcical political drama , done in the manner of a tv spoof . an ensemble cast carries off the comedy by making use of irony , as it shows in a clich ? d manner how the british are stand-offish and all the immigrants are earthy people . what it fails to do is tell a coherent story , as everything about this exaggerated tale is hopelessly lost in a sea of silliness . isn't that extraordinary ? "" there was an attempt to show that besides speaking the same language and looking alike , the two feuding ethnic groups have a lot in common . this film , commissioned by the british film institute , and made for a budget of about 1 . 8 million dollars and shot in 35 days , is rife with rapid cuts and scenes that seem disjointed and unconnected , it just seems like an incomplete movie , and one that rubbed me the wrong way with its pat messages . but , i must say , it did win the prix un certain regard for best film at the 1999 cannes film festival .

"" lady hester sets the tone and proper standards for how this snooty group behaves . the film ends on a melodramatic note , and if this wasn't supposed to be a true story , it would be one that was hard to fathom . this was a ridiculous movie ; it was an apathetic sudser with flat dialogue , stiff characterizations , and if it didn't take place in florence , where art is a way of life , this film would be a feckless fiasco . it is hard to believe that luca is franco zeffirelli , he seemed so out of it , the role seemed to have nothing to say , as if he wasn't there when he was there , and his heroics as a 17-year-old with the resistance movement seemed unconvincing . also , the actor who played him , baird wallace , was very stiff and made his presence felt in a very awkward manner . since the film is supposedly about the director blossoming to become a great artist , i saw no evidence of this . this is a fourth-rate production . "
97,"the film has no point to make but to emphasize that silly challenge , but , it at least softens its obnoxious attitude with an ending that is more satisfactory than what i expected from this shallow film . i can't see anyone but teenagers and , perhaps , hapless parents of teenagers , finding anything here of interest . though some adults might look back to those halcyon school days with an anxious leer and wish to recapture some pubescent memories of some shameful incident and to feel the nostalgia again through this movie . looking through the eyes of a lost adolescence is perhaps the only way to view this movie , a movie that makes sex into something that is implicitly evil . nevertheless , as awful as this gross-out film is , it will become a movie and video hit with its targeted youthful audience , following the footsteps of that other cheap thrill movie , "" there's something about mary , "" and because sex sells , other films like this one will unfortunately follow . the sexual awkwardness of the boys is exaggerated for comedic purposes , and the school looks as if it is around only as a stage for the teenager's rite-of-passage . everything in the film is used to get a laugh , but the film wasn't really funny , though its commercial success is due to the guilty laughs it evokes . for me , it was just a childishly gross and a sexually raunchy movie . but it smartly restrained itself and never pushed the envelope that step too far , staying well within the framework of how traditional sitcom comedy works . there were other gross-out scenes in a movie that had no edge , just embarrassing moments and vulgar gestures . if it weren't for all the grossness about sex and toilets , this would be a typical family-fare tv sitcom . the film sells itself through its sex scenes and then after exploiting every awkward sexual moment it possibly can from the teens , it reverses itself with a contrived moral ending to say that love is not forced and comes naturally , while those only interested in sex are creating unnecessary problems for themselves and putting undue pressure on themselves to be happy . his big deal , is that he can't say the four-lettered word love -- like , i love you vicky . the side players add to the gross-out gags . he is a particularly rich and obnoxious jock . a totally unnecessary scene , that was played without emotion or reason . the film's saving grace is the sound advice given about romance by the females . everything else about the film was just as gross as it appeared to be . the unimaginative comedy is of the lowest level , meant to titillate those in need of a teenage sexual massage . "
98,"the screenplay was written by dorothy azner , who made it into a statement film about women being abused in a male-dominated society . the sympathetic jury comes in with a not guilty verdict . the film itself was unconvincing and too banal to strike a chord with me . it therefore doesn't surprise me , that , perhaps , gabrielle wasn't as nice a person as portrayed in the film . this film is worth a look only for historical reasons , to see how melodrama was done before there were talkies . "
99,"there's nothing that isn't predictable about this sappy formula sob story and there's nothing about this flat romance between these two good-looking upper-middle-class yuppies that is endearing . it is a disappointing film , lacking imagination , turgidly acted , and laden with a mechanical script , a real downer after the director's more sweeping last film , "" xiu-xiu : the sent down girl . "" they haven't seen each other for some time , so i guess granny has a memory lapse of what she thinks of him , as for some inexplicable reason she helps get this romance started . it was unnecessary because this silly girl who loves to say wow , is dying to go out with him . he quickly gets her to bed , but honoring the old-fashioned conventions of films shot in the 1930s , we don't get to see any sex . the next morning the playboy deceptively tells her that he is too old for her , and then gives her his standard non-commitment speech , "" all i'm able to offer you is this--what we have right now--until it ends . we have no future . "" his job in the film is to say clich ? lines that reprimmand gere for being such a cad to women . i guess in the way this film looks at things , that would be a terrible retribution . gere can only tell her that he felt like having sex with her , it was no big deal . to pile on some more weepie scenes , winona keeps fainting and gere keeps trying to find a miracle to save her . since everything about this film is manipulative , the odds are 4 to 5 against her living , since this film is just as corny and as predictable as the 1970 film "" love story . "" this is basically an exterior movie , as manhattan is warmly photographed , but the interiors of the two lovers was never made to seem warm . the romance never rung true and the stars did not have a good chemistry together . gere seemed to be content to be in love with himself , always smugly smiling while everyone said how handsome he was , while ryder was too shrill to be engaging . at one point in their romance , ryder when in central park , waxes poetic and tells him , "" i can smell the rain . "" she then coos and makes a contorted face of pleasure , and with this trite dialogue and mushy call for love , amid the autumn splendor of the golden leaves beautifully photographed by changwei gu , we are asked to believe that these unreal lovers are for real . "
100,"a showtime original movie that results in a very strained comedy/mystery story , one that is more stupid than offbeat and less noir than in the mode of a sophomoric film school work . it tries so hard to waver between reality and being completely off-the-wall , until it succumbs to being mostly annoying and far too cute looking for it to be appealing , yet not funny enough to be worth the effort of setting up such an inane story . i can only recommend it for those who want to see amanda plummer perform her magical acting ability as a psychic . she can do no wrong , no matter how rotten this made-for-tv film is or how ridiculous her part is , as she sticks out like a rose in a weed garden , plying her talents as a sex-craved psychic for the police . the wonder view apartments has a swimming pool that is polluted with slime and filled with debris and it has an assortment of odd and annoying tenants , from wise guy roller skaters to corny lovebirds . all the while , the story revolves around stan's study of psychology in the sterile college atmosphere , where rats are experimented in a maze to study human behavior , which is compared to how invigorating it is to study people's behavior in a real setting , as he finds people in this setting act the same way the rats behave in a maze . this might have been funny , if there was some credulity to their picking on the dumbfounded stan , who has an airtight alibi . but the film defeated itself by trying to be both real and absurd , thereby nothing caught fire , it all seemed like every man and woman was out for themselves to see if they can get a laugh somehow from a story that was going nowhere . the film failed doubly , both as a comedy and as a mystery . there were so many gaps in the story , that one can easily make a case that nothing made sense and what was funny , was merely only silly . this is a low point in storytelling , as the director has failed to keep this shallow film above even the low water mark it set for itself . "
101,"another formula 'feel good' quirky comedy from the british isles , much like "" waking ned devine , "" and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line . it is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin . the strength of this film lies in its rational theme , that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol . the film is tolerable until after its first hour , it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas . but its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message . its message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the 'war on drugs' is about to be escalated into colombia . everything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war . the film's mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never . there has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether . it is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail . things work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood . there are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded . ummm ! "
102,"there is some nasty action , lots of bad guy mafia men talking tough to good small town people kind of stuff , but the film was too dry to be anything but mediocre . "
103,"michael dinner's geezer mobster comedy has a funny premise but falters on the execution part , as the yuks come , but not often enough to sustain the predictability and staleness about the film . the film tried hard to be funny and genial , but this idea for a film has been done too often in recent times to appear fresh . whatever went wrong , must be blamed on the poor direction and poor script . this film needed such an intensive voiceover like i need to have sand kicked in my face at the beach , it just ruined the flow of the story and prevented the story from being a movie experience rather than an exercise in trying to cover up the film's inability to tell a story . the film keeps adding on sub-plots and the comedy keeps getting stifled with the added weight of the new sub-plots . it isn't enough to make the four of them out to be mobsters , but they also must now be deemed as good guys , so the film goes to unneeded lengths to show how wonderful they are . the director had a barrage of proven comic material to work with , an able cast ( except for burt reynolds-he was terribly miscast ) , yet the film falls flat on its face . everything about it seemed like a mistaken pratfall . the comic timing was off , the story sagged , and the characters had nothing up their sleeves but old jokes and comedy routines that weren't even funny most of the time , ones that seemed out of place . with yuks like that , all i can say is "" oy gevalt , "" give me a break , get some fresh material already ! it might have been the funniest scene of the film , just to see their silly expressions as he leads them out a back door onto the street . i also left the theater by way of the rear door , and i also had a look of consternation on my face , wondering how easy it would have been to make this a much better film with just a little better effort in working the script . "
104,"a comedy flavored by hippie nostalgia for the '60s . it has its moments of reliving the past before it turns into a silly and unimportant film , which could only say things that are clich ? s . before the film looses its grip on its subject matter and becomes too contrived and lightweight , as the opposing parties wind up on the same side -- it had some sparkling scenes with the hippie conversing with the stone-faced fbi man . this briefly encourages huey , because he is feeling down that no one remembers him anymore , disgusted that the hippies are a forgotten culture in the 1980s . at this point the film breaks down into the absurd and the comedy comes in dribbles instead of gushes , as the running gag over mistaken identity comes to a brutal end . by this time i was forgetting how much i enjoyed hopper's manic but egotistical performance and wanted the film to end before it lost all its appeal for those who were hippies back then . there's lots of '60s music in the background to remember the past , such as , dylan songs , hendrix and grace slick singing , and there is enough hippie memorabilia crammed into the story to give an aging hippie a temporary high . but the film itself , it was irrelevant . "
105,"a mild thriller that has the glossy atmospheric look of a riveting horror film but not the impactful story to pull off this foolish sadistic killer tale in a reasonable manner , which results in one of the stupidest endings imaginable . it is a film that is done in the genre's formula mold , laying on all those mindless gory contrivances that horror fans have seen before , it is also a tale that has more holes in it than a new york city junkie . there is a twinkling of romance in their eyes , but he can't do anything about it because of his physical condition . the climactic romantic scene has amelia caressing his index finger -- which goes for love in this film . the best part of the movie was the chemistry between the two . it's just too bad that the film was so manipulative , dull-witted , spewing bad dialogue as easily as steam that oozes out of a broken steam pipe , as the whole venture just seemed absurd . he tells her some dribble about destiny , that destiny is what you make it -- if it's a gift you have for forensics , don't blow it . this dialogue is b movie material stuff , and that the stars talk this talk throughout the film , is a credit to them that they do it with straight faces . their faces have star quality written all over it and even though this role doesn't determine if she can act or not , it does show that her face , like his , shines like a star , as the movie camera is very kind to the two of them . the film builds up to its hokey conclusion by firstly misleading the audience who the killer is , then it has the killer confront and attack rhyme in a campy way , even biting him like a vampire in the neck . its appeal might be that it is so absurd , so lacking in tension and quality filmmaking , that one might be lulled into its state of languor and accept it for what it is : another horror movie in a long line of such films that should be a staple at the drive-in or as a movie rental for insomniacs who choose not to rent porno to get their cheap thrills . "
106,"a poorly done documentary that is superficially entertaining , whose blurred camerawork , its failure to get hold of its subject in anything but a self-promoting manner , and its campy playing with the criminal scandals and lawsuits that became front-page news fraught with sex charges and fraud in fund-raising is done in a witless manner , which leaves me scratching my worldly head about why this farcical film was made or why it thinks this would make tammy faye , the subject of the film , look better than the national joke she is . the only thing this film clearly revealed about tammy faye , is that she loves to be in front of the camera , is terribly vain , is addicted to diet-coke , wears tons of makeup and wears her emotions on her sleeve , mistakeningly thinking she's an old-fashioned girl who likes real things when we clearly see otherwise ; and most importantly , she wears loreal mascara and has permanently false eyebrows ( which is her trademark ) , and that her lips are permanently lined . since i didn't care about her when she was riding high in the 1960s and 1970s and early 1980s , and i didn't care about her when she was banished from christian tv because of her disgrace , i wondered what this documentary would present that would change my mind about her , so i at least could care somewhat about her . but it failed to get me to see her in any other light than that of a self-absorbed publicity hound and someone who is superficial to the point of being a caricature of someone who is superficial , though if she is compared to those other christian hypocrites -- like her ex-husband jim bakker , jerry falwell , and pat robinson , she passes the likability test with flying colors . the film's aim seems to be nothing less than a rehabilitation project in the public image on tammy faye messner , the once queen of televangelism but the now exile in the world of christian televangelism . this reasoning on her part does not wash with me . rupaul charles does the narration , honing in solely on tammy's point of view . we don't know much more about jim bakker from this work , other than a few trivial crumbs of polished gloss tammy throws our way . i didn't buy into her act and i didn't find the film funny , when it should have been both a scream and a much more informative piece than what was presented . but if one has such low expections of tammy , as i surmise most do who are out of range of her choir , then some of those might find that she is more likable than they first thought . but don't include me as one her converts . i came away with the same trashy opinion of her i had before i saw this "" mock "" documentary . he might be right , i'm sure she'll even survive this movie about her . "
107,"the provocative title tells it all , a pretentious satire on the negro myth of him being a stud to white ladies . the film is adapted from the novel by haitian author dany laferri ? re . the thin story never moves far away from its sophomoric attempt to shock and irritate a white male audience about its simplistic findings , but something that is certainly thought of in a very real way and taken to be a serious generalization by western society . to accomplish this parody , everyone in the film becomes a clich ? figure , with the main stud taking on every positive sexual myth of his prowess that he could about how good in bed the negro is . it seems this film will have you believe that every white girl in the film is dying to try out this sex god for themselves , and with the stud evoking what goes for a cool attitude , too willing to please one and all , the film becomes ridiculous in its banality without getting to how racist its theme is . the film by reducing everyone to being what their color of skin is , as it fails to get at truths that are more than skin-deep . this is film that fell in love with its generalizations and can't go further than that , even failing to draw comic relief from its stupid characterizations or making the protagonist anything but obnoxious and terribly vain . if the main character in a spicy spoof like this one , can't be likable , then the film has no chance of succeeding . it was a difficult film to just see this as a playful venture , which it should have been , but what made matters worse , was that it took itself seriously and tried to make a forced case about racial prejudice , using absurd scenes to try and show how white men feel inferior to the negro when it comes to sex and therefore will do anything to get back at the negro . i assume this film was trying to be funny , but its story was so full of generalizations that it was not possible to get by that and see people as they really are and not as stereotypes . this film probably does more harm to racial relations than it does good . it is a film that the kkk could easily agree with its findings , failing to see that the film was meant to be tongue-in-cheek . and that's the problem with the film , the satire had no power , as the film seemed more real than ironic . jacques w . beno ? t's french-canadian film is a dehumanizing experience , a film of missed opportunities to explore interracial realtionships , it is so dehumanizing that it doesn't even give the girls real names the stud has sex with , they are just given names like miz literature , miz tickle-tickle , miz redhead , and so on . outside of his sex , it is hard to find anything he does that is even remotelty interesting . that he wishes to be a writer and succeeds at it by the film's finale , typing as if he were banging on a drum , was hard to swallow . the only thing that was credible about the stud , was the enormous ego he had , it must have been as big as his . . . well , you know what i mean . "
108,"it's possible for peter greeaway ( "" drowning by numbers "" / "" a zed and two noughts "" /``prospero's books'' ) to make a more boring sexual/erotic fantasy film , one that is more didactic and analytical , but not likely that he could duplicate one that is also so full of itself as this one was . it is the director's audacious opinion that he can get away without having a story to go with the full frontal nudity display of men and women he flaunts throughout the film . it results in a torturous viewing experience , as pablum is spouted in verbose spurts of emotive stagy responses , while the reward for the viewer is a few stilted visual delights and a few restrained chuckles to be had at the absurdity of all the perversity . the film defies social conventions and commercial filmmaking sensibilities , something greenaway has built a reputation on , as his films are critic-proof , playing to art-house audience types who relish his deft camerawork and the cerebral challenges his films pose as puzzlers . if so , what a left-handed honor is bestown on fellini ! the father's response to the film is , "" how many film directors make films to satisfy their sexual fantasies ? "" the son says -- "" most of them . "" which is about the best way of explaining what this very personal film means for greenaway . the film didn't mean much to me , but it did say something about how women understand sex better than men and men are such children when it comes to sex . it brought up things that are taboo and showed how art is a metaphor for one's obsessions in sex . the film felt so much like attending a tedious college lecture in a fellini 101 course in perversity as expounded by the arid professor greenaway , that it turned into an anti-erotic movie , a text book type of film where you can bring in all sorts of intellectual things that weren't developed in the film , but were only hinted at , and thereby there will always be something perceived about the film to justify it as an erstwhile effort . "
109,"before hollywood got a hold of this theme , literature did . writers such as christopher marlowe , in his 16th century book on faust and goethe , writing about faust in the 18th century , used this theme . however , "" bedazzled "" is a remake of a more vulgar source for the faust legend , stanley donen's 1967 very funny satire , which starred ( and was written by ) peter cook and dudley moore . this "" bedazzled "" provides some lighthearted fun with the theme , but is not quite as wicked and not as funny . hurley gives this film its purpose and sense of tart humor , but even her role seems punchless and absurd . though , it is hard to understand why the geek wasn't more tuned into her and used one of the seven wishes granted to bag her instead of the rather ordinary frances . frances o'connor does an adequate job in a role that mainly requires her to be desirable in many different ways . she has a sweet smile and shows she can display a nifty tantrum , but compared to hurley's beauty and wit , she comes off second best in both categories and would not have been my first wish . all seven wishes are played out as comedy sketches , with some being terrible , filled with stereotype gags and dull-witted humor , such as the one where he becomes the witty author who is well-equipped but learns that he is gay ; some of them do have some spark , like the dumb giant n . b . a . the film uses the same actors who play fraser's unfriendly co- workers as comic characters in all the wish sketches , which adds a feeling of continuity , but it is played as if this material was more suited for a revue than a film . what this film lacked was a real sense of outrageousness , it seemed more like a benign tv comedy hour program than a satire that goes for something devilish . it painted too clean a picture of everyone . i think harold ramis could have come up with funnier and less obvious skits , there was a lot to play around with here that wasn't even attempted . the film went mostly for the physical humor of brendan fraser , who is no buster keaton and can't carry an entire film with his comic antics . the viewer watched him transform himself cleverly in each skit , but the film wasn't funny enough for it to sparkle that way , except in a few instances . i think when you make a remake , it should clearly be better than the other version or else it seems to me , there is no reason to make a remake . "
110,"this is a pointless b- film actioner , a remake of the gritty 1971 british noir classic directed by mike hodges , which had the good fortune to have michael caine be the star and to have a story with an edge to it . this "" get carter "" features mindless violence , an incoherent and uninvolving story , and most unfortunately the humorless presence of the miscast stallone as a vegas mob enforcer , going to seattle for the funeral of his bartender brother he hasn't seen for a long time . he is dressed in a tacky bright blue suit , sports a goatee , and speaks in a low voice . it is filmed amid some dazzling night shots of las vegas casinos and shots of a rainy seattle , though the rain has no effect on stallone's suit , it never gets soaked no matter how much he exposes it to the elements . it's a clich ? movie . . . so predictable , that if you didn't want to see the way the sleazy bad guys were going to get payback for what they did , you could have left the theater and figured out which way this macho stylish film was going by yourself . you would have missed nothing , there is absolutely nothing interesting about this film . it seems that stephen kay has taken a perfectly taut original film , which was nasty and unremitting to the core , and made a mess of the remake by trying to clean it up , making it into a sleazy film , nevertheless , but one with no redeeming features . he tries to give the film a moment of acting , hugging his niece in a warm embrace , as behind her back he grimaces with obvious pain on his teary face , assuring the audience to pay little attention to this human gesture , they shouldn't worry , he hasn't gone soft , there's going to be a payback . the most disgusting role in the film is reserved for "" gazillionaire "" computer geek alan cumming , he is the simpering coward , the most unmanly and therefore the most unseemly one in the film . it could have been built as the battle between the sleaze champ vs . the egomaniac . it's an undeveloped role , but caine is so good at getting credibility for his character , someone who pretends to have nothing to gain from the murder , who could therefore be honest about what happened , but is , of course , somehow involved in the cover-up . there are several other sleazes around , who have various things to add to the story , such as more gratuitous violence and a seamy look at their lives . since carter fails to heed such warnings , these two will clash in seattle . anyway , no minor b-thriller should be without such a car chase . the only positive spin i could put on this morose work , is to say that it could have been a lot worse , stallone could have talked in a loud voice . this is just another in a long list of films since the 1980s to try and resurrect sylvester stallone's "" comeback . "" this picture won't do . it lacks whatever suspense , character development , and ability to involve the viewer , that is needed . it only features the ego of stallone plodding his way in a shallow story . if you want to see "" get carter , "" rent the 1971 video . it's a nasty story , but it holds together in purpose and credibility , catching hold of the downtrodden newcastle atmosphere in a subtle way , something this film was never able to realize for seattle . "
111,"this parody of other gangster films suffers from a bad case of mindless imitation and hapless comedy that might be funny to someone in japan , but does not have a universal appeal . it is a parody of how the yakuza is portrayed in kitano films . it also pays homage to many other gangster films from around the world , including france's "" diva . "" it tries to take dramatic situations that occurred in those films and apply them out of context here , by poking fun at the hit man's mystique . sawaki when asked about his work , just feels his job is dull . noguchi asks him , "" does your heart ever thump with excitement like it did when you were a kid ? "" the fun in the film is mainly for film buffs , who will spot a wide variety of gangster films being used as a source for the levity here . the film's conclusion is a mixture of madcap comedy and an attempt to give meaning to all the lives of the dreamers who befriended sawaki . humor is subjective , you can't convince anyone that something was funny when they aren't laughing . i didn't laugh at what i was seeing , though i found the film to be stylish , shot in an outpouring of mellow brown and blue-gray shades . "
112,"a sitcom type of nonsensical comedy , one that has abolutely no bite . everyone in it is a cartoonish character , with the satire nonexistent and the comedy coming in a forced and heavy-handed manner derived from its physical comedy . it is such a forgettable film , that i forgot it 3/4 of the way through . if there is anything amusing about this film , which is doubtful , it comes at awkward moments for the two convicts , who are trapped into being perceived as homosexuals . their romance seemed artificial , sort of like filler stuff for the fluff story . not to be undone by harry , wayne has an equally unconvincing romance with miss shaefer . and to make things fit the formula pattern of this very soft satire , chappy and harry start dating . this romance was just as unconvincing as the others . the convicts are caught in awkward tender moments , which is where the comic effort is always going . if this were on tv , where it belongs as a sitcom , there would be canned laughter during the mock romantic scenes . this bank robbery is the final clumsy attempt to draw laughs out of its unconvincing story , but this robbery scene was too witless to watch without cringing . the film lacked the art of making these situations funny . . . it didn't know how to draw satire out of situations that were set to be mocked . the actors were pleasant . . . but they just weren't too funny or believable . "
113,"the same old romantic comedy formula story that has become a hollywood trademark is revived here , only this time its formula involves 'beverly hills conveniently meeting notting hill . ' give me a break , who in their right mind is seriously asking that question . the answer lies in the shekels found in the box office over the years , as this trite story line , the romance between opposites and the cute obstacles layed before them , seems to draw its fateful audience ever since hollywood was a hill that filmmakers put up a lettered sign on . what the film is 'banking' on , is the star personalities will continue to do their trick and milk their charms for mucho profit . roberts will fill the screen with her innocent and bountiful smile and grant will exploit that hangdog stereotype look he has cornered the market on , of one who is naturally shy but is persistent . they ape playing themselves as parodies , though who knows what they are really like , which is irrelevant , anyway . what is added to this often tried and tested screen formula , is pg-13 safe humor and a mild story where love blossoms in the way hollywood wills it to . think of any cary grant screwball comedy vehicle and you will know that this plot has been perfected in a much better way in other films . unfortunateley this film is not on the same level of cary's films . screenwriter richard curtis' dull workmanlike script seems to have the knack in getting to hugh grant's screen presence , the one that brings the paying audience in , as he previously did for him in "" four weddings and a funeral , "" but can't go further than that . roger michell's direction is predictable and lackluster , and the film itself is simply old stuff served again , dried out except for those who still find these superficial stars charming enough to think that this plot is viable again . there is no accounting for taste and who has taste , and no one's taste is better than your own , so if you like the stars then you will probably like the film no matter what . when superstar anna comes into humble william's bookstore and gets a book on turkey , you can guess the direction the rest of the film will travel to . there are no surprises here , unless you consider her soul kiss of william as she hurriedly leaves to be a surprise . they pop up all through the story to give the film its kooky british flavor and homey feeling . reality is blended so finely into the story that it never gets in the way of the fantasy romantic comedy happenings . it does what hollywood always does , give hope to those in the audience that fantasies can come true . you can bet your fairy tale book collection , that after hugh grant will go through all the obligatory obstacle courses required in the formula story , he will prevail and get julia roberts . the comedy unfolds as we watch how gracious the self-absorbed roberts is to the plebians , even confessing to them about her perpetual diet and that she's a bad actress making $15 million a picture , and we also see how nice and whacky the ordinary brits are , fawning over the american screenstar . since julia is not a blushing innocent in this film , she takes on the role of the one calling the shots , the film will go through all the formula tested tribulations in their relationship , with her looking less attractive to me than looking like she's a hardened woman with an empty soul . the only one in the film that had any fun in him that was sometimes funny , was grant's slob welsh flatmate , spike ( rhys ) , who spreads his goofiness around like it was manna from heaven , until even his dressed-down comic efforts feel forced . but , without his presence , even if his role was also a stereotype one , this asinine film would have been even more unbearable than it was . "" notting hill "" takes you to a low point on the movie making hill , where you can step on horseshit and curse out loud or pretend that it is not horseshit or be a man about it and say you fell into it , just like the filmmaker expected you to , and honestly say you like horseshit and don't care what anyone else thinks . this is the kind of film hollywood makes best . . . it's so easy to make and the romance is so painless . give me a bloody break . . . ! "
114,"a rather mild comedy/mystery , filmed in b&w , featuring the bumbling comic antics of jack lemon and the ravishing beauty of kim novak . under richard quine's laborious direction , the film plods along until it perks up for its surprising ending , which is a takeoff on those slapstick silent comedies . the film failed to catch my interest even though the actors seemed to be giving an all out effort to make this turkey have legs . the main problem lies in the ridiculous script . his part was so wooden , you could have thrown it into the fireplace for kindling wood . the hilarious moments come , as lemon bumbles around while courting the mysterious kim . its offbeat comedy just didn't resonate with me . i found the production too dry and hardly on par with those buster keaton vehicles it tried to emulate and the mystery story was too lame-brain an effort to cause any fuss over . this one's watchable only for those fans of kim or lemon . i do not count myself as being one of those fans . "
115,"the film was shot on the rugged , isolated terrain of the isle of man , which added to the film's bleakness . this drawn-out tragic love story manages to get at the characters it highlights , though what it uncovers is more obvious than startling or insightful . it was a thoroughly uncomfortable but poignant scene , shot in mostly brown and yellow coloring . he is without regard for culture or books . the script provides no plausible explanation for all the confusion going on in her head . it seemed to be a no-brainer which one to choose . it was obvious from the get-go that harry wasn't for her , therefore the film lacked tension in her choice of who to be with . this film reminded me of a thomas hardy type of novel that was written by someone who didn't have the writer's obvious talents and has come up with a story that mostly captures the stark atmosphere of the rural community but does not put a proper perspective on the psychology of the characters . "
116,"this film is worth seeing for those who want to see what mick jagger looks like when sporting an abe lincoln beard . but he fails to be convincing , in my opinion he is better suited to play gene kelly than ned kelly . this was a flat presentation , hardly touching an emotional button on what all the fuss was about over ned kelly's call for justice . jagger didn't have a prayer in succeeding in this dry script offered by ian jones and tony richardson . the story failed to focus on australia , seemingly a more british film than australian . if you want to see a better film about ned kelly , catch "" mad dog morgan "" ( 76 ) , a much truer and more daring version , with dennis hopper giving a much better characterization of ned kelly's madness , something this film could only do in a ho-hum manner . "
117,"the film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities . the result is merely an academic exercise , leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldn't build on to show them as the poets they were . on paper , this shouldn't have been so terrible -- it had a talented director in agnieszka holland ( "" the secret garden "" ) , a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton ( dangerous liaisons ) , and a capable cast . but the film was done in by its inept script , the unappealing way the film was directed , and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud . i found his performance to be the most risible one in the film , with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius , spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade . he , especially , looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin a character he was forced to be . the hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail and that was not very satisfying . the film ends on a whimper . . . with this film was especially annoying because rimbaud's poems are filled with a visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film , as the film only manages to skim the surface of the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their poetry . i have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film , but whatever it was , it just didn't work . it certainly didn't bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the so-called father of modern poetry . "
118,"a terribly unreal end of the world film , even though it is laced in the everyday world of a family drama . it's a thriller stressing supernatural shocks and fuzzy apocalypse dramatizations , that has the cast trying hard to be convincing about all the hokum presented of bloody rivers in nicaragua , dead fish in haiti as the sea boils , of birds falling from the sky , the earth shaking , ice in the israeli desert in the same place as sodom , and hailstones on fairfax ave . if i said hard to believe , i really mean this film was so ludicrous , that it was impossible to believe . the film was so dreadfully out of touch with its own story , that it kept piling on different situations which only made its far-out story even more implausible . lack of clarity became the only clear thing about the film . the film lacked a decent script , meaningful acting , and credible direction . it is a silly film -- but not one that was funny in a campy way . the film's moral message that the world can be saved with hope , seemed like mush . "
119,"a poorly made thriller , reeking from conventionality and lacking real suspense . it is played as a revenge film about a framed housewife who aims to get even with her slimy husband , but on the way to the film's payoff , the action is dull and unconvincing . all the characters are emotionally uninvolving . the script was lifeless and everything about the story seemed contrived , not to mention that there were huge holes in the plot . she looked so dolled up and refreshed , that it was hard to believe she was not at a country club , and those jailbird ladies getting her hip to doing underhanded things , like running traces on missing people , weren't just the sweetest dolls in the world . i felt as if i was watching a movie done by the numbers , as it plodded through every scene as if the film was being made for a film school class , while the film seemed alive only in its moments of action . the film makes a big deal about this in its plot , but when it comes time to have the payoff go that way , it chicken outs to convention and ends its story in the usual way tv crime stories end . in conventional films like this one , someone who rails against the common man's lack of art knowledge , deserves to be cast as the villain . the story made little sense , but if you are looking for some bright spot in the film , try the quaint new orleans cemetery as a pivotal background setting that helped magnify the suspense of the story . that location scene is all i enjoyed about this rather trivial and commercially made suspense film . no viewer should mistake it for a hitchcock and have to receive a scolding for that mistake by some film critic snob . "
120,"the comedy is played more in comic strip style for entertaining value than for deeper satire , as it features mostly zany sophomoric sight gags and relies heavily on special effects . that's the big joke in the film and the novelty of that cannibalism idea wears thin mighty fast , as the characters are too absurd and sketched too thinly for us to care about them . this tasteless postapocalyptic french comedy is a first feature for the co-directors marc caro/jean-pierre jeunet . it failed to reach my funny bone and instead left me mostly annoyed at its slight story and its dark projections for the future . the entire film takes place in the shabby tenement , and the tenants are an odd lot of bizarre malcontents , who do not trust each other . the directors overloaded the film with too many eccentrics , as the comedy seemed forced while the surreal look of the film added no dramatic intensity . delicatessen could have some appeal to the cult film crowd who like their meat sliced thin , monty python fans , and those who liked terry gilliam's brazil , a film similar in spirit . "
121,"it is mostly the pimps who do the talking for their ho's , and the egotistical and flamboyant way you would expect them to be , is what you get . it makes for a film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say , but if one has a sense a humor for what their lifestyle is about , then some of what they rap about might seem amusing . this sleazy pic , soon became grating and wore out its welcome to my unreceptive ears . also used as reference , was iceberg slim's best-seller pimp , the story of my life . these dudes needed no prompting to talk , as they just love to brag about about themselves . so ho's need pimps . '' the film was all about pimp style and their projected image , as they run a hard-sell riff about the virtues of their work . there are different styles of pimping , but the film mentions them only as being "" macks "" and "" players "" or "" real pimps "" and "" perpetrator pimps , "" but no further clarity is attempted . the film could never get to the core of what makes the pimp think in such a perverted way as he does , as the filmmakers were taking for a ride by the pimps , who were looking only to pose in front of the camera and say their thing , hungry for their 15-minutes of fame . the only laughs i got out of this bleak look at an american subculture , was hearing how a few pimps retired and what they are now up to . "
122,"this is a poorly directed and scripted derivative casino heist movie , shamelessly stealing jokes , plot situations and shootout scenarios from many other such films , including "" ocean's 11 , "" "" honeymoon in vegas , "" "" the limey , "" and "" reindeer games . "" all the main characters are unappealing , even the young boy can't get over as someone appealing . but the most disheartening thing about this irrelevant flick , was its unethical conclusion and its totally amoral characterization of the film's stars . there is not one person worth too much in this motley crew of lowlifes . the only lame joke that made me laugh , was when one gang member asked , what's the advantage of dating a homeless woman ? the answer is , you can drop her off anywhere . this film is so ridiculous , that as one of the cynical fbi men wisecracks , after learning about murphy's rap sheet , "" you can't make stuff like this up . "" unfortunately the screenwriters lichtenstein and recco did , which makes for a particularly distasteful film . the only thing the film has going for it , is that the situation and the characters are so ludicrous and full of elvis twitches , that there is certain kind of enjoyment to be found in a film as bad as this one is -- that might be taken by some as a guilty pleasure . "
123,"the gimmicky premise grabs your attention , but the film fails to maintain its suspense as the story line becomes increasingly more absurd . why the nondescript , everyman character played by depp , would believe that walken wouldn't kill his daughter anyway , even if he did kill the governor , is just one of the major flaws in this ridiculous premise . if you buy into the story line , then you should find the film suspenseful in the hitchcock style . if you don't , the only consolation is that the acting was good . as far as i'm concerned , it was a preposterous premise and even if believed , the plan was far too risky and complicated for those involved , and there is no way the high insiders in the governor's camp wouldn't have come up with another plan to use , like the usual one of a professional assassin with a high-powered rifle . the only surprise the film could have for me , is if both depp's daughter and the governor were killed . this unnotable suspense yarn , brings little to the table and concludes with an unsatisfying ending -- which was more silly than tense . director john badham ( "" saturday night fever''/ "" stakeout'' ) tells the story effectively in real time , which makes it a watchable though forgettable film . "
124,"steal this movie ! it meant well , showing the charismatic abby in the best possible light as the '60s prankster symbol of anarchistic , ecstatic , anti-establishment revolution , but this clich ? biopic failed to be emotionally involving , it had no craziness to it . . . and . . . its false sense of piety to its subject ruined the whole point of the film . i read hoffman's steal this book ! the film , adapted from two books -- abbie and anita hoffman's "" to america with love : letters from the underground "" and marty jezer's "" abbie hoffman : american rebel , "" was two goody-goody in its approach to capture either the mood of the changing times or the manic-depressive mood swings of the unabashed publicity hound , who thought of himself as a hippie organizer . admittedly , making a film about the '60s ( in this film abbie's starry-eyed days were between 1967-70 ) is not easy to do because of the problem of making a satire about what was a satire to begin with , but this film was so poorly scripted , directed and acted , that it is worst than most films about that era . d'onofrio who is a big man does not physically resemble the much smaller hoffman and his odd boston accent sounded artificial . he does bring an energy to the role , but it seems misplaced as he seems to have made the one thing abbie had going for him , a real sense for comedy and wit , seem nonexistent , as the script is so self-serving to him and his lawyer , that it made the whole project stink . the only thing d'onofrio does well , is try and steal this movie for himself . all the other roles were flatly played and had no impact on the film . "
125,"this film , a roger corman exploitation b-film , is a relic of the 1960s and its only value might be in helping sociologists discover what went wrong with that era's visions of universal love . it's a good trip as opposed to a bad trip movie , scripted by none other than jack nicholson . it sugar coats the acid experience and promotes it as if it was a commercial for a product seen on tv . the film itself was a trip in visual clich ? s . it was also comical without trying to be , as i lost count of how many significant groovies , man , and wows were said . the result is a film that looks and feels stilted and untrue . it should be an embarrassment for those who participated in it , because of its fake sixties hipsterisms . well , there you are , that's the film's plot and its resolution . bruce dern acts as a guru for fonda's initiation into lsd , telling him "" i'm gonna be here , man , trust me . "" soon fonda is saying things like everything is alive , i feel energized -- i'm into some beautiful stuff . none of his acid experiences seemed to be anything but trivial and hedonistic ones ; the scene in the laundrymat was the only one that made me laugh . this aip cheapie looked cheap , as even the garish visuals -- which should have been super , were flat and mind-bending in the wrong way . there was nothing on this trip worth seeing . it offers a false sense of nostalgia for those who were into acid , and for others , they should get a good laugh at the expense of someone else's unintentionally bad film . "
126,"this is also shown to be the prevailing opinion of every other coal miner in town--that it's something only for the lassies to do . this was the most energetic scene in the film and the only one that kept me fully awake , as the kid convinced me he could dance with pep . "
127,"it's an old-fashioned type of film , that has the main characters talking in phony polish accents and throwing out schmaltzy dialogue at will , as it suffers so much from being poorly scripted . there must have been a reason why neophyte director/writer theresa connelly made this film into a nostalgia story that wants to look like it was made in the 1950s , i just wish she included that reason as part of the storytelling and dropped all those clich ? s to explain every situation . in the realm of movies that try so hard to please its audience , this one almost begs for audience approval , but the only thing that should please the crowd is the sex appeal of the beautiful looking ensemble cast . i'm sure there could have been some comedy over this , but the film was so flat , it couldn't draw out the comedy or any worthwhile observation about this zany situation . it didn't work for me , i got no warm and fuzzy feeling for this working-class family . it was a film of many vignettes , all coming together with the themes of family values , sex , and religion , but none of the themes is brought to any fruition where it could register with any credibility . "
128,"a film that could have been an interesting study about a cold-blooded hit man , but instead ends up without much to say that isn't banal . what it best offers is a colorful but artificial touristy look at spain and belgium . the remainder of the supporting cast has little to do . the script by s . lee pogostin is a weak one , as is his original screenplay , as is his flat way of directing . the film belabors its point about how violence is killing the world and preaches to a snoozing audience how love can soften even the coldest of individuals . he wears dark sunglasses and has a cane , which would indicate blindness , but his part is so underwritten , that he's not explained at all , he's just around to be part of the scenery . sterling says : "" murder is like going through a tunnel , once you go through it you have gone past it . "" this should have been a noir film , one with a different cast , script , director , and cinematographer . just about everything about this film is wrong . "
129,"this is a ridiculous film . if you think about it , it just doesn't make sense . it's a tale about wishy-washy "" humanitarianism . "" that is something i just find hard to believe always happens ( opinions often change , but people ( principles ) do not ) . it's a manipulative film and if you go with the flow of the story and accept the logic presented , then everything is manufactured to make you eschew reason and be persuaded by your blind emotional responses . this is a middle-brow art film and even though it pretends to offer more , it doesn't . it should only serve those who go to films to be entertained in the way a vacuous hollywood film does , where the viewer is expected not to care how ridiculous the story is . what this film is best at doing , is having its star actors look good and have a cinematographer , like eduardo sarra ( leconte himself did a lot of the filming ) , make a static film look stimulating by beautifully photographing it . these are diversionary tactics that can easily lull one into just going into a slumber and accepting this contrived film at face value without giving it a further thought . patrice leconte ( "" ridicule "" ) latest film "" the widow of st . pierre "" is particularly annoying because it is so smug . it is a film that stacks the deck in the murderer's favor and could care less about the murder victim . if the film's aim is to make a case against capital punishment , it succeeds only in making a case for phony compassion . i'm afraid the filmmaker's aims are just to make a movie pushing its star cast into appealing fantasy roles and sucking the viewer into believing the film is serious in tackling tough issues because the stars are taking their roles in a serious manner . its moral high ground against capital punishment was not only unconvincing , but it leaves a bitter feeling in the air . do-gooders generally manage to do more harm than good , and that will prove itself in this film as well . the widow of saint-pierre is juliette binoche ( in my book , she's the julia roberts of french movies , matching the american in superficial acting techniques ) . it might be of interest to note , that guillotine is a slang word for "" widow "" in french . basically , this is a bourgeois story about the self-righteous couple wallowing in their comfort and materialism and self-aggrandizing powers . his blank look at his situation is probably what the director expects from his ideal movie viewer . this is a visually pleasing film ; it has nothing more to offer than a make believe tale about real issues and concerns that the film can't get to because of its own arrogance in filmmaking . "
130,"a good spoof on the church , but it is ruined by its vulgarity , excesses and absurdity . the ensemble cast is made up of many stars in cameo roles , but that does not guarantee that the acting is good . even if there was no controversy , this film is too weird and too poorly put together to deserve a theater release . the film is a series of sight gags , nasty one-liners , pronouncements against the church , and awkward comic scenes . most of it is inane , but one of its good moments is when it is said : a good reason for keeping the hand as a miracle , is that it gives people a religious belief in the hereafter and because of that they would be nicer to each other . it is directed with reckless abandon by alfonso arau ( like water for chocolate/a walk in the clouds ) , with a disarming heavy-handedness and lack of subtlety ( it ends by this in-your-face statement : god is sending a message , if you can't take a joke , go f * ck yourself ) . it's a strictly for the pits film , but it did get in a few good body punches on the church . the one i liked best is : if jesus wasn't killed , you wouldn't have a religion . "
131,"a mindless film noir set in arizona . the film it resembles most is "" bad lieutenant "" ( 1992 ) . in imitation of pulp fiction , there's lots of frivolous talk . it's a film liotta saw a 100 times . harry is a good guy with an honorable code of ethics and would be fine , if his gambling habit didn't make him so twisted . the film has nothing to say that makes sense , the acting was forgettable , the dialogue was trite , and all the characters seemed to be out to lunch . it's a film that will not rise from it's ashes . "
132,"open secret is a quality story , but is a cheaply produced b-film with similar themes about anti-semitism as "" crossfire "" and "" gentleman's agreement . "" this is one of the rare occasions that leonard played a cop instead of a gangster . the story should hold your interest . "
133,"a dull and oppressingly long three-hour ode to the glory of war and killing . this strictly commercial film's budget was for $135 million and uses as its model for financial success "" titanic "" and its anti-historical way of telling its historical story . it's a film made for the huge crowds it hopes to pull in , by giving them all the goo they could possibly ingest in one sitting . it ran a clich ? romance story for two hours worth of the film and after 80 minutes of this corny love story , the japanese at last attack pearl harbor and the film to its credit accurately gets the chaos of the events right ( the only thing it got right in the film ) . this invasion was the heart of the film and lasted for about 40 minutes ; it got its money's worth in good airplane battle footage from the computer-generated imagery ( though the scene itself had a flatness that made it appear uninvolving but competenly done ; there was no emotional resonance to any of the action ; it was respected for its technical achievement rather than for being artistic ) . for the last third of the film you could have skipped out and missed nothing , because it went back to that annoying love story it was hammering out . every thing about this film was second rate ; especially , when compared to modern war films such as "" saving private ryan . "" the trite dialogue , inept script , misuse of history , irritating character portrayals , the soapy background music , and the clanky acting by everyone concerned , made this overlong work into a critical bomb . every character was a stock character seen in many other hollywood films . i couldn't help myself from laughing , it was such a silly attempt at patriotism . that's about as deep as we get into their characters . kate has fine features and virtuous good looks , and an empty expression that is the same both for love of rafe and of country . the film plays it safe and lays no blame on why pearl harbor was so unprotected . no character in the film had any shading or depth , everyone was a forgettable personality . the one-dimensional characters just say their lines and the film keeps moving along . though this film failed in every which way to provide a history lesson , or an engaging story , or be an entertaining film ; still i'm afraid it will have box-office success . it reduced everything to the lowest commom denominator by the crass bruckheimer rules for commercial success ( keep the dialogue banal and down to the film's theme , and keep everything in motion so no ideas could get in the way of the mindless violence on the screen ; this way it remains on a fourth grade level and can be easily understood by the masses ) . it would be difficult to make a film more shallow than this one ; but , i'm cynically looking forward to bay and bruckheimer teaming up again , i think they have the potential to stoop lower than they have so far ( because as bad as this film was , it could have been worst ) . "
134,"i'm not an admirer of philip kaufman's ( the unbearable lightness of being ) previous films . in quills he has adapted doug wright's play to create a drab period piece of the marquis de sade story . it lacks an edginess , as the shocks against civilization's sensibility are not geared to move the intellect . its theme embellished the belief that freedom is in writing without censorship . the film's rallying cry could be , 'bring me a quill ! ' it was a time of mixed messages in the areas of social reform and repression . kaufman shot this dreary tale at pinewood studios and used mostly an english cast , though some cast members were australian and american . in this version , the marquis de sade is made out to be more of a misguided writer and a witty aristocrat than truly a murderous villain . there are many quotes from his writings , but not those that show him in his more beastly nature . royer-collard is reduced to be more the villain than the marquis is . he has the most solid role in the film and makes the best of it . kate winslet didn't convince me she was a peasant laundress , but she still came off with a feisty although a forgettable performance . the film failed because it was too dull to be entertaining and it didn't have anything startling to say about a startling subject to be intellectual . its shrill moments outweighed its moments of irony , when it was able to show how insane the men of reason were in their treatment of the mentally ill . this was a middlebrow work , that made light of the innovative marquis as a man who was merely politically incorrect rather than completely debased . aiming at those targets is like shooting at ducks in a pond . "
135,"you'll need some kind of a pill to sit through this soap opera piece of dreck . become recognized as the ultimate in trash pics . it's a film mired in banality and in a risible dialogue . but broadway doesn't go for booze and dope - now get out of my way , i've got a man waiting for me . "" another sample of the film's trite dialogue goes like this : agent : it's a rotten business . neely : "" but i love it . "" this clich ? -ridden film is as bad as these types of films ever get . but some have embraced it for its campiness . suit yourself ! i can't see a fan of hollywood films ignoring an infamous classic pic like this one forever . it is interesting to note , that all the men the girls become associated with are either : gay , sick , cheats , mean to them , or just plain wimps . that's showbiz i guess , according to the valley of the dolls . you should love the pic's bad acting by everyone except hayward . "
136,"this is a tense hostage-gangster film set in the 1940s , so the hoods wear fedoras and business suits . it seems more like a play than a film , and that is not surprising since it was originally a play . his bleeding-heart liberal attitude is not thought of much at present but in this film it seems to be the voice of reason , as if criminal behavior can be explained away by a bad environment and by getting counseling when in trouble . it's all pop psychology , but the actors are so serious about it that it's amusing to hear them say their lines with a straight face . so i guess the shrink knew what he was doing ! this is pure hollywood hokum . though , it is well-acted and is watchable . "
137,"former hal hartley actress adrienne shelly directs her second feature , a low budget indie about a blind date gone bad . it's a romantic comedy which manages to show a lot of grief over the loss of a loved one . there's no bill pullman in this film so pullman clone , reg rogers , plays the main role of the dumped husband . this will turn out to be a shrill role for sheedy , who never seems like a real person . bernice talks a mile a minute and the disinterested sad sack bill finally gets a word in and nastily tells her "" you're ordinary and pathetic . "" i found this scene to be particularly dull and wondered why it was so scripted that bernice had to be told her granny had a lover by max and wouldn't have already have known about it , that is if she was such a caring grandchild as the film wanted her to be portrayed as . the film's quirky resolution comes at the point of a gun or two . it makes some point about getting to know the one you fall in love with . since i didn't find much comedy here ( only a lot of silliness ) and wasn't taken in with the characters or their troubles , i merely went along for the bumpy ride and tried not to wince too much at the forced comedy situations . this film could have used hartley's magical cinematic touch big time and a tighter script if it was going to take me somewhere i hadn't been before . "
138,"a bleak indie film about a stolen identity . there's not much more to this visually stylish film than what meets the eye , as it relies on shock to tell its story of a prolonged vicious mugging . it falls into the category of being a pretentious art-house film , leaving a bitter taste in one's mouth as it stereotypes its characters and unintentionally further inflames the racial issues . but the story is so filled with violence and its nyc setting looks like hell , that it's hard to enjoy this film and to follow what the logic in the story is supposed to mean . the film works best as a visually challenging piece , as each shot looks like a photograph carefully telling the story unfolding . the film is stuck with a clumsy dialogue and an overuse of symbolism , as it ends with nothing more to tell after the shock and the violent situation it created except to beat it into the ground . it could only be commended for how appealing the film looks , as if it's a scrapbook of still photos put together to celebrate a mugging . "
139,"the film is filled with violence , vulgar dialogue , and seems devoid of real feelings . it relies on twists in the plot to keep you tuned into the investigation and shocking scenes to keep you aghast at the horrors of being in vietnam . the acting was flat , the story was trite , and the suspense was marginal . "
140,"an old-fashioned "" jock "" flick , notwithstanding that all the basketball players are white and the game seemed played in slo-mo . this one plays as a moralistic tale about the temptations placed before young athletes , and how the hook goes into them making them succumb to fix games . everything about the story is obvious , and it ends as predictably as it begins . it plays like an old newsreel piece ; a study of a different era that has little relevancy for today . it was second-rate as far as acting and the story line had the stench of a locker room smell all over its reels . "
141,"this is not one of the filmmaker's better comedies , it seems too preachy in trying to convince us of how sex and love go together like politics and politicians . it was all ho-hum . . . who cares , as the characters could never be seen as real people and the action was dull and ridiculous . at one point in the film , a character is offered the choice of hearing barry white or vivaldi -- and -- without a hesitation chooses white . i would have chosen vivaldi , but barry white songs are played throughout , thereafter , and in my opinion were the most lively thing about this film . the film is set in lyon , where we are told there is a large unemployment problem and because of that men seek pleasure from prostitutes more than they do in good times . the belabored point made is , what a joy sex is . blier just didn't take this story anywhere , even the elegant charms of the very ladylike whore , grinberg , soon loses its appeal . i grew weary trying to follow blier's logic , and what he had to say didn't seem to add up ; i wasn't laughing at any of his satires . it turned into sentimental tv sitcom stuff instead of following through on the theme of all the sexual alienation there is in society , a theme it quickly jettisoned for no discernible reason by following the pimp around instead of the whore ; especially , since it had nothing else to say that mattered . "
142,"it is a pretentious arty film set in 1929 , which failed to be credible or involving . the story was emotionally flat and the contrived ending was ludicrous ( this was not the same ending in the novel ) . dalloway ) tried to say in this merchant-ivory styled literary film . it was a drawn out glossy affair stuffed with empty gestures to the arts , and i could never figure out what john turturro was trying to do with his role as the chess genius , who is both a social misfit and someone who is mentally unstable , except to ham it up by acting over-the-edge . there just never seemed to be any point or excitement to this film , as adapted by screenwriter peter berry from vladimir nabokov's ironic novel . this film is devoid of nabkov's wit and irony , it reminded me only of a film that was concerned with showing a pretty face , some pretty scenery to look at , and eschewing any controversy . the film was devoid of any fascist's presence , even though mussolini had come to power in the early part of the 1920s , so even the period film's background history is distorted . these flashbacks were an attempt at making crass amateur psychological explanations for luzhin's emotional unstability due to his wretched upbringing . these scenes are conventional and added little meaning to luzhin's personal dilemma . everything about luzhin seems heavy-handed and done only for effect and not to develop his character . whatever happens to him seemed overwrought and artificial . his over-acting and the way the film tried to make this unfeeling love affair into a real one , had a disingenous feel to it . this film felt heavy at all times , like it was load of manure being dumped on a story that deserved a better fate than this film was able to give it . "
143,"these aliens avoid the light and strike when it's dark . this sci-fi formula action flick is noteworthy for its splendid cinematography , as it was filmed in the australian outback , and for its innovative editing cuts . the story line left me gasping for more light and the acting left me in the dark searching for one line of dialogue that wasn't shrill or trite . no actor was provided with a challenging part , but diesel uses his powerfully muscular presence and deep baritone voice to dominate this action story . he comes to say one-liners such as this : "" they did not know who they were f * cking with ! "" he says this to the dead aliens after he puts them out of their misery , but he might as well have spoken it to a dead audience . the writer/director david twohy ( the arrival ) tries to bring some intelligence to the story , but the script is too predictable to keep one interested in it . the characters ranged from a shrill radha to a cartoonlike diesel , making it easy to root for the aliens to possibly , against all formula film odds , pick off all the survivors of the spacecraft . but three do survive and , in my opinion , that's three too many ! this film didn't have a clue about what point it wanted to make . it was particularly unclear how good or bad they wanted to portray diesel's character , as he kept changing from bad to good guy at every alien sighting . by the film's end i had an empty feeling , knowing i saw another special effect sci-fi film that couldn't bring on a story . "
144,"a far-fetched thriller that bogs done in an incredible situation by the film's last 20 minutes . there's something dry about her performance . there's also the lack of chemistry in the relationship she has with the spader character . this was not a very satisfying thriller : it lacked conviction , memorable performances , and intelligent dialogue . an example of the film's inane dialogue can best be heard in a typical conversation between the two protagonists . spader : you're a psychopath . amick : even psychopaths can still love somebody . this kind of talk might be especially appealing to the psychopaths in the audience . there weren't many layers to peel away from this story before discovering how manipulative it was , how it was without a strong actor's presence , and how it failed to make a strong psychological imprint ; the characters were made into objects of a contrived tale causing the film to lag . "
145,"leatrice is also responsible for popularizing the bobbed hair look , which was the style of her hair for this film . this is fluff romantic/comedy that has many holes in the story ; this makes the film lacking in certain basic standards of filmmaking . it's also reflective of the 1920s male chauvinistic attitude toward women , where it can be said with a straight face by one of the main lady characters : "" that a man wants beauty not brains in a woman . "" and aren't you wonderful ! when he demonstrates the machine , doolittle sneakily fixes it so it splatters over all those watching the demo . it's also beyond me how the family could invite someone as devious as that into their home . but , in any case , the brainy a . b . that seems to be the way a 'feel good' movie went in those days , as it leaves the audience with a happy feeling . this same formula is still used by the hollywood film , but the film's are much more polished today . the clinging vine is not a good film by any stretch of the imagination , but it does present an historical perspective of those silent era times . "
146,a ponderous melodrama that even becomes more awkward by the film's end . the doctor prescribes for her a powerful pain-killing pill that is fatal if more than one is taken within an hour . 
147,"a fluff sitcom , romantic comedy , that is so charming that it eventually suffocates on all the charm it gives off . it is cleverly written and directed by irish playwright gerard sternbridge , who can't stop showing off how clever he is able to make his main character . the film was shot almost a year before "" almost famous "" made kate hudson into a celebrity , and a golden globe winner and oscar nominee for best supporting actress . in any case , kate does a flawless irish accent . he's a bullshit artist extraordinaire , with an easy manner about him , who cunningly knows how to reach out to women , which was mildly satisfactory for about 45 minutes of the film but after that became annoying . his gracious smile soon looked too smug and unbecoming , as the story had no particular meaning to it and i have seen too many recent films with studs in it to care how this silly story resolved itself . this film resolved itself in the cute way the story was heading , a 'feel good' film for those with an amoral bent and a belief that having sex with as many women as possible is the best thing one can do to improve relationships . for all the main characters there's a voice-over used to spell out their thoughts and also captions of their thoughts are at times flashed onscreen . scenes are also repeated so we get reactions from different individuals . the film's main purpose seems to be in showing what a likable rake adam is -- that he is willing to meet the needs of whomever he's with . he proves that having secrets in a relationship can add spice to it and make it an even more serene and lasting one . this is contrasted with adam being shown by the film's end as a pathological liar and an uncaring sexist . the film's image of him left me confused about what i was supposed to think of him . but my gut reaction is , i had a belly full of this guy long before the film ended and therefore found this vacuous story unsatisfying . it was like i was being asked to overlook adam's failings and be won over by his obviously trite charms . i wasn't and therefore didn't care for adam , or the film , or did i particularly care for any of the sisters . the only thing i liked in the film was the jaguar , and i didn't care how adam got it or what story he told about how he got it . that was supposed to be funny and show that he might have some problems with telling the truth . "
148,"a poorly crafted revenge action film , that seems to be satisfied with itself for being so muddled and image conscious . gonin is a slickly done visual treat in bizarre behavior and violence , with homoerotic overtones . this is a nonstop action flick styled after those recent hong kong action films of john woo , ringo lam , and tsui hark . since i'm not a fan of the originators of this genre , i'm especially not partial to their imitators . "" gonin , "" which means 'the five , ' is devoid of character development and a coherent story , or anything but mindless blood-and-gore and an outpouring of jump-cuts and fast editing . but even with all those filmmaking tricks of the trade , the action scenes seem like they're in slo-mo when compared to the hong kong ones . the hitmen quickly locate all of them since the gang fails to cover-up their identities properly , and the film becomes a vehicle for showy performances . the only memories from this film are of the gruesome kind , as killing is the thing here and director ishii--who used to illustrate manga--hyperrealistic , action-packed japanese comics--goes all the way with this theme by making it into a cartoonlike story . there's definetly an audience for this type of cultish film , except don't count me as one of those happy viewers . i prefer my violent flicks to make a little more sense and have at least some character development . tarantino's reservoir dogs looks like a shakespearian classic compared to this b-film , one that hopes to get by with its all-star cast and the menacing performance by the indomitable takeshi "" beat "" kitano . "
149,"it's a love it or hate it film . i simply hated it . on its menu for fun , is a violent feast served up as charm and done in a tongue-and-cheek manner . it's a serial killer/horror film farce of nonstop over-the-top action and sleaze , involving decapitations , vampires , biker fights , extended gun play , and an array of gore that has to be seen to be believed . a film that regales in its vulgarity and campiness for blood-and-gore , as it goes out of its way to gloss over the clich ? s of the conventional b-films . it's geared only for the cult film crowd , and will make its mark there one way or the other . these scenes are all done with an eye for comedy and parody , if that's possible . it's not explained how he happens to be chinese . the place is open from dawn to dusk , thus the film's title . here's where rodriguez has a chance to throw convention out the window and have some absurd fun , as the place turns out to be a vampire hangout . this supposedly clever script did nothing but turn me off , though there were a few funny moments in a film that was dripping with special effects and spent most of its script in finding novel ways to showcase its killings . i'll take a pass on this one , it's just not my style of a film . the characters were as empty as the story , and the film was an easy one to forget . "
150,"a film that means well , but is too pushy in promoting its belabored point and too sentimental to be compelling as a drama . the film is done in by its ham-fisted script as the story , adapted from carl friedman's book "" the shovel and the loom , "" goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality . the effort seemed heavy-handed , as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters . the supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a cartoonish flavoring : chaja's parents are given no human shades , while the janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was one-dimensional and falsely acted . the only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser , whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt -- but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots ; while rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence , but is strong in accepting her faith . topol's reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser , acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense . i felt i didn't just see a movie , but i attended a lecture for the whole 100 minutes of this serious but unappetizing story . it was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon , as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarily--the message it keeps sending was already received . that seems strange , since i thought that was what this film was supposed to be about . unless i was mistaken and the film's real aim was to make us cry over simcha . "
151,"the film is a muddled effort to make them into hero and heroine , and the effort to do that seemed to misfire somewhere in the long sea journey home for wayne . why this is so , sure beats me . napier fires on the freighter and destroys it . the film ends in mystery , as it is not certain if ehrlich and elsa escaped or were killed . as for me , i could care less--this was one of the duke's poorer films . it was a tedious chase and an irrelevant story , and the dialogue was just atrocious . this letterboxed version was watchable only to see how lana acts while wearing furs , evening dresses , and tight sweaters aboard the freighter . "
152,"one of chabrol's weaker films . there wasn't much magic in the magic show he put on . the video version i saw was badly dubbed in english and showed tunisian subtitles . it's a b-mystery story that engages the occult for its plot , as it asks you to believe that there are clairvoyants who could see what is pre-destined . the magician is certain that sylvia is doomed . chabrol is having some fun spoofing the conventions of magic and the rationality of science , and how the idle rich have nothing to do in this world but make trouble . the story was slight , the suspense was not earth shattering , and it resulted in film that hardly mattered . "
153,"a sophomoric action comedy with a distinctive australian flavor , relying on screw ups to provide the comic situations . should appeal to teenagers and to those who think like them , and for those who just like a madcap film and don't concern themselves with plot and character development . i'll give the film credit for having a lot of pep and for being quirky . it's much like ritchie's "" lock , stock and two smoking barrels , "" as its humor is of the physical kind equally mixing a crime caper story with dumb or , if you prefer , black comedy . the film doesn't know how to gracefully end , but it does end on an a too cutely done amoral note . this comes after a few more plot twists . it was shown at the sundance film festival of 1999 . it was a harmless entertainment venture , of limited value . it's one of many recent world-wide films about combining comedy in a urban crime pic , though a new type of pic for the aussies . this one is forgettable , but somewhat likable because of the lead characters . "
154,"ladd speaks in a laconic monotone voice , while jones is shrill and unappealing . besides the dullness of the story , it seemed far-fetched . it seemed as if the film ran out of oxygen and just wanted to end . vickey is warm to him , but the others treat him with disrespect . the drama never had much of an impact , and the story seemed silly and misplaced . it over sentimentalized the children and made the adults into wooden caricatures of evil . ladd seemed miscast , while jones failed to be convincing in her role . "
155,"this was one of the poorer charlie chan episodes . also , the story was much too confusing , with too many characters appearing in uninteresting or unexplainable roles . there was hardly any mystery to this tale , as it barely met the minimum formula requirements for a chan episode . the film is set in paris in 1938 , just at the possible outbreak of ww11 . this mystery doesn't have much of a mystery to it , as there is nothing to guess--the 'bad guys' are plainly evident . firstly , it's unbelievable how such a moron could be given that assignment , as there seemed to be no second-in-command . marcel is plain annoying , he's not funny , and he overacts nonstop . "
156,"this b-film , directed by samuel fuller , is one that failed to work . the setup seemed so wooden , while the bourgeois villains seemed more like cartoon figures than real people . even the hero and the heroine failed to be convincing and looked more like imitations picked off the reels of other such b-films . they will rob the three counselors they despise -- mussolini , mr . desterne , and tartuffe -- and humiliate them in the same way they have been by them . this one should only be appreciated by sam fuller fans . "
157,"a slight romantic comedy with a feminist bent , but one with no edge to it . it turns out to be a conventional film filled with the usual clich ? s and stock characters of this genre . though it's a well-written and well-acted fluff piece , it still does not have too much to say that is surprising . it's made for the gentle art-house set , those who don't want something too disturbing to think about . the film looked like the usual sitcom stuff , and is plagued with the cheap set design features reserved for a tv movie . the film sagged in the middle of the story from the weight of its tedium , and eventually landed on its rear end with its unspectacular climax . the only thing that couldn't be sold , is this stiff story and tired plot line . the mystery to me , is how the lovely kate could like either man unless she was an insensitive dummy . it ends with the same results that happened to hubby number one , as its story of ambition and lust winds down in a whimper . "
158,"soul survivors , written and directed by steve carpenter , the writer of blue streak and the upcoming ocean's eleven remake , is a by-the-numbers horror movie whose only real scare comes from the sudden blast of a starter's pistol at a swim meet . even the ending explanation leaves plenty of plot holes to ponder . well , it would if the movie weren't so instantly forgettable . along the way people say trite little things to encourage the survivors . about the only reason to see soul survivors is if you are desperate for a guilty pleasure . carpenter tosses in a few erotic scenes , but ones that are in no danger of threatening his film's pg-13 rating . don't worry . they stay fully clothed at all times . this would be good advice for those who decide to see this movie . it is rated pg-13 for "" terror/violence , sexuality and some substance abuse , "" and would be acceptable for kids around 12 and up . just send me a letter with the word "" subscribe "" in the subject line . "
159,"there's not one character in this film that i felt anything for even though , i'm led to believe , i was supposed to . the film foolhardedly evokes dostoyevsky's "" crime and punishment "" as the inspiration behind this contemporary film about teen-age angst , yet leaves one with little to remind them of that except for the title . it's a story about outsiders who use violence to get what they want , as all the characters are severely dysfunctional and act goofy to make sure we know how screwed-up they are at all times . the question asked in all seriousness to sum up the film is too trivial to dignify with a serious response as it states even when a good person kills a bad person , it's still a tragedy . i don't see what's the big revelation about that , since i don't know of any sane person who doesn't realize that killing someone is a pretty serious thing . my other problem was i didn't know who was good , i just saw who was more vulnerable . i think it's rather pretentious and arbitrary to think this piece of pulp nonsense had caught the profound themes of the master russian writer . what it caught was a sleazy and exploitive look at a teen-age wasteland , and added nothing relevant to our understanding of such empty lives . that just has nothing to do with what dostoyevsky was getting at , it's just the typical trash seen in countless exploitive films . this unpleasant script by larry gross , seems to be vacuous and more annoying than anything intellectual it presents . it's a b-film that somehow thinks it could get over as an art film for the disenfranchised . when she said that , it came out of the blue and made absolutely no sense . i don't know what she found , but if she calls what she found love--then she lost me . this is one twisted pic . made all the worst because there's no fun in this nonsense uncovered . but the subject matter here is ripe for a steckler flick , as it's a shame the film wasted so much good photography techniques and good background music and some good acting improvisations on such an empty story . this film was released a year after the similar "" american beauty , "" even though it was made earlier . it therefore also suffers from being thought of as a copy of that film , even though it wasn't . "
160,"the premise of this thriller might be good , but even a great director like fritz lang and a superb cast consisting of joan bennett and michael redgrave can't save this film from its sophomoric use of freud to give the film's conclusion a pat psychological response to a serious mental disorder presented . the psychology was never convincing , the only thing convincing about this silly film noir is the moody gothic atmosphere it captured . if lang was not the director , this film could have been a real stinker . but he evokes as much suspense as you can out of such nonsense , and the visual images by the great cinematographer stanley cortez are truly remarkable . the film is worth seeing only for those reasons . but even lang himself thought this was a poor film , and he'll get no argument from me on that score . "
161,"it was shot semidocumentary style , with a sober voiceover telling of the growing juvenile delinquency problem in the film's beginning and ending on the note that it's up to the family , school , church groups . this rumble was the only thing that was remotely watchable in the film . it's amazing that a director like altman , who was to go on and have a great career in films , made such a feeble one here . the film might be of mild interest to those who desire to see how suburban white teens socialized , dated , had fights , and dealt with their parents back in the 1950s . . . . the film didn't even have good music to go with its teen story , and that includes julia lee singing her rendition of "" dirty rock boogie . "" "
162,"another red scare propaganda film from the 1950s that is hideous . it's only saving grace is that it is well-crafted through the skills of director jacques tourneur . otherwise the film is largely a bore , saddled with endless speeches from the main characters and an outdated paranoic viewpoint . it also suffers from a ludicrous ending on the steps of the lincoln memorial , where the commie racketeers get their just desserts in a ridiculously contrived setting . the finale is not suspenseful , surprising , or even interesting . but it looks good in black and white photography , and all the actors are so earnest in their roles that it makes one pause before raining on their parade . it's too bad that such a horrible script fills the screen with a witch-hunt theme that gives off a false patriotism message . this film can make you see red ! "
163,"this low-budget , inane , cheesy , message sci-fier was of such poor quality that it was laughable and entertaining in a way goofy films sometimes can be . the clunky message of the film ( the way the film presents it is clunky ) , is that all the world's nations should be working for peace and not getting into the nuclear arms race . but the invaders act to offer proof . delivering such a warning during a hockey game took my mind off the puck , but is that the proper world stage to deliver such a message ! this is a classic in bad sci-fi b-movies . highly recommended for those who understand that a film doesn't have to be good to be enjoyable . i liked it . . . mainly for its banal dialogue delivered in robotic tones ! "
164,"a convoluted minor film noir story whose main distinction is that it is one of the few filmed in color from the 1950s . the story is slight , it's implausible , is melodramatic , and has action that is violent for violent's sake . it results in a film that distances itself from the audience , as there's not one character worth caring about . but she fails to tell jansen about this . but dorothy is as nutty as a fruit cake , so he sticks with june . the most interesting thing about this flick , was the cinematography of john alton . he managed to make the superscope color have noirish shadows even though it is filmed in a hideous shade of garish colors . otherwise , there's not much else memorable about this low-budget film , except for how ordinary and inane it is . "
165,"the terror is more boring than it is scary . the film has a plot , but it is plodding and hardly seems up to being a b-movie of director roger corman's usual medium standards for such low-budget works . it's more interesting to know how the film was created in three days than to see the film . he also let a number of others direct various scenes that were not already written , which gives the film its muddled look . if that wasn't a silly enough premise and wasn't filled with so many holes in the story you could build a mountain on it , there's more hokum . there's not much to this film except for the moody scenes it sometimes creates and the gothic atmosphere conjured up ( a spooky castle with boris karloff sitting by a fireplace while attired in a regal bathrobe ) . that might be just enough to satisfy some hardcore corman and karloff fans . "
166,"a mediocre thriller that seems to be made just for a video release and not for the theater . it's entertaining in a limited way , as it plays like a conventional crime tv series drama . but it infortunately gets bogged down with a clich ? d alcoholic and despondent detective as its star , a predictable and uninvolving formula serial killer story , and plot devices that are unbelievable . but what really brings this film down , is its ludicrous ending . it can best be viewed as a laffer , in a negative sense . this triggers in him the ability to experience psychic reactions , as he starts seeing things about the crime ; and , he also notices by touching an article of clothing , that's part of the crime , he could be stimulated to see even more . harvey tells him--i see things , too . it doesn't make sense at present , but by the time this predictable story winds down it becomes evident why he was given the case over more capable detectives . the middle part of the film takes its time developing as it shows many suspects as the possible serial killer , as the film wearily builds to the finale . the action shots are of kiefer seeing the brutal crimes being committed in his mind . it's all very forgettable stuff , as the actors are going through the motions of acting and this lame script fails to develop anything interesting to say about the psychic policeman . "
167,"a lighthearted comedy farce built around a crime caper , but is mostly built around the star power of paul newman . the film misfires because of its weak script , lack of punch to its comedy , and the plot was too incredible to believe or become absorbed in . but if you're a fan of the 75-year-old sexy actor , paul newman , it must be good to see that he still looks good , can turn on the charm , and can still act with the best of them . the guards are not as alert then because there's no money collected , yet . the story itself is disappointing , but this is the kind of sexy and amoral role that fiorentino is very good at . it's somewhat pleasing and that could be enough to satisfy a certain type of audience . but if you really want my opinion , i wouldn't go two steps out of my way to see this one . "
168,"joel schumacher's modestly budgeted , gritty looking war melodrama had nothing relevant to say , only saying things that have been said in countless other vietnam war films . the clich ? d hero and the formulaic story never caught my fancy , no matter how much the director tried to make things happen . it's in the style of the first half of full metal jacket , but without the same impact . it's the tale of a soldier who won't conform to the army and by the film's end proves he's not a bad guy and can also be an excellent soldier if he wants to . there were just no surprises forthcoming , as the film seemed to be marking time until it shows him as a leader and proves himself heroic . i think that schumacher thinks because he has no stars and shot this one in a grainy 16-millimeter with a jumpy hand-held camera and with mostly natural light in dogme style , that he caught something cinema v ? rit ? . what goes with schumacher wherever , is a lot of corn . this film is just as weak in storyline as was his big commercial flick batman . what this film has going for it , is some good shots of the swampland in fort polk , louisiana , and some good performances . the movie moves along as if it were on a forced march to hanoi . there's also some liberal claptrap thrown into the storyline , which is unconvincingly done about a racist sociopath . the film heads toward its less than 'big bang' finale in tigerland with the same forced messages about war that could not only chase sluts out of a hotel room but drive film critics to the theater's popcorn vender rather than sit through this torture in its entirety . the director must receive credit for at least getting together a good cast , though i would have loved to see this one with a ed wood jr . cast . "
169,"they don't come gooier than this feel-good fluff piece without being too sugary for consumption . it's a romantic comedy that spins every formulaic device possible into overdrive to come up with its cutesy love story , missing only the presence of julia roberts and any sort of genuine passion . it plays as if it was an ad showing how the 'beautiful people' spend some quality time doing the nyc scene by taking in the waldorf astoria , bloomingdales , central park's wollman rink , and when looking up toward the skies they can even spot nyc's tallest skyscaper--the empire state building . it was all so superficial and predictable . the comedy was oooh so heavy-handed and the romance was unbearably contrived . to get in the mood for this goo , one has to find numerous coincidental situations believable even if they are not possible , which was asking too much from me . if you like a flick that's pretty to look at , has attractive leads , sells its love story like a $100 hooker sells herself at night in times square , is brainless and anti-septic , and requires no thought , then this film might be in your diet . after all she 'reasons , ' if that's a good word to use in this film review , they are both currently involved with someone else . house before a fireplace and a bunch of burning candles placed on stands at different heights in a setting that looks like it's an ad for furnishings placed in a bloomie's catalogue . can you guess if they will succeed ! the film gets comedy relief from the supporting cast . the one bit he does that saves this film for me , is write an hilarious obit for jon based on what the greeks might have said if they wrote obits for someone who died for love . he provides some laughs , except he hangs around too long in the story and begins to become tiresome . you can believe as this film does in "" fate determining one's future , "" but it does an awful job in proving its case . though , i've seen much worst romantic comedies . in this one , at least , the leads who didn't inspire me , didn't turn me completely off . which is the best i can say about this flick . "
170,"it's a film that has the promise of being a horror story but that never quite comes together , as the film plays more like a schmaltzy nostalgia piece and bland character study about an all-american child of the 1950s , bobby garfield , who is in a bland coming-of-age film . there's not much of a story here that isn't a contrivance , or dripping with goo , or heading nowhere . and he doesn't appear to be a great seer , or someone who is very sensitive because he was hurt . as the friendship grows between the boy and the stranger , we are forced to hear such banal profundities from the pen of king uttered through the lips of hopkins as : "" sometimes when you're young , you have moments of such happiness , you think you're living in someplace magical , like atlantis must have been . "" everything about this film felt loaded down with good versus evil characters , with situations that seemed manufactured and did not have any flow to them . in fact you can guess how everything will turn out because there's no real story in this failed mystery story . the film's all about a contrived atmospheric mood it sets in mystery to lead you to believe something is going on , as it hopes your imagination will be better than the author's in finishing the story . in the end hopkins' portrayal is too creepy and ambivalent to draw any conclusion about what all his inward hurt means and why he seems so strange and saddened . we never see any of the lead characters develop or really get to know them , we are only led to what they might be or what they represent . everyone seemed like a cardboard character waiting for either the "" low men "" to emerge or for another trite golden nugget of wisdom to fall from the lips of hopkins . this film isn't even good enough to be considered a middle-brow art-house film , as it's a commercial film that tries to be a little off-kilter with little to offer in the way of suspense .

171,"it seems it was in his blood to be bad . i guess these character quirks are supposed to make him somewhat appealing , or show that he has some kind of psychological failings . the film , to its credit , did not make him out to be a good guy . i think if you look objectively at this rogue , he is rotten to the core , or as voight more appropriately says , he's a scumbag . i wonder how many critics who raved about this film because of cahill's winsome mannerisms , would still like this character if he robbed them . and that is the point of this slickly done , methodical film , that makes it impossible for me to fall for the story , i just don't care what happens to him . his life story bored me . i thought of him robbing houses in a miner's helmet , being a smooth cat burglar , as merely clever filmmaking , capturing what is sort of odd to watch , as this fat guy bounces around and is so agile . it was great casting , making gleeson the lead . but i still find nothing in his story that appeals to me about him . cahill is just a scumbag , and voight was right . in fact , the film could have been more interesting if it was about voight . i found him to be the more fascinating character in the story . sometimes just being ordinary , hides so much more about a person , and voight seemed to have heavy things on his mind , that might have been more interesting than following this dead-end , obvious tale . the robberies he pulls off we have seen done countless times before on film . so all the precision planning that goes into robbing the museum of all its valuable paintings , and the chase scenes via car or scooter , were all well done , but so what ! this film's theme has been done too many times for me to be carried away by such direction . i wanted something else from this film , but i didn't get it . what i got was a masterful performance , that i can't deny , from gleeson , and a director who can be magnificent in setting a playful confrontational tone with what he had to work with and letting the camera do its job . . . if i wasn't revolted by cahill as a criminal , i would be inclined to rate this film much higher . "
172,"though , i gladly admit , i enjoyed viewing the unusual road scenes in the desolate brazilian countryside , where the people are poor , ignorant , superstitious , and craving for a religion that gives them some form of hope for their dismal lives . this former documentary film director , ably showed how religion can be as phony as the government that keeps most of the people impoverished . in any case , this was a place where tourists don't visit and films about this kind of brazil are rarely seen by a foreign audience . therefore , for me , the strongest point of the film is the documentary type of cinematography that went into the parched brazilian countryside , making the barren land throb with life . that was pure cinematic magic . a theme that has been done before , sometimes much better , as in landscape in the mist . the film emphasized the built-in misery the heroine has that made life for her to be a grind , but there seemed to be something special about her that the actress was able to bring out from her characterization that made her seem better than what she appeared to be . the beauty of this tale is not in the story itself , if there is a beauty in the tale , but in the way it affected the two main characters , dora and josue , as they eventually find something in themselves that they didn't know they had , and they learn how to deal with the bitternesss in their life . how much you like the film , depends on how believable you find the transformation that is about to take place for these characters . for me , it was too much sentimentality and an uninspiring and contrived plot that kept me from warming up to the story . that the woman being transformed from a spiteful person , who made fun of the letter writers and despised children , will become transfixed from an ugly duckling , mad at the world , to an almost angelic figure , someone capable of bringing great joy to the world , was too much for me to accept , all at once . the story turned out just too goody-goody for my taste . i do not trust films that are so contrived , there is something about them that remains phony , that good acting can only mask just so much of that phoniness . and the acting by montenegro was grand , she is the film , along with the fine cinematography , but even that , is not enough to completely overcome such a stale story . "
173,"there is no question that one has to be careful about the good taste required when making a so-called comedy film about the holocaust , not to offend those who have suffered enough already , but that proves to be no problem here , as benigni went to some jewish organizations prior to shooting the film and got their blessings for this project . besides , i don't think there are any sacred subjects that can't be touched , it is , ultimately , the quality of the film itself that counts . and if there is another reason for not disapproving offhand the film's comic handling of this horrific context , then let's bring up the example of charlie chaplin in the the great dictator , though not directly about the holocaust , nevertheless , it was a light comedic parody of "" the fuehrer "" , and it was considered by many , not only to be an appropriate film , but one of the all time great films . the later part of the assessment of that film , is in recognition of that film's tremendous power to satirize nazism . benigni's film just can't muster that same power , because it has muddled and sanitized its telling of the story too much , as well-intentioned , as he might have been in trying to tell the story , the power in the telling of it is just not there . what is there , are bits and pieces of the holocaust's human story , that is as horrific a story as any one can imagine , and offers some contribution to understanding the affects of the holocaust . what he just doesn't make clear , is that the italian fascists were part of the "" final solution . "" benigni's film offers no explanation for this . life is beautiful , is the line trotsky said , before he was about to be assassinated , serves as the rosy title for such a downbeat subject , that is played in a hearfelt and sincere manner , even though , what it offers for nazi atrocities is for the most part the mildly anti-septic kind , reminding me of stalag 17 , or hogan's heroes tv series where the nazis are pictured as cartoon buffoons . having a horse painted green , marked as a jewish horse , makes for a colorful scene and segue to elopement for guido ( benigni ) and dora ( braschi ) , but in no way begins to symbolize or explore the deep rooted hatred that would lead to a policy of genocide . to find such truths , go way beyond the scope of this comedy star vehicle , which , instead , uses this serious subject matter for benigni to contrast his charlie chaplin like routines with the threat of genocide that is ominous , while following a story line that will not try to offend anyone , probably not even the nazis , that much , especially since benigni calls this story a fable , giving him an excuse to invent what he wants for the film . let me tell you , the holocaust was no fable . but yet , because the subject matter is so deadly serious , he is , at least , able to reach a more general audience , drawn to see such a film they would have most likely not seen , but see it because of benigni's comic ability , and in the process , he has vouchsafed for them how insane the world's prejudice against jews has been , as he makes the film's efforts seem worthy enough , even if that were all this film would accomplish , that would be plenty . but i believe he does accomplish more , but he does it , by distorting history , until , in the end , he does show the horror and tragedy of the holocaust , in his own inimical way . in the first part of the film , if you did not know that benigni's guido was jewish , you certainly couldn't tell , since he just seemed like he was an eccentric , motor-mouth italian . so , in that sense , this film in a round-about way , is erasing that stereotyped prejudice some people might still have about jews being so different from others . i was not offended by seeing comedy routines take place in a concentration camp ; i also was not touched as i should have been with the gravity of the situation , due to the comic effects . and if any one in their right mind thought that by playing some silly child game in a concentration camp they could survive , i got a surprise for them , it ain't so . the book that gave me a very truthful and precisely frank look at the daily lives of those in such predicaments , is the one by the italian chemist and former concentration survivor , primo levi , whose autobiographical , "" i survived auschwitz , "" shows what it really was like in those camps . that book touched me , even more than the truest film to date that i saw about the holocaust , shoah , did . after you read that book , there can be no illusions that you are in for a game in the park when you are interred in such a camp . though the italian jews had it easier than the others brought to the camp , because they came there pretty near the end of the war and therefore were not subjected to long torturous years of suffering , nevertheless , it was a place where the survivors looked like skeletons and felt as if they were already dead . the film is really made up of two parts , each with a very different feel to it . for most of this part of the film we don't even know if he is jewish , until we see the green horse and , later on , see the sign on his bookstore saying this is a jewish place , since he seems to be in some denial mode of what is really going on around him . amid a whole bag full of slapstick jokes , which probably never go out of style , since the audience where i watched the film , howled with uncontrollable laughter at all the corny bits , leaving me to wonder why i can't muster a laugh . there must be something funny about this physical humor , after all , there is a long line of vaudeville comedians who made people laugh for generations doing those schticks . i guess , this kind of comedy is just not my cup of tea , and if others find it funny and because of it , find the film endearing , then it is just a question of differing tastes . though , quite frankly , i did think most of the bits were embarrassingly crass ; for instance , those contrived scenes where he keeps bumping into his future wife , and the switching of hats ; and , the egg- in- the- face routine , i found to be especially tedious , since i find him to be more energetic and a master of good timing than outright funny . but , i also , must say , the first part of the film was easy to watch , it seemed to have a smooth and even flow to it . it's too bad she can't act , but then again , this is basically a one man show , so really , she just becomes another one of his props , much like a leading lady in a marx bros . movie is used , as a diversion to balance their comedy routines . this material is shamelessly old hat , it is only effusive because the star is so frenetic and nimble and manipulative on screen . but there were also some clever bits , like his speech , though not original , it still hit the mark , as he pretended to be a school official , giving a talk on racial superiority to elementary students where dora teaches , using his body as an example of all his superior fascist parts , such as his belly button , which is a good fascist one . this game idea could probably work for as long as a train ride from italy to germany , but for anyone to think it could work inside the camp , that would be ludicrous on their part to think so . the jews in the camp looked so well fed , that it was hard to believe that they were in a concentration camp . everyone else said their lines in a flat monotone voice that projected bad acting and because of that , almost made a mockery out of their roles . naturally the comedy routines did not work inside the camp , except for the bit where guido translates the rules of the camp for the german guards , as he makes it seem to the kid that what he is reading are the rules for the game they are playing , as he explains that the guards are only acting mean because they are part of the game . no one laughed in the audience , but this was funny in a way that you wouldn't laugh out loud funny . some slapstick was tried , such as guido's comically high stepping walk , but that got no laughs . but mostly , for this part of the film , the emphasis became on this game he was playing for his kid's sake , his love was so great for him , that he would do anything to save his life . audiences could relate to that , and that cleverly became the focal and selling point of the film . that is primarily why this film won an oscar for best foreign film , its comedy alone would not have been enough . the film , to its ever lasting credit , was able to clearly depict jews as human beings , not as objects to be reduced to soap or buttons , more human than the nazis , who have disqualified themselves from being a civilized regime by their inhumanity . this where i think life is beautful succeeded most , is being a film that inadvertly , without probably really being fully aware of what it was doing , showed how unprepared the jews were for this tragedy by being in a state of denial . which is one of the reasons why the holocaust is such a touchy subject , and one has to be careful about how one presents it to others , lest one forgets its dire consequences . and as unbelievable as it may seem , life is beautful , somehow or other , caught an interesting aspect of the holocaust , with an original take on how passive the jews were , something few films really make a major point of , for one reason or another . did the film do enough to show the horrors of genocide ? for some people it evidently did enough to leave them beguiled by the improbable mix of comedy and a holocaust . the uniqueness and likability of this film , is that benigni exploits his comic talents to take advantage of a very difficult situation , using comedy as a weapon . but this is most definetly an example of the rewriting of history , by seeing the holocaust as if it could almost be perceived as comical and not quite real , as a fable , depending on the audience itself to know fully well what happened , where only by the very end of the film , is there a realization that something terrible has happened and a tear could be shed , does a disservice to how history and the victims of it look at it and fails to recognize how little people not directly involved with the holocaust actually know about it . there is a reason why films are popular , and that reason is that people want to see what they like on screen , they as a rule , do not like to think about things that are unpleasant to them , and this film has deftly and arbitrarily accomplished that by skimming the surface off all the horrible things they could have seen , instead , it subtly goes about its business by hiding from the audience what really happened to the jews in those camps by not showing how real their plight was . this film seemed almost like it was primarily a very personal film about a father's love for his family and his great sacrifice for them , rather than a holocaust film per se . that the world is still filled with hatred , filled with other genocide campaigns , and not filled with enough people throughout the world with enough courage to put a stop to this attitude , is as plain as day . i still think that most of the world is at a low stage of the evolutionary scale and ready to do a nazi-style thing all over , if given the chance , just check out the recent serbian-kosovo conflict for affirmation that ethnic cleansing has not gone away with the end of nazism . so what can a film do ? probably , all it can do is show what really happened , and it doesn't matter if its method is drama , comedy , or even a musical , as long as it is meaningful . i intend to be very critically tolerant of this film and say , that even though it struck me as a rather thin holocaust story , it is still a worthwhile film for those who don't want or can't handle the heavier stuff , and are not put off by the comedy . they will find , if they look hard enough and look past what miramax promoted for its own purposes so it could win the oscar , a film that is more complex than it appears at first glance . but they will also find , that it is a film that still makes it evident , that the world still is in denial of what really happened , and can only look at the holocaust in a rather superficial way , even after all these years . there is still an element of world guilt , that because of that , will so highly reward this film with honors , even if the film has shown that it cannot open up both its eyes to see how real the holocaust was . but , i guess , we should thank benigni for at least opening up one eye , and letting us see that both his film's take on the holocaust and most of the world's take on the holocaust , is still bonded by denial about how they view the holocaust , which is the same mistake the italian jews made when they denied the obvious , what was right in front of their noses , until it was too late . "
174,"the movie is very loosely adapted from soren kierkegaard's early treatise on beauty , infatuation and the power of intellectual persuasion . but the explicit sex is kept to the minimum ; instead , it uses the need to find romance as a form of irony to point out the thin line that separates love from madness . it pretends to be supportive of philosophy and its intrinsic intellectual powers that society has very little value for , but does not move the film in that direction . instead , it opts for light comedy . the chemistry is much better between sebastien and anne , a match that no one can possibly believe should be taking place , but is funny to watch as the opinionated and pushy sebastien operates his inane charm on the sophisticated and attractive older woman , until she nearly makes a complete fool of herself . with all these characters and precarious situations abounding , the movie still had a flatness to it , though , admittedly , in some spots the craziness of the characters was hilarious . the flatness is derived from some spark that is missing from the film . as for me , i wasn't taken with the main character , gregoire , and therefore , had little interest in his strange love affair and his affixation with magic . the story itself was weakened by its not being developed further . it seemed to be thrown together as if it were a series of comedy skits . the film did have a good sense of tongue-in-cheek humor , keeping it lighthearted . but for a film about a book a great philosopher wrote , not to be thoughtful , is in my humble opinion , only an example of a filmmaker trying so hard to be devilish but succeeding only in becoming vulgar in a philistine way . "
175,"e . j . an unconscionable clinker for those who are more impressed with intellect in films than with special effects , for a film costing 200 million dollars to make , while doing a dutiful job in recreating the grandeur of the ship and its ritzy atmosphere , but failing in everything else , except in the gall to think it has created a masterpiece . if there is anyone out there who stills believes there is such a thing as an unsinkable ship , you'll believe leonardo dicaprio's innocuous portrayal of an artist on board the ill-fated ship and that the soap opera story told is tantamount to a work of art . films backed by big money like this one , rarely ever go after controversy , much preferring to steer a trouble-free course , with a clever eye to the bottom line . i think any actress on board that ship could have played that part . it is hard to believe how trite and contrived this story was , and how everyone in this film had no depth of character . everyone was a wooden stereotype of what their class status was supposed to be like . what gave this film watch ability , was the way the ship was recreated down to its last details , giving one the romantic feeling that one was on the real voyage . at least , the money spent for visual effects went to some good usage . what was ultimately unforeseen , was that the weather created conditions that made it impossible to detect icebergs , which the ship rammed into at full speed . the photography was great . the costumes were terrific . the sound system was as good as it gets . everything about the special effects was first-class . if you judge a film by those standards , then you will be more than pleased with this film . if you are looking for a cruise into deeper water , then i'm afraid you boarded the wrong film , this one will only leak all over you . i waited a long time to see this film , choosing to watch it on tv and not on a big screen theater ; i have no regrets why i waited so long . by the way , i saw a night to remember ( 1958 ) , and thought that version of the titanic to be just grand , not cluttered with a trivial story , just sticking to the suspense of the historical event , which was fine and dandy by my non technical cerebral standards . "
176,"after a brilliant , stylish opening sequence , this film begins to unravel and by the time it ends , it is a misfire . cage and sinise play well off each other : sinise reserved ( just right for the part ) , cage frenetic ( over - emoting but still very effective ) . assassination taking place in the crowded boxing venue is masterfully done , and well worth the price of admission , as de palma goes crazy with his cameras offering numerous shots from all different angles of the crowd and the casino . we soon learn who the villains are , so the picture that so brilliantly set - up an interesting set of conflicts between the characters such as : loyalty , corruption , sense of duty , patriotism , and one's own personal dilemmas begins to go off in another direction , in the direction of where the film - makers think it can draw in the box office crowds , that is , it turns into a flat action movie , where things are easily predictable and we are cut off from any emotional involvement with the characters . the camera is the only star of this film . in the end , this became a very annoying picture that promised so much and only delivered what could be best described , as superficial entertainment . "
177,"this version of browning's poem is well-told and sensible , and probably a lot like he meant it to be conveyed , but somehow it looks flat on screen , like it was a b movie , and this is surprising , since demy is really a great director . but , evidently , something went terribly wrong here . the film is so flatly done , it was as if i was watching the machine-like actors go through the motions of acting out a chilling story , that when it came out on screen had lost its chills , even if the story itself remained chilling . "
178,"the stars of the film , who play a married couple , are probably playing out on screen a lot of what their married life was like before their real-life divorce . this film has both the look of a daytime tv soaper and a cheapie movie . i can't begin to explain why he does that , unless he is so arrogant and bored with life that he feels he has to do it . i found enough interest in this film to say that it is not completely without merit , but i did not think it told a crisp enough story to make it anything but one of chabrol's experimental so-so films . for the film to say , that men always ask questions and women don't , is not exactly a modern attitude to have these days , and it was unclear to me what chabrol's thinking about this really was , whether it was an ironical attitude or a stab at saying something that was so ridiculous that no one could take it seriously . chabrol has made a career out of being vague in his films , and more often than not it has worked to his benefit , but not this time . "
179,"at other times , the film drifts off into soapy sentimental territory , becoming contrived and not sure if it wants to be that honest and truthful about the bitter-sweet story it is telling . it is a movie made by ealing , a british studio , that actually used mostly a british cast , making the film seem more british than aussie . it is a film that disney could have easily made ; and , it should be noted that this film was made into a successful television sitcom . "
180,"he is self-serving , he presents here a bitter picture about romance , but he mainly pokes fun at either himself or his fictionalized-self , going through his wide range of jokebook material on jewish neurotics , that is sometimes devilishly funny , sometimes as flat as matzoh , and sometimes done in just plain bad taste . this ill-conceived film has its funny moments , if one can get through woody's hubris and his putz-like mannerisms , that have a way of zinging you , as if you were around a schmuck who couldn't stop , even for a second from being who he is . but when i have given up all hope for this muddled mish-mash to amount to anything worthwhile , the "" putz "" gets off some acidly perceptive comments that go straight to the laugh belly . so what are you gonna say ? this is a woody allen movie , it is how he operates best , and this one ranks somewhere in the middle of his oeuvre . there are many stars that have cameos , and it works out well , they just do their routines and fit right into this rambling story , especially since it is safe to say that this is not a plot driven movie , in fact , the plot is incidental to the movie , if there wasn't a plot this would still be a movie about the neurotic behavior of mr . allen . so i find it unnecessary to try and explain the plot fully , except to say that woody writes books , using material from his marriages , with the movie going back and forth between woody and his real life situation and the characters he has in his book being played by different actors , for instance richard benjamin is the woody allen character harry , but with still a different name from that of the book . all the characters in his books are thinly disguised representatives of his real life movie situation . the film is worth seeing for woody's acerbic one-liners ; such as : all religions are just clubs . tradition is the illusion of permanence . you are the opposite of a paranoid-- you actually believe that people like you . and there are numerous other wise-cracks , that hit the right spot . so what's the big deal if the story is not so hot , and woody is a selfish-lout , don't kvetch , enjoy yourself , you don't have to be a nihilist to get a few yuks from this film . "
181,"this is a time of great change and upheaval in berlin , and there is an international flavor in the air , as culture is moving in that direction . therefore there are great changes in the way people relate to others . as far as the nazis , their hatred is very apparent and very gripping across all levels of society during this time . this film takes , in my opinion , an erroneous view of their activity , soft peddling it , and stating that it was only among the lower classes that anti-semitism was prevalent , that the upper classes and the cultured classes were generally supportive of the jews . this is just not true . it is a rewriting of history that is not based on the facts . that is just ignoring the truly horrible and pervasive nazi reign of terror , that really didn't go into full blast until kristallnacht in '38 , but was certainly more wide-spread in the early 30s than what was portrayed here . it should also be noted that streicher was executed as a nazi war criminal as a result of the nuremberg trials . is a crush of people surging onstage to give them warm support and encouragement . there was something emotionally flat and unconvincing about this story , that not only rubbed me the wrong way , but made me think how apologetic the filmmaker was to the real events of history , as he tried to force feed the audience into believing so many untruths about what actually took place , that it is hard for me to say that this film made up for its distorted history lessons with its pleasing music and cabaret-like mood its splendid cinematography presented . its call for the world to be less nationalistic and more global minded , had a pleasing ring to it , but that is simply not enough to counter how tame the film appears as a whole , as the story does not dig deep enough into the real events ; and , also , the characters are only superficially dealt with , despite the terrific performances , so that the love story and all the different personality clashes seem to be glossed over , not making me feel involved with them as much as i should be . leaving me with the impression that i was seeing a good looking and sounding film , but one that did not ultimately satisfy my need to feel that germany has learned its lesson from its most pernicious period of history , as it fails to answer the question , how can such a cultured people accept the atrocities of the nazis so willingly . "
182,"another film skewed for tarantino enthusiasts , and this one is just as conversationally maddening , filled with vulgarities and street talk , but no sex . it pays to be the first one on your block to do it , because imitation is always second-hand stuff , and this film has the feel of something already done by many other copy-cats . but it was a funny movie , in a perverted way , even if the story line just didn't add up . when you hear the reason why they did this , you'll know for sure that this film doesn't make sense . this is peter o'fallon's feature film debut , as he chugs out all the slickness he could muster to make this film seem like its happening , including glittering credits that seem to be dancing on the screen . but it also could refer to the ill-advised nature of the mission the boys are on , because what they are doing is surely suicidal . his encounter with the dopey kidnappers of lisa , shows how he goes about his business , pulling the film into the gangster genre for a few minutes before going back to its satire of that genre . this is done while the boys are playing poker , and it passes for about as much wisdom as you are going to take away from this well-acted , dark comedy/suspense film , that is absolutely ridiculous , but it is entertaining as escapist-fare . there is one more priceless pearl of wisdom dished out , that i feel should be mentioned , because it highlights the confusing messages the film sends out , it was also uttered by charlie during his confinement , and for no particular reason it made me laugh aloud-- "" everybody lies : but word on the street , that's solid . "" this film is anything but solid , but it had a weird flavor to it , that sometimes seemed natural and other times forced . but the performances of walken and leary , kept me in this one , sometimes wondering what's the story with this film . "
183,"certain people just never have any luck . ( can a russian film be anything but ponderous ? ) the strength of this symbolical film , is in the way the director pavel chukhrai , is able to explicitly show the harshness of the stalin years as it infected the daily life of its citizens . the the weakness of the film , is that it is really not drama , but soap opera , that is convincingly done through the powerful persona that mashkov , a russian stage actor and romantic star of cinema , is able to evoke from his strong performance , who is cruel and capable of being loved at the same time . but the story seems contrived , it just flows too neatly together without having an energy of its own . the story is just too pat to be that effective , except as a curious look at what the russians themselves thought of stalin and how they functioned under his regime during the '50s . "
184,"mindless adventure takes hold , and the story becomes implausible and unimportant . an effort was made to provide a crisp dialogue , as mamet , was supposedly the richard weisz , who is mentioned in the credits as the story writer . it was wise of mamet for not displaying his own name . yet there is a sprinkling of good lines and humor , here and there , enough to make the film mildly diverting , if you are into watching this film for something else besides the action scenes . but despite some attempts to make this a deeper than usual actioner , frankenheimer's film is just your typical actioner . what gives it a lift and a sense of being something more than the thin story it really is , is the beautiful camera work and moody colors of the cinematography ; and , the superb acting by a very capable cast . without de niro's presence this film would have been less than a run-of-the-mill action film , despite its excellent cinematography . i also found that pryce and skarsgard stood out in their villain roles . and katrina witt was a welcome relief from all the hard action scenes . it didn't make sense ; but , then again , nothing really made sense in this film . i admired his manchurian candidate ( 62 ) and french connection 11 ( 75 ) for the raw power of their stories and their keen insights into his characters' behavior . unfortunately , this film is not of the same caliber . it fails to make us think that what is taking place is anything but absurd ; and , that is the shame of it . this once great filmmaker , in his prime , always seemed to provide us with both thoughtful and suspenseful films that had some depth to them ; while this film , is at best , only mildly diverting .

185,"film brings out a collection of philosophers to state its case ; such as , sartre , kierkegaard , nietzsche , and heidegger . this was a mistake . you are comparing apples with oranges , and the film suffers with its credibility from such an unjust comparison . in case ferrara forgot , vampires are not real but the holocaust was only too real . the film itself , does not feature much action , relying on a lot of chatter and non-communicative conversations to get its story across . she thanks them for coming , and then says , `i'd like to take a minute to share with you a little of what i've learned while studying for my doctorate . ' now that's what we were waiting for , since the film did not feel quite right up to that point . it felt better being more campy . despite the short-comings of the plot , lili taylor gives a credible performance . this thinking man's vampire movie , is a natural for the midnight cult audience , but will seem out of place in a prime time slot . christopher walken is a natural for this type of film , but has a part that might as well be nonexistent . we don't see him until the film is nearly over , and when we do see him , he doesn't do much , except drain the blood of the still-not-evolved vampire , kathy . one of the many problems with this low-budgeter , is that it couldn't tell its story without the philosophers . it needs their explanations to explain itself . the story , which could have been more interesting if developed properly , never has a chance to really express itself without being explained away in philosophical terms . all its weird subjects are brazenly brought up and we are teased with the weight of their meaning , and then we are stopped short from following through on what their implications are . for instance , the topic of free will , always a good philosophical one ; but , when kathy says it is now my will against theirs , we are not quite sure what she means by that . but what does that mean . unless this is a blatant call against pacifism , saying we have to get ready to kick ass whenever we are set-upon . the film's theme becomes , that existence itself is the search for relief from our habits , and existence is the only relief we can find from our habits that makes sense . so the question becomes , what should we do , if we can't kill what is dead . . . you and if you are faced with choosing you or them , jumping or being pushed , kathy still believes that you must satisfy your own needs first . or , you can do with as little as you possibly can , says the diet-conscious and wise vampire , peina . if you want to see a film that is more credible than this one , that handles the same subject , but injects more life and fear into its story , and less philosophy and guilt-ridden religious themes , check out larry fessenden's habit . "
186,"an inanely delightful and slickly done and predictable escapist film , based on an actual hostage situation in st . louis . this gives danny a chance to match wits with sabian , and the two stellar actors take it from there . the only thing the story surprisingly lacked was an intelligent dialogue , though the story itself often took the high road as it was presented in a reasonably intelligent manner . it didn't stoop to gratuitous violence and seemed to be trying to say something about the proper procedures to follow in a hostage situation . it's all routine-fare , with hardly any surprises , a stylish and carefully orchestrated film , challenging what the concepts of loyalty among colleagues and friends means when things go wrong , and how well you really know someone that you have been friends with , even if it is as long as 20 years . the cast includes david morse , in a robotic role as s . w . a . t . it is directed with a certain air of incredulousness by f . gary gray , who seems to make light of the fact that danny had to take hostages to prove his point . the film moves along at a quick pace , interrupted by valid action scenes from time-to-time , allowing the film to be an easy watch for those who are not that demanding of a storyline but prefer instead good action sequences . this glossy run-of-the mill action film should be very successful on its video rental trade , as it is a visually pleasing film , with a happy ending to boot , and nothing symbolic in it to tax your brain . just about right for the market it is geared to . "
187,"though the film subtly is weighted in favor on the feminist side of the question , it still for most of the film chooses , instead , to overtly attack both sides for caring only about their opinions and not about the individual . since the film will not offer its opinion about what to do with this not so nice or redeemable idler , but chooses to show its fairness by unfairly attacking both sides of the abortion argument . this leaves us wondering how much the filmmaker really cared about ruth . so it doesn't really surprise me that a film tackling a taboo political subject should be so cautious and centrist in its views . but what bothers me , is that this film came on pretending to be hip to the problems of the homeless . norm echoes all the obnoxious slogans and dogmas and hypocrisies of his fundamental christian beliefs . everyone in the film is stereotyped : the pro-lifers are republicans , religious fanatics , family value people , sexually repressed , drivers of station wagons , and self-righteous . the pro-choicers are democrats , lesbians , pagan worshippers , those with loose morals , without god , and insincere . again , the arguments against both sides is handled in an even-handed manner . both leaders are viewed as hypocrites . the only thing that can save this film from its cautious stand , is what you thought of dern's performance . and that is the rub against the picture , it can't get beyond the absurd nature of its satire , as everyone in the film remains a cartoon figure . so the outcome should come as no particular surprise . could this really be payne's idea of how to resolve the issue ? as for dern's grating and , at times , just too much of an annoying performance , it failed to evoke concern for her plight . by the film's end she still appeared to be white-trash , to be laughed at and dismissed as being someone society can't help . the entire film's satire was a futile effort at comedy . it's weak position on the issues allowed it to throw stones at everyone and seem like it was hip to what was going on , but in reality it changed no one's mind about abortion ; and , in the bargain , it wasn't a particularly funny film . "
188,"he ends up stealing the film with his energetic comical rendition of a buffoon . this character has always been considered one of shakespeare's best comedy roles . love in this fairyland setting has more to do with chance than anything else since it is blind . the mix-ups that follow puck's interference , create new difficulties and allow for the lovers to be manipulated and mismatched by puck's magic . shakespeare's magic wasn't working ; and , i think that was because an hour or so of the play's dialogue was lopped off , making this three hour play into a two hour movie . the consequences are that the characters couldn't be fully developed ; in fact , the film had a flatness to it that belied how good its lush cinematography made it look . instead of character development , we got rolls in the mud to convey the deep feelings of how the young lovers felt about the confusion puck's love potions had on them . too dumb down shakespeare even further , there were times when the director used obvious facial gestures by the characters to let us in on how to react to what they were doing . this is sort of like the canned responses for those tv shows , where a sign is held up to let the audience know when to applaud . what was eloquent about the film , that made it a passable viewing experience , was due to the superb cast , a mixture of true shakespearian british actors ; such as , anna friel , christian bale , and dominic west , and the feisty non-shakespearian actors , calista flockhart , stanley tucci , rupert everett and michelle pfeiffer . then there was the stirring use of verdi's greatest operatic hits throughout the film , which fitted conveniently in with the director's 19th century italian theme . this is a clever film ; it is much better than the scores of amateur stage productions that continually flood the country . but the director made a lot of odd choices in this film that take away somewhat from the magical feeling of the play and make it seem artificial , or more of a commercial venture than it should be . there was no artistic reason to be in 19th century italy , except for its rich landscapes and colorful costumes and beautiful villas shown . also , the flatness and clumsiness of the fairyland scenes when juxtaposed against the lively actor's troupe , made this film seem uneven , even begging us to utter with conviction the bard's choice words : "" what fools these mortals be . "" "
189,"this biting family drama hones in on the anxieties and turbulence a dysfunctional modern french family experiences , eventually uncovering all their unhappiness , but not much else is offered as for plot surprises . jean-pierre darroussin , the self-effacing waiter , denis , was reading during the show . film student , who has a knack for making wry observations regarding relationships . this realistic film is based on a play written by two of the actors here , ms . jaoui and jean-pierre bacri . in fact , this entire ensemble cast also acted in the play . she explains henri's dour disposition and lack of ambition away , with the ridiculous comment that she knew he would amount to nothing because he was a late walker . all this becomes tedious after awhile , though i'm sure it accurately portrays how some bourgeoisie families are . what i was waiting to see happen , was something momentous or inspiring , but that never really occurred . instead , what happened was that this drama went on cruise control , with a functional dialogue and characters who really did seem to resemble each other after awhile . the basic plot revolved around the problems the children have . nonetheless , this was a somewhat satisfying if not too sobering of a film experience . it really is a film that can't stop being a play , and to its detriment it can't do anything to alter that structure . it is through small changes in character development that the film succeeds best . and isn't that the way it is in real life ? this claustrophobic production , done in real time over the course of one evening , understands that . it did offer one scene , in particular , that caught my fancy . when yo-yo was given her birthday presents , it was fun to see who gave her what . this was the funniest moment in the film , and it did seem to give the characters renewed wind to charge into its final moments . the film's bleakness was somewhat lessened when we see the bookish denis and the outspoken betty riding off together on a motor scooter , hopefully to live together happily ever after . as the simple yo-yo commented on seeing that friendship , she's lucky to have such a nice guy . it seems everyone but the snobbishly recalcitrant and ever nagging mother learned a little something this evening about themselves . "
190,"an enjoyable b- movie but not quite as good as its reputation suggests it would be . if you can suspend critical judgment regarding the thinness of the story and the robotic acting and taut dialogue that should have been made funnier instead of playing it so straight , then you should be in a receptive mood for what the 1950s took for schlock cyberspace . we are in the prime time of hardened cold war attitudes , which are bristling with military solutions and a case of good old paranoia to keep us on our toes . so what better or easier target for all our pent up anxieties , than for the martians to be the bad guys . now there might be just as many people in this country who believe in flying saucers as there are who don't , so when we see a flying saucer land in someone's backyard and disappear in the ground , the film is on familiar sci-fi turf . in this cheapie production , he makes the most of the sets he created , and in the final battle scenes between the army and the martians , they look good enough to add a certain amount of necessary chills to the film . anyway , life on mars doesn't seem so hot , so why not come to america the land of opportunuty , a haven for those seeking a better life . the only thing serious about this movie , is that it was done in a serious manner . aside from that , it's a harmless tingler with enough thrills in it to make it pleasantly watchable . it is one of those movies where you can find enough in it to think it wasn't so bad ; and , it really wasn't so bad when you come to think about it . the most interesting part of it , is that it gives you a clear view of 1950s attitudes . it reflected a time that was much different from the way things are now : parents spoke to their children in a respectful manner and vice versa , there was a na ? vet ? in its political concerns , and it idealized the small town concepts of america . there are many old-timers who wish america could return to those simpler times . . . even though those times had masked the bigger problems they couldn't face , the problems that blew up in the '60s and changed the language and attitudes of the country . this film was made 46 years ago but seems as if it came from a nostalgic time that will never be with us again . it is worth seeing mainly for those reasons . "
191,"a fine looking , but extremely lightweight satire from tom dicillo ( living in oblivion , box of moonlight ) . i could not take this satirical comedy as a serious work of satire , as the story is rife with unresolved issues it brings up just to be seemingly ironical but with not enough conviction or intensity of purpose to make something out of its mocking tone , that is attacking both the television and fashion industry . all the characters are busy pursuing their goals to succeed in the image-oriented fashion industry or in the cheesy video and tv soap opera markets of new york . unfortunately , the satire has little bite to it . dicillo couldn't make up his mind what he wanted to do , so the characters end up as being viewed as satires of themselves . i'm sure no one in the "" industry "" is going to be too taken aback by this film's attack on them . but the audience will see a well crafted film , that is pleasant to watch , but with hardly any laughs to garner from it . their story is what is supposed to tug at our heart strings and also make us laugh , as they try and handle all the obstacles they are up against . this seems to make them out to be more real than bob and sahara ; at least , in their eyes . it succeeded in telling their side of the story . the only thing is that their story was not that different from those who were depicted as being superficial . this was especially amusing because joe had to betray all his lofty views just to get this vulgar job , before losing it because he mouths off to an ignorant assistant director . but all the film added up to , was an easy to watch , slick nyc life-style satirical story about those trying to make it in the glamor business , told by an interesting director who tried to say something more than what was actually said . "
192,"to go back and see what that city is like now , should be interesting , especially since there is very little media coverage of saigon that reaches main street america . this rather sentimental elegy to his country , plays much like a travelogue , bent on painting a pretty picture of the country despite the sad tale it tells of four diverse , gentle souls , whose symbolic fictionalized venture will prove to be very touching , as we follow them around saigon and observe them as their lives sometimes interact with each other . what the film lacks is a real poet's cutting edge and tension , and what is also astonishingly absent , is a view of the political situation . but what is even more astonishing , is the complete lack of anger from those who are poor , whose lives are so polarized from the very rich . there is little risk taken here by the director , who has shot a purposefully fictionalized account of vietnam , showing only that it is being swallowed up by capitalism and its own passivity . the coca-cola signs and the luxurious hotels serve only as reminders that this country is being overtaken by commercialism and greed , nevertheless the director seems content to film his picturesque view of the city , as is , of these materialistic intrusions appearing without any kind of analysis as to why . the pastel colors of the film and the brightness of the city , allow even the squalid slum section of town to appear to be picture perfect . another symbolic message , this time relating to their country and how it must learn to love itself without being gobbled up by foreigners . the season is summer and it is extremely hot . everything gets tidied up in nice little packages by the film's end and every one walks away enchanted , and this very picturesque take on saigon , that seems to be a love affair the director is having with his ancestral country , turns out to be an irksome charmer to behold . it lacks what it thinks it has : poetic vision . there is not much substance in its lyrics , and its beauty can only be taken as skin deep . when we think about what this film was saying , there is not much there that is perceptive enough to add something worthwhile to its lugubrious tale . the plain truth is , that there was just nothing striking said during this well-crafted film to hold our attention . it was mostly an arty kind of mush , fed to a western audience that is dying to see something nice about vietnam , even if that something can't get past being sentimental jive . the clich ? d story had too many coincidences and improbabilities in it , and an incomplete picture of how this city now functions , for its story to be considered as being relevant to the topic it covered , except by those who are pleased and willing to see something about vietnam that lets them forget about the war and the terrible conflicts it brought to both countries . "
193,"a typical 1950s noir , distinguished by its rapid pace and taut script , that delves mainly into the character of the villain-- making him out to be someone who went over-the-edge when he couldn't take being ridiculed as a failure , anymore . by being nearly blind and wearing thick glasses for his myopia , he assumes the role of a victim in society , visually manifesting a pathos based on this physical handicap . this the suburban atmosphere and the no nonsense style of telling the story , are a stark contrast to the suspense building up for the very characteristic 1950s couple . the blandness of the story and the failure to elicit anything out of the ordinary , play against the competence of this well-crafted script . the result is a watchable film , which could be seen for the sense of nostalgia it evokes to a more receptive time for noir to work as well as it does . "
194,"a wonderfully hokey b-movie , that is a derivative thriller from the director with all the gimmicks , william castle ( tingler ) . here he uses a fright-clock on screen , giving those audience members who are too frightened to see the scary conclusion , a chance to leave the theater . we don't have showmen like castle around anymore , instead we got corporate executive types running the studios , looking only at the bottom line . they have taken the fun out of promoting a movie and have made it just another stale business marketing venture . castle also effectively features in homicidal a lot of copycat things from other films , such as the psychotic mannerisms of the killer , which was lifted straight out of psycho . that the story makes absolutely no sense and has more holes in it than swiss cheese , is besides the point . it's obvious that he will grow up to be a sick one . the pyscho-dynamics of this twisted yarn , as they unfold , are a real hoot to watch . emily and warren ( jean arless ) speak in unnatural stilted tones , while karl and miriam go out together and are so sugary sweet that one could hyperventilate by just watching them . homicidal is a classical horror film , but featuring mediocre acting and plot ; its one gigantic plus is the interesting characterization by jean arless , who seems to be swimming in a different stream than the rest of the cast . the ending is predictable but fun to watch , and for that matter , this shamelessly exploitative film is a total gas . castle himself introduces the film , and thereby gets you in the right mood to see this shocker . if you are in the proper humor for a movie that doesn't take itself that seriously , you have nothing to lose by seeing it , which is the attitude the bellboy had when he mumbled just those sentiments to himself before accepting the bizarre marriage proposal offered him by the seemingly attractive blonde . this is the kind of film that defies critical analysis , if you're in the mood for schlock-shock , this could be a most entertaining film . "
195,"this social comedy is a slick sick one , told in short sketches , where absurdity and perversity go hand-in-hand with the dress , which is the subject of the film . the fashion designer of this plain summer dress is a pervert with a pig fetish , and to add insult to injury , it is worn by losers who are taken in by its optimistic design and colors . on the dresses journey , it brought bad luck to whomever owned it , passing to different ownership many times ; the film could have gone on ad infinitum , if the director wasn't kind enough to end the film with a good old mercy killing of it . but by making it just an object , giving it no other symbolic significance , the film has to rely on its biting satiric humor to carry it through . and since , i couldn't find myself consistently laughing at its monthy python-like skits , nor find its outrageous humor and politically incorrect stands to be paricularly tasteful , i therefore found myself under-whelmed with this third film by the independent cult film director , even as i empathize with his determination to make his own type of film , no matter how it is perceived by others . this bawdy comedy , should guarantee it some audience abroad , though those seeing it in the netherlands , have an added plus going for them , as they should be more able to recognize the cameos that some of the notable dutch film stars make in it . this was the most risque and politically incorrect scene in the film , but it also turned out to be a rather tame but funny scene , after all . but the humor came at the expense of the pathetic lady being chased by the rapist , who when in trouble would shout out , "" i'm normal . "" this rape scene was crasser than the other one , for a few moments it had the same hard edge of violence to it that a film like "" funny games "" had . since i was not all that amused by what i saw and did not find the film particularly perceptive , and only found parts of the film to be diverting and original , it is hard for me to recommend it as anything but an attempt to be outrageously funny without enough substance in it to be funny for a long enough period of time to be a fully entertaining movie . and it is only from an entertainment perspective , i think , that this film should be judged . "
196,"why he doesn't turn the head over to the police , the most logical thing in the world to do , is never fully explained to my satisfaction . all this spy business was rather vaguely done , and gave no particular credence to the story , except it did show a large vacuousness among the young as to their country's recent history . what the film couldn't do , was make all this interesting and tangible to the story it was telling . a story which threw out many possible situations , but never delved fully into them . yet it was somewhat diverting as a study of the students and their attitudes . the naive hero is not convincing enough in his role as a seeker of justice and the film as a political thriller suffers from a lack of focused direction . it was a good idea for a film , that tried to show that metaphorically opposites might attract but can't stay together , but it was too poorly executed for one to sustain an interest in its long drawn out meandering story . "
197,"this original youth film , that has the look of a pseudo-documentary but is a work of fiction , with the nonprofessional actors seemingly changing mid-scene from reading a script to doing ad-libs , fails to answer the simple questions i put to it about what it is trying to accomplish . this is director and writer , harmony korine's ( screenwriter for kids ) , debut film as a director , accomplished with all the verve and necessary shock and schlock he can muster . what results is a pointless but engaging romp through a midwestern fictional suburban city , xenia , ohio , and its dysfunctional inhabitants , mostly white redneck youth , who either seem retarded or prone to violence , as they are searching for something to do with themselves in a city still suffering from the devastations of a tornado . korine is non-judgmental about any of his characters . but is that necessarily a good thing ? what saves this film from being a complete absurdity , is the raw energy exhibited by the director , as he is on the cutting edge of cinema verite , showing the pent-up hostility and alienation these trashy young people have . he seems to be painting his words with images of the most freakish things you can see in america's wasteland , and not caring whether you believe what you are seeing or not--his aim seems to be to shock the audience and for the audience to respond and say how "" hip "" he is to be showing us all these revolting and boring images . but is that enough to make this a satisfactory film ? two skin head teens senselessly punching it out with each other for an interminable amount of time in their kitchen for fun and macho pride . but by showing all these freaks , is the director not just using them without any purpose but to exploit their oddness ? is this funny scene a comment on single-moms ? the film has an attention disorder disturbance of its own , as it keeps going at random from one vignette to another , without any deciferable plot or storyline , which should be a real treat for heavy metal enthusiasts with low attention spans and those who respect the personal creative nature of film and can overcome the depravity of what they are seeing and its immature fixations , and be impressed with the film's originality . for those lucky souls , they have found a film that is a rarity . but have they found a good film ? others who might like this film , could be taken in by the audaciousness of the director's style and the fast-pace of the film and its easy disposable use of images . but to its credit , the film does capture some of the fears the youths have about growing up and it does show that there are no role models around to help the children . but does the filmmaker really care about what he is seeing ? this film will probably be viewed as one that you either hate or love , and no one can convince you otherwise . since i was caught being in a voyeuristic mode by some of the film , then found myself tuning it out as i became bored with it ; i , therefore , can only say that the film did not work for me . it is hard for me to warm up to those who kill cats , yet i wanted to see how the minds of such people work . that i found out . which is the problem i had with watching the film , as i felt that i didn't need a mind to see it . this film lacked the needed pathos to make the youngsters' story seem more than a provocative freak show ; it failed to offer some meaning to their life , which resulted in giving the film a disjointed look , even though korine should be applauded for sticking to his personal vision . but , the final question is , do you think the director is really interested in showing us anything but a freak show ? "
198,"a most improbable but engaging romantic mystery that holds our attention and teases our sensibilities . there are signs that what is happening to the two lovers is getting to be heavy , and what seems to be is not exactly what is . the storyline is awkward , melodramatic and incredulous , and the ending is somewhat ludicrous and overplayed , but what becomes interesting is the psychological games played by the couple . the basque director/writer has created a story with enough twists in it to keep you guessing at what will happen next , but the film left me with a bitter-sweet reaction to the romance . "
199,"in the film version the hero succumbs to all the violence around him and gets his revenge , as by the film's end he happily wins a fist fight from his nemesis . everything that could be wrong about this school is wrong with it , as the classroom teachers , the brothers , all have crosses dangling from their robes , as if to remind the viewer that religion was something no one in this school believed in anymore , it was just something to be worn for show . it is so perverse a place , that there seems to be no way to function in it without selling your soul . the acting is superb . the story is gloomy and perceptive . there seems to be no real voice of reason . the heroes are too dull and without any real conviction to fight these fascists they are up against . all-in-all , a pretty disgusting lot , which makes this film a tough watch , with not enough elasticity to its story than to be more than a coming-of-age film that ultimately brings up the wrong lesson in life to learn : that it is sometimes better to conform than to rebel . the film itself lacked any sustaining energy to show that it really cared about the enemy it was fighting . it looked like it was too in love with the evil elite being depicted and invested too much in their presence to properly distance themselves from them and tell the story of the resistance fighter , like it needed to be told . "
200,"therefore the film chooses not to focus too much on the precocious kid's gift , going almost exclusively for his father's nightmarish visions to tell its tale . as a result , the lesson being becomes : never play mind games you don't understand with someone inexperienced and not completely reliable who has you under their power . though , at times , the story is close to losing it , getting enveloped in melodramatics , it manages to pull back and return to the family and their struggle with the existence of a ghost in their house and their marital problems , keeping the film suspenseful , allowing you to overlook if you care to , the many holes in the story . the film just lost control of what it had going for it that made it different from , let's say , another recent ghost film , the sixth sense , and plummeted it back into the world of the run-of-the mill films of that genre . it is illustriously shot and its ghostly visions are stunningly creepy . it also captures in its sights the good , bad , and ugly of chicago . this fast moving film has hooked onto the nuances of its working class neighborhood completely , and by being grounded with this kind of reality the ghost story becomes more effective . >from this character driven film , we learn that ghosts get angry when we don't respond to them properly . that the afterworld is a place that some of us more than others have a chance to penetrate and if we do , we better learn how to listen . kevin bacon plays the role convincingly , with just the right amount of skepticism and psychological tension , coming close but never going over the top , like a lesser actor might have been tempted to do . zachary david cope seems like a child who is used to seeing strange things all his life and is rather placid and accepting about it , playing his role as well as could be expected . but i did have some problems that what was happening to him was not more fully developed . i felt i didn't really know much more about him by the film's end than from its beginning . in both sequences ghosts are communicating with him . i just had the feeling that the kid could end up being a basket case if his folks didn't take some time to help him deal with his gift , and that even though they were hard working and nice people , they were not a very perceptive couple . what transpires is an ok ghost story , a suspenseful story of an ordinary couple trying to cope with something that they are not prepared for , and a weak murder story , that ruins the film , as it brings it down to earth in a most desultory manner . is the film worth seeing ? yes . it is entertaining and spooky , and you get taken on an emotional roller coaster ride . no . it is earthbound and contrived , and the ending is a stinker . take your pick , both answers are correct . "
201,"ridicule ( director : patrice leconte ; screenwriters : remi waterhouse/eric vicaut/michel fessler ; cinematographer : thierry arbogast ; cast : charles berling ( baron gregoire ponceludon de malavoy ) , jean rochefort ( marquis de bellegarde ) , fanny ardant ( madame de blayac ) , judith godreche ( mathilde de bellegarde ) , bernard giraudeau ( abbot de vilecourt ) , urbain cancelier ( louis xvi ) , 1996-fr . ) for a film that prides itself on its use of wit to show what the nobility and their king louis xv1 were like during 1783 , just before the infamous french revolution , i would have expected to be more than dazzled by these nobles with their silver-tongued wit , cutting each other to bits and pieces with their razor-sharpened retorts . instead , i found myself more taken with the history aspect of this good looking costume spectacle and was not especially amused by the barbs . in fact , i found the film rather anti-septic , not a particularly moving dramatic experience . overrated by some of the critics , who seemed to fall for this french film's farcical intentions , deeming it intellectual in the broadest sense of what is intellectual , while failing to construe how ordinary and dispassionate the characters were . part fiction and part history , this satire , as directed by patrice leconte ( monsieur hire/the hairdresser's wife ) , is not completely absorbing in its romantic tale or as drama . the history part seemed to be accurate enough , depicting the corruption of the king's court and his placement of more importance on vacuous wit than genuine ideas . he thinks ponceludon might have some chance of succeeding in being witty and offers him lessons of how to survive in versailles , such as , "" don't laugh at your own jokes and never laugh with your mouth open "" , "" call puns the death of wit "" ; and remember , "" the soul of wit is to know one's place . "" what elevates this film above merely showing how obviously stupid and petty the nobles were , is that it stresses how the nobles had to use language to survive in that atmosphere . this film is also about a moral dilemma for our good-hearted hero . he must choose either what is morally correct or to sell himself out for his project , which he considers as something that is more important than how he might be perceived . the acting or the story did not excite me enough to think that this clever film was anything special , except as a mildly diverting farce , which could be , at best , considered only as a film that had its moments of being a clever satire . but mostly , it is a predictable french farce , with enough one-dimensional characters in it to fill the court of versailles with retorts that would pale next to those heard in an average schoolyard in urban america on a daily basis . "
202,"alan ( trouble in mind , choose me , moderns ) rudolph's off-beat film has the look and feel of bad melodrama , using over-exaggerated action sequences to spin a convoluted yarn ( maybe a parody ) about twins , born to a ballerina who had an affair with a european aristocrat and is forced into giving them up for adoption when he wants no part of her . the title of the film , as defined , will refer to the equality of the light and dark sides during an equinox . she weaves this ambiguous tale or spoof , or whatever it is , together . as all the quirky characters will somehow fit into the story and by the end of the film , i guess , there is supposed to be some hidden message as henry stands alone , looking down at the tremendous depths of the grand canyon . there was one stupid line she said to him that made me laugh primarily because it was so stupid , "" you're not going to catch nothing from me but your breath . "" in fact , the only enjoyment i derived from all the banal dialogue and its embarrassing story ( if it wasn't a parody , then it's a horrible script , and if it is a parody , it doesn't work , the story is too ambiguous ) was the b- movie one-liners that kept coming throughout the film . since that's the only thing i liked about this film , i'll drop a few of them on you : freddy to another gangster , "" never miss a good chance to shut up . "" one gangster talking to another , "" i was so popular in high school , everybody hated me . "" i'll mention two quotes mr . petosa gives us from his vaudeville shtick he seemed to be doing for his characterization , "" if money didn't grow on trees , how come banks have so many branches ? "" and "" chaste makes waste . "" henry tritely says , "" my whole life seems to be taking place without me in it . "" beverly to henry , which is the most pertinent line in the film , banal as it is , "" your whole life is searching for one thing , and all that other stuff just fades away . "" i don't know what the story is supposed to mean ; maybe its just a search-for-identity kind of film ; maybe its an updated fairytale about "" the prince and the pauper , "" as one critic suggests . but i found it to be muddled , unfunny , and the acting is so lame , especially matthew modine's overacting , that it is almost unbearable to watch . but i got a kick out of those stupid one-liners from all the zanies trying so hard to be to be zany , and there was something intangible about the film that made you keep watching it , hoping there was something there that you missed seeing . so , at least , it's an original film ; a passable one , at that , with a lot of possibility to it ; and , it is done in the bizarre auteur style this filmmaker likes to operate in . "
203,"the game is a manipulative but entertaining film that falls far short of director fincher's more successful , seven . the game takes on dangerous pretensions , as douglas wonders if this is really a game or is it to be taken for real , or is he just being scammed . we watch him begin to unravel , and you are perhaps feeling like i do at this point of the story , that i am being set-up , following a tale that is so unbelievable , that i am being taken for a sucker to buy into this . anyway , we are not that concerned about douglas , maybe that's because we don't have much to go on why he is as obnoxious and joyless as he is , except we learn that his father committed suicide when he was a child and he never quite got over it . the best feature of the film is its unpredictability , it is what sucks you into watching the entire film expecting something sensational to take place . i thought any ending would be apt . i never got a sense that what was happening mattered . and when you become conscious that what is going on is all acting and only acting , even if films are just that , nevertheless , they should hold out the illusion that what is on screen is real , and if that is not so , then it becomes natural to lose interest in the story and you become prepared to accept whatever it is that you see happening on the screen , whatever the director wants to put in , any logic will do . i felt nothing as i watched to see if douglas will commit suicide , or if this is really an on-the-level game , or if douglas will be transformed by the game into a better human being ( which to me would be the phoniest way for this film to end ) . so when i saw what actually developed , i could only think of how clever this filmmaker is , that he used the same formula that someone making toothpaste commercials might use to catch the consumer's attention . art is more metaphorical than that , commercial films are not , their bottom line is always the almighty dollar and the gimmick that will get it for them . this film should be pleasing to those who like to play games . the director is a graduate from the video and advertising world , well able to work in that slick media market , who has come up with a novel idea for a film but one that falls short in being credible . "
204,"all she can say is , that she needs my help because she is weak . she learns that others think her do-gooder nature causes more harm to others than good , that if she can't help in a positive way she should step aside and let the other person fend for themselves ; that she does this because she is a self-indulgent person . the acting was convincing , but the story didn't have enough suspense in it to sustain interest , especially when the ending was becoming increasingly predictable , as the story wore on . what interested me in a rather oblique way , was how tired life in poland seemed , and how the real enemy seemed to be the bureaucratic nature of the country , that was off-handedly touched upon in the scenes at work , as the love triangle waned in my interest . i thought of how different things were in america during that time frame of the '70s , and how similar bureaucracies seem to be wherever they exist , whatever the time frame is . "
205,"this film's narrative promises much to say about how violent man is , as it uses contemporary l . a . for its location . but in the end , it fails to deliver the goods ; for reasons that are not artistically clear to me , wenders decides to abruptly check out of this slow developing non-story and end it without resolving it satisfactorily . the film seemed to be oozing completely out of energy and purpose . it made me wonder why wenders seemed to be so concerned in the first place with the socio-political manifestations of a top-secret government project gone awry and the public being exploited by hollywood ; and then , he concentrated for most of the film on the usual crime stuff of murder and missing persons , basically ignoring what he tried so hard to bring to center stage . i have always found wenders to be a bit pretentious ; and , at the same time , alluring . he always seems to bait me into thinking there is something more to his films than there are . there are exceptions , like his wonderful film wings of desire , but most of the time i feel that i am being intellectually short-changed by such deceptions . this picture is a perfect example of what i mean . most interesting and diverting scenes in this part of the film concern the poetry performance readings that some of the movie folks attend . one of the readings is more powerful than anything that has to do with the story being told . is wenders being the arty wenders , creating interest by being evocative no matter what the film calls for . i am not challenging his use of such scenes , they are wonderful ; but , i am put off by his inability to keep the story from going cold . the last part of this narrative , has all these parts of the tale come together for a violent conclusion . it leaves us with the belief that the violence will not be curtailed , but will go on ; therefore , there will be no such a thing as an end to violence . thereby , the film's title is the opposite of what the film really means to say . or , is it ? wenders has succeeded in creating a mishmash of images that are incendiary , but not penetrating enough for us to believe in the characters of the story , or to follow through on what this film is supposed to be about . in fact , you might be angrier and more prone to have a violent reaction to the film , than you would be to believe that wenders has taken this film in the direction needed for us to see what is meant by an end of violence . he lost me somewhere down the line . it seems to be a film concerned about government conspiracies and missing persons , but turns out to be more concerned with societal problems , values , and alienation , and does not do any of these topics sufficient justice in covering it . this results in a film that has a few good ideas but goes astray , leaving it with a disjointed look , that is artistically satisfying to watch but empty of meaningful inquiry . "
206,"it succeeds mostly in being a visceral experience and for those who like to see brad pitt' pecs and how edward norton squirms when beaten up , and be bemused to hear helena bonham carter complain that the boys sure love their violence more than they do sex . the film eventually knocks itself out from hitting itself so much in the "" old "" noggin without really damaging its unspecified opponent-- society as a whole . the sheer nonsense of its storyline causes that knockout by relying on a ridiculous metaphor to make its point , too much glitter , and pitt' and norton' overacting ; what results is a jarring experience , enough to make you think without thinking that being sado-masochistic is the way to achieve respect ( it doesn't matter if this is meant to be a parody reflecting the violence in america : the violence is the thing in this story that the audience will remember most about this film ) . it succeeds in this venture only as a disturbing film , which makes the provocative assertion that those who are self-absorbed and mindless and go over-the-edge by doing violent acts are supposedly looking for hidden meanings in their life , which are given to them by false prophets , something that is happening currently in america to a great extent . but this film is too stilted , unconvincing , and inane to be the messenger delivering a warning about such dangers in society . but if its comedy that it is after , then it has some success in meeting those expectations , as the stars were able to project themselves into this story with enough animation to give the film a titillating lift . the more we get to know about the engaging soap salesman who is selling not only soap but a nihilistic philosophy , the more we learn how depraved he is . human lives are not part of this equation . a homo-erotic edge to their relationship is also hinted at , but like everything in this film , it is only superficially covered . the narrator suffers from insomnia , probably caused by his non-meaningful life . the utterly depraved tyler , exhibiting the ability to be a leader , with a need to offer sanctimonious maxims against the emptiness of materialism , such as , "" you are not your job , "" and the irresolute narrator , who is someone crying out for help and who is also someone ripe for being brainwashed . that all this is supposed to be funny is a matter of taste , though i think it is funny in a juvenile sort of way , where bad taste rules the day . the humor is catered to those who like their laughs coming to them shock treatment style . their alienation from society , supposedly , relates to those in the audience who also feel powerless about all the violence taking place in the country and now will have been amply warned by the filmmaker not to follow charismatic leaders and join cults that offer easy solutions to their problems , which should give the film a conventional reason for being made . the problem with the film's message , is that it comes via a film that is relying on the excesses of violence to put over its exploitive story , and then , to have this filmmaker be the voice of reason , is almost enough to make the average citizen who is concerned about the recent shootings in america's schools and the other sensational newsworthy violent acts , wonder what to make of this film , or to just barf at this outlandishly childish attempt to answer some very serious problems in such a mindlessly simple way . the fatuous simplicity the film offers for linking america's penchant for violence and sex , with the peoples' lack of fulfillment from meaningful jobs , is too much of a generality to be taken seriously . this response to what has gone wrong with the american dream is just as banal and wrong-headed a response , as those who would blame films such as this one for america's problems . at some point in the film , probably as soon as the fight club was started by tyler teaching the nerd how to fight and the club was then expanded into franchises across the country and evolved into a secret society of mayhem , the film stopped being smart and turned into a pointless nonsensical venture , that is not serious enough to take seriously , except it should be complimented for its imaginative visual style and kinetic energy it shows . the film's undercurrent philosophical sub theme stated by tyler , that "" it's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything , "" is an alluring one . if that were developed further along in the storyline , then there would be some intellectual challenges to a film that tries very hard to be nihilistic but fails miserably to make a cogent case for that belief or whatever it is trying to say , such as the drivel about this being a film about freeing the masculine soul from the shackles of a consumer society . i didn't fall under brad pitt' spell as easily as edward norton and helena bonham carter did , and therefore was not in a receptive mood for how the film was finally resolved . for me , this was a lightweight film that mistakingly thinks it's in the heavyweight class . what it offers for philosophy , is similar to the kind of superficial sound bites the tv news might offer to comment on its headline stories , as the news people seem to always play it safe and never take a radical position on the events they cover . what the film offers as philosophy is pseudo-philosophy , for a story that is more steeped in violence than interested in understanding its ramifications in a consumer society . it is just too easy to be against the fascists and the yuppies , and the emptiness of their materialistic lives . exploring that avenue , and not getting bogged down in showing another escapist violent film , might have been a more radical route to have gone down . it was very hard for me to see this unconventional mainstream film as anything more than a film that showed promise and had a lot of zip to it , but was disappointing in its scope . . . and . . . was certainly not a radical film . "
207,"as you might surmise from a mainstream film like this , it wants to pull you along with all the heartaches it can muster from these lonely souls , and it does so , by making use of semi flashbacks and scenes that have a mixture of fantasy and reality to it . to a lesser degree , this style of filmmaking also works for the less complicated pat , as his mental grief comes pouring out in spurts . the film's title , living out loud , is deliberately misleading , as it should really be retitled as "" fantasizing out loud . "" this therefore becomes a film more intrigued with self-awareness than with relationships and loses its edge as a romantic film . its brightest hope is how the viewer relates to the film's stars . i didn't , so the film just seemed to drag for me at times and it seemed manipulative , to the bargain . my problem is that i didn't really care what happened to them . why they were sad and lonely , is a sympathetic enough story , but there was just nothing served up that made me feel that this predictable story had anywhere important to go . the only innovative feature of the film , which did save it from the doldrums , was that we were able to go inside their heads and hear their thinking process at work . the filmmaker has borrowed this guise of introspection from the pages of chekhov , which works out reasonably well on film , though it is still better served as a device for the reader of books . at least the film never turns to mush , as its static atmosphere is enhanced mostly by some of the lively nightclub scenes , such as when liz is belting out her sultry jazz numbers and offering good cheer for advice ( trust me , it wasn't on a par to the biblical solomon's advice ) . but i couldn't picture them falling in love for even a second and certainly not for a minute , these two were just not compatable . but come to think of it , she's pretty dull herself . the fantasy she has of making it with the hunk masseur ( cibrian ) , who gives her the sex massage she dreams of , are the kind of private thoughts that perhaps more people have than what is commonly thought , but this is certainly not a way to self-discovery and a way out of her situation , though it seems to help her in someway , but the film has really not made it clear how she was helped . this bittersweet romance turns out to be too dry for my taste ; but , it is , nevertheless , faultlessly told and seems to be sincere in its presentation , and what the heck , they seem to be ok people , and probably merit a tad of sympathy for their plight . his attempt here to make a combination fantasy and a straight romance film , has worked with mixed results . i think the major fault for the film's dullness lies with the co-stars ; i couldn't get aroused by holly hunter's performance , as intelligent as it was , it was still too plain and too staid . while danny de vito , who is a natural comic and is best at being featured as a second-banana , wasn't funny enough here and couldn't be taken seriously enough as a romantic suitor for holly . i'm not saying that he was completely miscast , he did bring some depth to his character's anguished situation and believability to his role . but someone else , a more romantic leading man , might have given the film a romantic tension to it that it desperately needed . though i realize the point of the story was that these two weren't really suited for each other in the first place and that this was the odd twist to their non-romance . but my point is , that they could have been not suited for each other all right , but not by such a wide margin as these two were . but that was also too predictable an ending , limiting the scope of the film . "
208,"this b-movie , made in b/w , is a cheapie from american-international pictures , and is good for a few laughs and a few shakes of the head . when he tries to read the bible it has shrunk so much , that the print is too small for him to read . it is also a trip to watch this bald headed giant eat like a giant does and to see how he simply dwarfs all those who visit him . the special effects were fine , the quasi documentary atmosphere it presented helped give it the look of a cold war era film ; the movie was seriously done but nevertheless it was hilarious . what the film failed to do , was be anything but cynical . for all its failings and ridiculous dialogue i , nevertheless , enjoyed watching this 80 minutes of hokum . mercifully , the film wasn't any longer . "
209,"benedict heinrich , head of a fascist government ) - are in a horror film that shows little affinity for the genre and apart from a few scares , this is a rather tepid effort put forth by the director . scream and scream again was based on peter saxon's novel 'the disoriented man , ' but it is the story that seems out of whack rather than the title . these are the quirky characteristics found throughout the film that makes its humor rather odd and might appeal to certain fans of this genre . the result is a race of emotionless and mindless androids . the film ends with a cryptic warning by fremont that all is not over with yet . this muddled story is not supposed to make sense and it doesn't , it is supposed to shock your senses and if you were thusly shocked , i suppose you got your money's worth out of this b- film . there is no real character study accomplished . the dialogue ranged from being trite to being ludicrous . overall , this was a weakly crafted film that probably has brought to the surface enough undeveloped ideas in it , to make it a somewhat bearable film to view during parts of it and a film that fans of the three horror stars should want to see , if for no other reason but for that alone . "
210,"it also puts him in a depressed mood , as he says he would rather die than live and not play his music . the remainder of the film flounders in long stretches of unbelievable fantasy , some soothing touches of originality here and there , oodles of romantic schmaltz , and a story that can't hold up to intelligent scrutiny . but , then again , if you bought into the film's gimmicky filmmaking style and didn't think it was a smarty-arty pretentious ploy like i did , then maybe you can have a better feel for how the story transpired than i did . pabst's silent masterpiece . catherine gets a chance at the dinner table to tell izzy , that she gave up acting because i didn't want to be invented by anyone , anymore . but the funniest conversation at the dinner table is reserved for one between izzy and phil , as phil wants izzy's opinion on what he would do if he found a piece of turd on an airplane toilet seat cover after an attractive lady left the toilet , like he did on a recent flight . you see , it was a contrivance for the script . the filmmaker must have thought it would work out better for the story if he gets jumped in nyc rather than in dublin . all we get to know about the mystery of the stone is from dr . van horn , as we hear him prattle on about how precious the stone is , and if in the right hands , such as his , how much good it can do . there will be no payoff regarding knowing about this mystery , which is a major problem with the film . there is so much wrong with this film , that even when things are going well for it and it seems like there's some suspense and an intriguing bit of artiness thrown into the script , inevitably it is ruined by a story that just doesn't make sense , and even if it did make sense to those who are more tolerant of the film than i was , it still doesn't excuse the filmmaker from trying to be too clever and disguising his story as something it isn't . to be more precise in my critique , would be to give away the film's flimsy payoff , which would not be fair to those who haven't seen lulu yet . i just got the feeling auster didn't know too much more about this mystery than the viewer did , and because of that the film is lacking substance . i also thought keitel was too old to play the love interest of a much younger sorvino , as their romance , the keystone of the film , failed to be inspiring , as it should have been for the film to have had any chance to be effective . "
211,"i think the writers got their facts mixed up about the affects of the poisonous weed , as i believe it acts as an hallucinogenic or as a poison that can kill you , but it doesn't necessarily cause drowsiness and especially not when put into caffeine . the story was trying desperately to say that inter-racial love was okay , and by having the heroic figures of the story be half-breeds , this 1956 film is going as far as it wants to go with that tolerant attitude . it is just too bad that tab is such a vanilla actor and natalie is earnest but unconvincing in her role as a half-breed . their romance has no fire in it , it was almost like it was a pedantic exercise in virtue that we were witnessing . with more suitable actors in the starring roles , this could have been a much more relevant film . the only actor with some life to him was skip homeier , but he was too much of a caricature of evil for his character to be anything but cardboard-like manic . what was out place about this film , was that despite the beautiful photography and gripping action scenes , the story covered no new ground , though it had its opportunities , but it failed to take advantage of them . what remains solid about the film , is that if you get off on watching a western with a revenge motive , then this one never strays from that motive . "
212,"a hurricane warning is issued , but because of the poor radio equipment they have , which was not properly repaired by willy , the message is cut off and they don't know how serious that storm will be . but willy's most fatal mistake was to purchase fire extinguishers that were cheap , but would comply in appearance with the air safety codes . it was purchased at the price this airline run on a shoestring could afford , the only trouble was that they were the wrong type of extinguishers for an airplane , and if used , they can cause deadly fumes to be released rather than extinguish the fire . this scares the living daylights out of the prevaricator . her role in the film is never developed , as it is based on a generalization of what someone like her should be like . this kiss is seen by the dismayed pilot . the film's ending is routine formula fare , with a few "" predictable "" surprises of heroism and villainy , the kind of middling story churned out regularly by the studios who lack the imagination to delve into anything but superficial waters . so what you have is familiary known as a typical disaster b- movie , a precursor to all those other movies of this genre that were very popular with audiences from the late '70s- on . the film fits into the formula mold that studios use over and over again , with the obligatory tense action scenes and the typical danger scenes that call for a hero to be manufactured . you know what i mean , everyone who watches films over the years will run across one like this one , which , by the way , wasn't too bad of a film to watch . the actors had enough vigor in them to keep it going , and the story seemed to move along at a brisk and mindless pace . "
213,"a 'b' movie political thriller , that was shrewd enough to get newsreel footage of the royal family and the cabinet attending the opening of parliament into its closing action scenes . the weak script and uninspiring dialogue , is compensated for by the crisp action sequences and fast pacing of the story . the revengeful hennessy has a one-track mind , never revealing anything about his character or why he should snap in this way and come up with such a ludicrous scheme , as the one he has hatched . this is one of those films that doesn't add up if you think about it . the film hopes to get by because of the taut acting jobs of its lead characters and by the semi-documentary glossy black-and-white look its color tinted film has , giving it a natural and gritty feel . but the film's ending has so many holes in its planning , that the film seems incredulous and the points it make seem dull , and its suspense is not that nerve wracking either , since you can almost bet your house that the filmmakers are not going to have the loony hennessy blow up parliament . the best things one can say about the film , was that the acting wasn't bad and it was watchable even if it was not a very believable story . "
214,"the film should be like a meditation , as the introspective primo wants to get it out of his system what it meant to be a jewish prisoner and how it was unbearable to come out of that camp and think that you could still be human . turturro plays the tragic role with an understandable quietude ( his voice barely rises above a whisper ) and with an emotional understatement , conveying a deep sadness in his gestures and deep reflections , showing how difficult it is for him to see the light of day again without feeling atrophied and lost . he is the reason for any success the film has . unfortunately , the rest of the film , as worthy an effort as it is , about a subject matter that merits to be told again and again , as its holocaust tale can't be told enough to the world for its message to sink in and should be told in a multitude of ways ; nevertheless , as compelling as the film was at times , it also shot itself in the foot by trying to tell a conventional story while the more powerful and personal tale of primo levi was somewhat sacrificed by these very typical hollywood episodic scenes of how the other characters reacted to their liberation and with rosi's added attempt to attain some comic relief from these diverse characters being poorly accomplished . the meditations of primo levi and soberness of the story were the thing to shoot for here , and all one has to do is read primo's book and see how much more gripping those images were there when read than the screen images that tended to be tedious and somewhat diverting after awhile . 'the greek' somehow is running a bordello there . cesare keeps reminding primo , don't be so glum , it is laughter that is the cure all for this misery we have undergone . for primo levi , "" god cannot exist if auschwitz exists . "" as for the film's title , rosi explained , "" life is a truce between the moment we're born and the moment we die . "" i just couldn't help feeling that this earnest attempt at capturing the mood of that horrific event , lacked whatever it takes to make this a first-rate film . "
215,"douglas fairbanks plays his first action hero role as zorro , the sort of part he will play for the rest of his film career , before this very popular film he was cast only in light comedies . he is dressed in a black mask-and- cape , which gave the role a certain amount of appeal to audiences . the film is not much on character study , instead it's filled with action sequences and a melodramatic love story between zorro , who hides his true identity of being the son of the aristocratic rancher don alejandro ( de gray ) , and the sweet lolita pukido ( marguerite ) . there is no mistake about who the goodguys and who the badguys are in this childlike adventure story . it reminded me of a charlie chaplin routine , the one where he's the tramp and is kicking the cop in his behind . the film disappointed me in many ways , not the least being , that his plan to help the poor , seemed misplaced , and that this was more a story of aristocrats and those of wealth versus bad politicians rather than the robin hood story it projected itself to be . it was really a stretch to believe that the noble zorro was anything but a rich aristocrat having a bit of sport , and finding love with someone he could have easily found love with anyway without going through his masquerade . the story itself was a cliche , featuring his cardboard-typed father wanting his son not to be an idler and make something of himself , while the son feigns being fatigued all the time and acting effeminate , performing silly magic tricks when he should be seriously courting the eligible senorita his father fixed him up with . it was the type of part you can almost expect to see in a film like this , and one that is void of any real human emotions . there are no surprises in this predictable costume actioner , but it is pleasantly shot in b&w with a tinted look to it . it should please those who like their films to be lighthearted . because it was such a successful film box-office wise and was a precursor to the type of film hollywood is noted for putting forth , it could be interesting just to see how this silent yarn compares with the viewer's take on the more modern action films . "
216,"a b- film psychological thriller from the 1942 novel by stefan zweig that runs out of thrills eventually and ends on a flat note ; but , for a while , it had its exhilarating moments of suspense . the acting by everyone but jurgens was horrid . the story made no great impression on me but it was curious to watch how someone can handle isolation by concentrating on the intricacies of a game he doesn't really understand . overall , the film was just passable entertainment , nothing more . "
217,"this seemingly laconic b&w pseudodocumentary-styled noir film , with a patriotic message supporting the u . s . war effort in korea and offering a scathing commentary on counterfeiters , comparing them to saboteurs , as the film states the most powerful weapon in america's arsenal against communism- is money , turns out to be basically a promotional movie for the work that the treasury department agents do . in this film , he never brings about any tension or real shock to the story , as he did in his first noir work . the movie reminds me of the 1950s tv series , dragnet . it is played in the same sobering tone , with no room for comedy or any quirkiness to the vanilla story unfolding . in the end , it is a certainty that everything will be wrapped up in a tidy manner . the film was based on a true story , and seems as if it were a documentary . "
218,"the film seems like a museum piece , about a time that existed long ago but strangely enough , probably , still exists . the story is told in a dry , matter-of-fact style , with the b&w photography adding a gritty feel to the secretive work environment and the snow-capped streets of ottawa . this picture had the look of something that was important , but it didn't have more to say than what any reasonable person could already assume about the soviet union . "
219,"for a film that runs close to 70- minutes , is in b&w , and is short on storyline , this b-film does a nice job in getting a hugh cast to be part of this crime caper , each getting into the act with a brief moment of quality movie time . the falcon's brother is a routine espionage story , that is crisply told in a manner that is formularised and executed to perfection . everything in this film goes as expected , the cops are gently razzed , the villains are easy to detect , the romance is easy to handle , the story is easy on the noggin , and if you are not looking for anything fancy here , you'll extract your ounce of entertainment value from it . if you've seen one falcon episode , then you might as well have said you've seen them all . this one would rate as an average one . reason they were so popular , is because they're so easy to watch and the stars exude a certain amount of charm , making these little crime capers quite enjoyable . "
220,"bosnian-born writer/director emir kusturica ( time of the gypsies , underground ) has come up with a robust ( lively music and characters with plenty of energy ) but excessive screwball comedy with felliniesque touches here and there , and before the film literally goes in the shit , it was able to show some warm romantic moments and garner many laughs from its odd-looking and strangely-acting characters . grga pitic ( sabri sulejman ) is the old-wily patriarch enamored with the ending to the "" casablanca "" film , which he often watches on his video ( it could be said , that one of the film's themes could be about a beautiful friendship formed by a seemingly odd pair ) . the film comes replete with a happy ending , as noted onscreen by the ending saying just that . the two cats appear as the title and are seen constantly crawling in and out of scenes , sometimes contributing in a comical way to what is happening onscreen . the film is sometimes a "" keystone kops "" comedy , like those old mack sennett films . the film just ran too long , close to two hours , for a story that shouldn't have been longer than 90- minutes . the group of gypsies were mostly nonprofessional actors , colorful characters , with their mouths filled with gold teeth , and a screen presence that was absurd and defying in logic . this original film offered something different to see , for a viewer who usually doesn't get to see real gypsies onscreen . it's a noisy comedy , with a loud brass band coming in at any time during the film . it takes suspension of belief on the part of the viewer to stick with this one for its complete romp across gypsy land , plus the skits become too labored to sustain the frenetic pace of the film . the characters make this film enjoyable . the gypsies are real humdingers ; they are always grinning ; and , while acting grotesque , they seem to be cruel , and ridiculous . the warm moment in the film , is the romance between branka and florijan , vanishing in a field of sunflowers . she's a live-wire , and when onscreen was a commanding presence . "
221,"a fairly-routine ww11 action-packed film . the best thing that could be said about the film , is that it avoids a lot of the usual cornball war film clich ? s about the brotherhood between the troops . its rise in critical evaluation over the years , where it was once reviewed as a typical war movie but now because of siegal's rising star as a director , has been granted "" cult status , "" which resulted in receiving much higher praise than i think it deserves . what siegel did for this b&w film , along with ww11 expert robert pirosh , was tighten up the script , make it more suspenseful , and emphasized the psychological differences between the few men of the 2nd squad and the pyschopathological attitude of the mcqueen character . the film opens in montigny , france-1944 . after the men spot this , newhart goes into a telephone routine he used as a stand-up comedian , but only here it is not funny and seems out of place . this is a film that builds to a climax for its brutal payoff . the men seem to think that this makes sense . he won't do anything until he clears it with pike . pike in a friendly gesture asks reese : "" were you right ? "" reese responds : "" how the hell do i know . "" >from the film's title , you can determine how the film will end , as the men prepare to attack the german pillbox , strengthened by company reinforcements . the film can make claim to its antiwar sentiments by showing the insanity of the attack . for me it was just another war film , nothing special .

222,"there's not much in the way of thrills or surprises in this minor noir film , one that is able to combine a story about diamond smugglers and a smallpox outbreak in the new york city of 1947 . it is mildly diverting because of its able depiction of america's cold war paranoia during the early 1950s against anything foreign , as the film shows how an entire city can become terror stricken by something unknown attacking it . to make sure that you know that he is the heavy in the story , he will speak with a foreign accent . everything foreign in this film is either connected with something sick or with something dangerous to america . the action part of the melodramatic story was weakly told , while the noir characterizations of sheila did capture the desperate feelings of the subject , but it was not enough to overcome the overall inability of the story to have a heart to it . the mechanical acting by everyone , except for keyes , and the unconvincing action scenes made the film appear as the b film it was , despite the great noir camerawork of joseph biroc , who caught how dark the city could be for someone on-the-run . "
223,"this is a remake of clouzot's very memorable le corbeau . though not a complete failure , preminger's american version still managed to take most of the starch out of this bitter french chiller and make it seem dull and predictable . even i guessed who was writing the poison letters , and i'm not especially good at that sort of movie detective work . the film changes scenery from its original version in france and now takes place in a small-town near quebec , canada . the film opens by painting onscreen hollywood's idea of what a small-town looks and feels like , as the sun is shining , the mailman is cheerful and nosy , and everything about the town looks picture-perfect . pearson says it's nonsense . but laurent takes a more cautionary approach saying , "" you can't dismiss these letters completely , they are written by a psychopath , and they have been known to act against their own interest . "" spoiler : if you don't want to know who the poison letter writer is , skip the remainder of the review . the film lost its power and energy to be viewed as a true noir film , and ends up being more like a flat- 'who done it thriller . ' the force of its noir story never fully materialized under preminger's hollywood type of direction . the psychological motives of the couple were too murky to have much intellectual impact on the story . "
224,"this tolerable but not particularly interesting noir film suffers from a meaningless story , lacklustre direction , and even though , it has a good cast , the two glamorous stars , robert taylor and ava gardner , seem miscast : they are too beautiful for their parts . there was no conviction felt in the two stars succumbing to their pangs of love ; they brought little to the story in the way of true cynical noir feeling , and it is only the heavies , vincent price and charles laughton , who keep the film hopping with their stock villainous portrayals . the film , badly compromised by the romantic directions it headed in , was unable to pick up steam , until the finale , where there is a splendid shootout between taylor and price amidst a fireworks display . but by that time , the story seemed too trite to really matter , and its main theme about the moral dilemma of whether taylor should accept a lot of cash to look the other way or of letting ava go even if she was guilty , because taylor fell in love with her , seemed to hardly matter . he was the only one in the film who was even remotely interesting and who , along with price , seemed to be in the right film . "" the bribe "" was shot in the mgm studio and has a phony look to it and enough trite dialogue in it to put a few yawns on your kisser . say it often enough and its just a sound without any meaning , anymore . "" that could also describe this film , as it lost its purpose early on and never found any true meaning in its story . "
225," open your eyes  asks a lot of questions , such as : how do you know if you are awake or dreaming ? how do you know if you are sane or mad ? how do you know what is real or fantasy ? how do you know if you killed someone or not ? this stylish work , filmed in all the sleekness of a modern madrid inhabited by the affluent young , tells its jarring tale in a non-linear way , sure to confuse even the most avid moviegoer . he has the smile of a professional charmer and the warmth of a snake . if you like playing guessing games and are taken with the slickness of this bold but not exactly fresh script ( i've seen mind-games like this played-out in some recent films , including "" the game "" ) , then you will have a more favorable impression of the film than i did . i felt it tried to be interesting , and touched on many different genres , from romance to sci-fi , to tell its kafkaesque denouement , but it was not particularly a moving experience . i felt uninvolved , finding myself easily drifting into my own dreamworld , and as diverting , beautifully acted and photographed , and entertaining as the film was , i thought it was mostly about style and not ideas . "
226,"catherine keener , a normally interesting actress , has nothing to do in this role but whine and act drab . cage , at all times seems wooden , never relaxed in the role . it makes one nervous just watching him trying to act a role he can't seem to get the handle on . it just never came off that way , and for a number of reasons , not the least of them being , was that cage wasn't right for the part and that he was never seen in a reflective moment undergoing a life change . the dramatics here seemed misplaced , as if they were intended more for one of the director's batman flicks , something the director brought more life to than he did with this film . but this time the look seems artificial and not well-placed , as cage is not really an introspective person , he is just someone trying to make a better life for himself at a job he is good at . and that is the main problem with the film , it has a false gritty noir look to it . this film is not the real deal , it's ersatz . therefore it never works on the intellect , instead it attacks the emotions and cheapens its efforts by pretending to delve into cage's angst . even the credible camera work , which seems too sharp-edged for the film , works against it , because it is so much better than the story and the weak acting , that it highlights even more , how artificial the film seems . the heavies of the film are all personifications of pure evil . there is nothing good about them . poole is the contact and distributor of the film . velvet is the tacky artist ; he makes the films . velvet is considered to be the jim jarmusch of s&m films . the results are as gratituous as any found in a myriad of cheap adventure films that appeal to a ready made audience , not looking for a thinking picture . the box office mistake of this film , is that it took itself seriously , somehow believing itself a thinking picture , and thereby lost both types of audiences . because those who enjoy the exploitive gore films , must have found something lacking here also , like just enough thinking to turn them off from the film . the film had perhaps one line in it that didn't seem phony , when the masked killer is unmasked and says , "" the things i do--i do them because i like them . because i want to . i wasn't abused as a child . i don't hate my parents . '' it is everywhere . that dilemma might have worked as a morality play , if the acting and the story didn't seem so wooden and phony . "
227,"a sophisticated mid-victorian drama , told in the form of an allegory , about upper class society , playing more like a pbs special or a high-brow merchant-ivory film but with a darker secret to tell . it comments on the environment influencing one's behavior more than anything else , as the female protagonist is studying a colony of red ants attacking black ones . she is like the butterfly , so delicate and beautiful to behold . which refers to the servants , but might be the closest we come to anything resembling angels in this film . she chastises him one day by saying to him , "" you do not know if i am aged 30 or 50'' . if one can read his mind , he is saying to himself i shouldn't have married for looks . he also has a few children , whom he does not feel strongly about . the film was visually pleasing ; the costumes were beautiful ; the script was acceptably literate , and the film ably took the viewer into an antiquated world and its peculiar customs , where the many maids who worked at the estate turned their back to the wall in the presence of their betters , giving one some rough idea about life there . the problem with the film , was that it was tedious and had no emotional oomph to it . the acting was stiff . the pace of the film was lethargic . the most interesting sights were the insects themselves , which if that's your thing , it would be better to view on one of those nature shows public television has . overall , this film showed the dramatic events in too clinical a manner for it to be viewed as anything more than a competent production . "
228,"there will be no happy hollywood type of ending here . the film was mildly diverting , suffering from a weak storyline and trevor howard as the lead actor . he is too regal an actor to play a noir protagonist . what was gritty about the film , was the quick-cut editing , the magnificent black and white photography , and the keen direction . the film had a certain amount of distress coming forth from it characters and lots of brutal scenes , adding much suspense to the routine story . but the british films are no match to the americans when it comes to noir , this one being no exception . "
229,"what can i say about a film that was laugh-out-loud funny in spots , was driven by a fantastic performance by bruce willis as a contract killer , but was disturbingly vulgar ( the murder of an undercover cop is used as part of the comedy routine ) , except to say that it was driven by characters who seem to enjoy their work and working with each other . it was also a more palatable of a film than i thought it would be . these demented zany characters , not one of them who was without a blemished soul ( reminiscent of pulp fiction and analyze this ) , is a popular reworking of the gangster film into comedy , a phenomena of recent times worth taking note of in the gangster genre . the result is a film that gets over , more or less , as a parody . a film that is farcical and loopy , but leaves a lot to be desired . it still looks likes like a sitcom to me . the plot starts off simple and then becomes more complicated as more characters are introduced . she is disappointed that the likable oz can't make a good living out of his practice . he tells him he works for janni and after punching the dentist around offering some more excuses for sight gags and pratfalls , he brings him to see janni . the conversation from the heavily accented janni goes something like this , "" i yust hate yimmy . the british born director jonathan lynn ( my cousin vinny ) , after a so-far mediocre career , has become more skilled at pacing a film , as the non-stop action scenes make the film fly by quickly , which might actually be its best asset . this is lighweight entertainment and should work well if one chooses to overlook a flawed script , questionable values , and that there are no nice people in the film . but . . . the film is funny . "
230,"if there is one word that describes this conspiracy thriller , a take-off on the oklahoma city federal building bombing , that word is preposterous . this is a sloppily made film , imitative of the smoother made "" the parallax view . "" it lures you into thinking it has someplace to go , but after one coincidence too many and details that don't rationally add up , this film begins to soon feel like it has been weighed down with lead . there was never for one moment , after faraday looks at the plans of a mall project at lang's house and says that's not the mall , it's an office building , did i think that this was going to be a serious story . and that is one of the major problems with the film , it pretended to be serious yet it couldn't hold its end in the bargain and provide a story that made sense . it was a loopy story , with a somewhat promising beginning but a terrible ending . the lang's seem like a benign , suburban couple , easily smiling and engaging in small talk . tim robbins and joan cusack play the smiling but sinister couple until it becomes nerve-wracking to watch them try and pull this nonsense pose off , any further . the payoff comes in the film's last fifteen minutes , and it seems so artificial . the film is resolved in an incredulous fashion , as if it were trying to evoke a cry of sympathy ( ala oklahoma city ) for a tragedy that seemed acted out for symbolic purposes rather than portraying real people made up of flesh and blood . there is no possible way that scenario could work except in a move like this one . if you leave aside the unconvincing acting , the implausible story , its inane political views , then you might find this film somewhat entertaining and it may raise for you some pertinent questions about the fbi's handling of recent bombings . i just felt annoyed that the script tried to be too cute and i never warmed up to the way the film was indelicately handled . "
231,"brian de palma's idea of a thriller is short-changed as far as plot and substance in favor of style . he has created a silly but entertaining film , where one shocking scene tops another , and numerous hollywood cheesy gimmicks are used instead of relying on john farris' tightly drawn suspense story . tis a pity such crass commercialization should rule the day for de palma , instead of artistic integrity ! this follow-up to his commercially successful carrie , takes the director further into the ridiculous realm of demonic possessions and all that would imply to a hollywood director who is looking to make a popcorn movie . any hope for this being a plot oriented film soon goes down the drain and the movie turns into a horror film , with special effects galore , rolling demonic flashing eyes , and shocking scenes with blood and gore . how wonderful ! cassavetes is a great villain . but there's really not much in this film that is plausible , except a chance to escape from the world for two hours .

232,"it questions the military leader's decision not to even fire a shot , though outmanned and sure to be defeated , but offering no resistance or support to their countrymen . that seemed hard to believe , considering they had an armed force of some three thousand . the result is a straightforward , old-fashioned drama that shows his mettle and crustiness , in a film noted solely for his sterling performance . the film ably depicts the peaceful nature of the norwegian people and how they found war to be a very difficult position for them to be in , and how confused everyone was at the time , as there was a lack of leadership from the top . there is mass confusion and no strong leadership present there . but that doesn't stop the men from laughing at thor , who is dressed in his outdated uniform and is so much older than anyone else at headquarters . the last lieutenant doesn't have anything new to say , but what it says about one's loyalty to country and how its military leaders were faced with difficult decisions , was deftly handled by first-time director hans petter moland . it is a film for those who want to see a different approach to war films , one where the study of character is more important than the battle scenes and the arguments of ideology . the film told a decent story . it's only problem was , that it just wasn't that exciting a picture . "
233,"it takes too much of a suspension of reality to believe in this outlandish plot : the devil is in our heads and was placed there by ordinary contact with others ( it spreads like germs do ) , even though it is played with zeal and candor by denzel washington , who is the squeaky-clean super detective john hobbes . the film is basically a horror film teaser , trying to say something about azazel that it really can't say without sounding ridiculous . there is also heavy use of fuzzy camera images by the cinematographer to indicate that the devil was being photographed from his point of view . these shots of the devil's viewpoint were overworked into the script to the point of overkill . the film worked only on a superficial level , as light entertainment and should be given credit for , at least , attempting to have a literate script . it is basically an escapist film , that failed to build-up tension as the story went on . indeed , by the film's last scene , the story waned in interest , proving mosly that time wasn't on its side . thusly , we have all been duly prepped for the supernatural part of the story to follow . these scenes have a good feel to them as they are grounded in reality and capture the feel of the detective world hobbes inhabits . ms . milano , who conveniently happens to be a professor of theology , tells hobbes , "" if you value your life , if there's even one human being you care about , walk away from this case . "" by this time , the story lost its base of reality . the evil spirit that couldn't die moves from person to person , and there is a chase scene in a crowd where the possessed pursuer could be anyone , which was exciting to watch , but added little to the meaning of the story . denzel's noir-like voiceover seemed artificial , an imitation of how a real noir film operates . he was also not convincing as a noir protagonist , he seemed more like a cop who was in a horror movie but might have been better off being in a straight movie about a cop being framed by corrupt cops . the premise of the occult tale was too silly to take seriously . but the film plodded on , getting more ridiculous by the minute , until it ended on a note of surprise , in the twisted manner one expected a film like this to end on . "
234,"the film is done almost documentary-like , and it almost seems believable , as the actors are all straightfaced about what is happening . i've seen a lot of sci-fi films that didn't make as much sense as this one does . that doesn't mean that i think this b-film made too much sense . but it was bearable and it didn't try to sensationalize the monster's killing spree , and if you are not too fussy about the flat dialogue and the phony mexican accents heard , one might even find this film to be easy to take on a rainy saturday afternoon .

236,"the film's leaden pace and pancake look and wooden acting , are all major detractions . at least , he was lively and looked as if he was into the part . i'm not a believer in miracles , nor am i disbeliever in miracles . i just don't think an orthodox religion , one that demands blind faith and obedience from its members can find the truth about such spiritual matters ( that's why i'm a non-believer in orthodox religions ) . for me , a miracle is when someone overcomes their karma and finds enlightenment , and is able to be filled with love , living without illusions , who can convey this feeling to others and make the world a little better place to live in . the only proof needed for such a miracle is in the freedom felt from within , by the person experiencing it . but for those who are believers in the orthodox , needing some proof that god can hear their prays , then this serious-minded film with its lack of kitsch , supposedly , can shed some light how a saint is chosen and how miracles are documented by the church . but , unfortunately , the story is not able to overcome the handicaps of its plodding story and therefore it fails to materialize as a credible one . in my opinion , the process of choosing a saint is just as much political as religious , and the director waffled in which direction to go . in the end , she chose to cop-out , with one of those slick , unsatisfactory modern endings , which is contrary to the underpinnings of this very european-styled film . it results in a draw between the rivals within the church structure , and who feels satisified walking away from an event and not having a winner ! there is no rational explanation for this occurrence . this will be submitted to the church's upper echelons . the priest discovers he has a carnal interest in roxanna , which he is able to resolve , but it is done in such a banal way , with no chemistry between the two to justify their relationship , or does their relationship result in finding anything significant to say about a priest thinking like a man . is this too a miracle ? it was difficult to believe in the story or be absorbed in it , as the acting was stilted and the process of choosing a saint did not enlighten me as to what really happens in the church back rooms . i found it impossible to believe anything father frank found about helen would , necessarily , make her a saint , except for political reasons to satisfy the faithful . i don't know what i learned from this film , or what the film tried to deliver as a message . but i do know that the story failed to keep me from yawning , as i preferred the much more flawed recent miracle film , stigmata , to this one , even though this film had no kitsch like the other one did , but it also had very little movement and took few risks in the sober-minded way its story was told . so much for the intelligent telling of a story , if the story is not convincing . there would have to be a fourth miracle to get me to believe in this flick .

237,"an old-fashioned ww11 submarine movie made for men , featuring an all-male cast , played with a square jawed military call for patriotism . there are no jokes here , even though it could have used some to lighten its torpedo load . every move made in this film is seemingly life threatening , whether on a personal basis or because of the action scenes . but , aside from being as sober-minded as some of the classical films of this genre-- such as run silent , run deep , this is no wolfgang petersen's das boot ( 81 ) , the only excellent submarine film ever made thus far , but it is as thrilling and as contrived as the recent , big-budgeted crimson tide . this makes for a fairly entertaining but vacuous film , whose entertainment value , i estimate , to be in the middle-range of this genre . if you get your sea legs under you and don't mind the film's history being blurred and its insistence on making heroes out of the men at all costs , then you should find it viscerally challenging and not be underwhelmed by its clich ? s and its technical inaccuracies , as noted by other observers with far greater submarine technical knowledge than i have , who point out for example : you can't start a diesel engine in a submerged submarine . the stern-looking andy , contrary to his appearance and tight-lipped nature , is just too friendly with the crew and even though he's very competent and ambitious , he is told that his time hasn't come yet . predictably , you can figure out where the film is going with this subplot ! this matter is detailed in robert harris' novel enigma . the action is tense but hard to see what's clearly taking place , as death is happening quickly and each side looks like the other in the dark . the film has almost every expected submarine battle scene ever presented take place . it is directed with emphasis on sustaining suspense , building on the action scenes , and letting go full force with its special effects , making for a solid and exciting effort . though , to its down side , character development is the first casuality in this war film- it simply is not a top priority of the director for this nut-and- bolts actioner . the same could be said for dialogue , which consists mainly of drab submarine lingo . but i don't think this film has that something special that sometimes makes these easy-to-watch films into blockbusters . but it should do a brisk business in the box office , anyway . it is a film geared for the unthinking man that is well-crafted and impressive in carrying out its purpose to be about those who are efficient at doing their job and don't question orders . it's a change of pace from a lot of the current war films and a throwback to those old ww11 genre films , with perhaps , a new audience ready to take that leap back in time , and maybe , even an old audience , coming back to see a war that counted for something , at a time when values were much different , a time when such a full-scale war can be remembered fondly by an older generation , who know the price that was paid for the war effort by the loss of lives it cost .

"" i felt i was tricked once too often in this film , that with all its intended satire , it still ends up being a rather tasteless film that basically had not much of a point to it . this is , to say the very least , a disturbing film , even if it trimmed down on the novel's savagery and that the grisly killings take place mostly offscreen . it is a film about someone who is only human through his vices . while the film tries desperately to catch something about the psycho that an audience could sympathize with besides his good looks , but what results is that he can't be put together to look like a real person . and that is what becomes the main problem for the film , it is both creepy and sickly funny , but it offers no insights into a serial killer's mind-set that hasn't been said before . despite the film's glitzy photography , all the beautiful men in it , its various techniques used to make this a thought-provoking film , all fail to convince me that when all is said-and-done , this is not a sensationalized film , reveling in the subject's sickness and need for pornography and violence and consumerism . this is a superficial psychological comparison , and though it might sound good saying the two are alike , if you take the time to think about what is being said , it becomes easy to see that there are just as many similarities as differences between the two groups . the only other thing that i remember from the detective's role , is that dafoe has a deep , rich voice , as his part was miniscule and not very well thought out . the men in his life , all colleagues and look alikes , seem to be dressed-up as gentlemen but underneath that veneer , they are neanderthals . in one successful scene , that is an amusing satire on status among the corporate-types , his colleagues compare their business cards as to the texture of the paper and the quality of the printing . but the film's drawback , is that it is only about a general person and not about an individual , despite bale's tour-de-force performance and the aims of the director to get more out of the film than the book got . it still has an unpleasant subject matter to deal with and is only successful in making passing comments about a way of life that is easy to ridicule- the "" me "" generation . i might have liked the film better , if it had the balls to stick with its serial killer story , as difficult a task as that may have been , which is the heart of the story anyway , instead of yielding to so-called good-taste and accepting a lame hollywood cop-out ending ( which probably was a business decision more than an artistic one , since the film will now at least bring in some profit ) . the film left me with an empty feeling , by implying the psycho is still a psycho , even if the killings are not real . i certainly don't think music or books about serial killers makes them serial killers or do their repressed thoughts . i believe they are that way because they are driven by what's inside them that is uncontrollable and all that could be done in a film that is not made just for entertainment or exploitation , is to try and see if we can understand them a little better . i'm not sure if i can say that this film accomplished that and i'm not sure if i felt wholly entertained by the film , though the film was to its credit was not an exploitive one . yet , an empty feeling is what lingers , even long after i saw the film and try to recall it . other than the film looking good , being titillating in spots , being competently put together and well-acted , i don't think there is much else to say about it that is thought-provoking . "
240,"petulia plays like a soap opera , set in san francisco during the late 1960s . it has a few gratuitous shots of janis joplin and big brother & the holding company plus the grateful dead , playing to a largely non-hippie audience . it is , indeed , mind-boggling to have so little acid rock in a film pretending to be about the mod '60s . the film reminded me most of a general hospital sudser , with a few noted nicolas roeg cinematography tricks , pre-performance , thrown in to give it a deeper look than the picture merited , such as jump cuts , time frame changes back and forth and forward , leaving one with a disjointed feeling about when events actually took place . the innovations , which make the film seem unconventional , all come about through the visual rhythm of the film rather than through the story itself . the good thing about david's parents , is that the father is joseph cotten and it's always great to hear his uniquely rich voice on the screen . there is no explanation for the continuous flashbacks and flash-forwards , as confusion reigns as a form of hipness . if you ask me , i thought this film was more claptrap than anything else . but enjoyable claptrap . it was easy to take , and even if the story didn't go anywhere , it did catch something unique about the 1960s that wasn't seen in other films -- how the wealthy took to the changes without the usual ways of rebelling . she had a craziness about her that made her pause to take stock of her life , but not enough to be a drop-out . a socialite's kookiness , will you . george c . scott looked grumpy for most of the film , but seemed to gain a little of the revolutionary spirit of the times every time he was with the kooky petulia . aside from the brilliant performances , this surreal-styled film , with its successful flashbacks but not so successful flash-forwards , was rather a disorientated and emotionally cold film . it was impossible to warm up to these elusive and neurotic characters , each trapped by fate or indecision . by the film's end , the same problems that existed in the beginning were still present . george c . scott is still chasing something that he is not sure of . they all have quirky personalities , but they are all straight and it seems odd that a film so grounded in the '60s actually missed having truly representative characters of that age . i thought the film was too cutely done and lacked depth . "
241,"this chilling tale left a lot to be desired and despite having an intelligence and originality to it , it degenerated into a jejune work , more of a display of style over substance . i felt cheated by its wearisome ploy of not decifering what was a dream and what was reality , feeling more like i was being manipulated than i was at being treated to something special . in a positive vein , this low-budget film kept moving at a swift pace and the story was conceivable to a point . the film managed to hold my interest until about the halfway point , when too much of the same interplay between dreams and reality was never made clear , so much so that i stopped suspending disbelief , which is tantamount to pulling the life support on one of these flicks and rendering it brain dead . the slogan for the product would be : the new you from eunice . it is further explained to martin , that these are numbers we do not want to get into anyone else's hands . the proposition is , that we get you a meeting with him and you get to do brain surgery on him , and if you can manipulate his thought process so we get the three numbers we need , fine . but if he should go brain dead , that's fine too . as loopy as the story is from here , it is the most sense it will make , because everything gets more confusing from here on , after martin visits the harmless but paranoic halsey in lakeside . there are also dreams within the dreams , adding more confusion , until the film ends on a dull conventional note , after all the expections of something radical being promised . the film didn't do much for me , as it was not worth putting in all the effort to watch it , as the payoff seemed too little . but the dream sequences were scary and the film had an intelligent approach to its horror rather than the usual exploitive one . . . if only it made more sense ! pullman seemed believable as someone losing sense of reality , while paxton was robotic in his role , playing it without feeling . all the other performances were as forgettable as the film . "
242,"the other distinguished party in this revenge oater , is daniel b . ullman , a noted "" b "" western script specialist , whose unique stories were used in a multitude of westerns in that era . . . . if you want to see a western , one like they don't make anymore , this is as good a representative as most .

243,"quo vadis ? a glossy mgm extravaganza of a bible film , more pleasing to watch for its conspicuous opulence than for its dramatics , dialogue , or politics . petronius says of nero's lie , that people will believe any lie , if it is fantastic enough . quo vadis ? at the time , it was only second to gwtw in how much cabbage it brought in . it had a lot of spectacular shots and was well-paced , but it was not a particularly moving experience . one of the shots i preferred , was of nero looking through a a piece of green glass at an orgy while poppaea looked at it through a red glass . they had such different perspectives , you see . peter ustinov's delightful over-the-top sissy performance was fun to watch . they don't make them like this one anymore because it costs too much and the studios are not sure if the crowds will come again . "
244,"he assumes this will happen once he displays the bomb at the science fair and he also thinks , what could they do to me if i'm caught , i'm just a kid ! at the fair , the film breaksdown into a madcap thriller . unfortunately , only a few of marshall brickman's funny pearls get into the script . the one line i liked the best , is when lithgow is warning the kid about how tough the government agents could be when they grill you : "" they'll lock you in a room and then they'll throw away the room . "" the tense scene back in the science lab consists of all the usual melodramatics seen in most typical action films , but what makes this film a little bit different , is that there have actually been seven fatalities at nuclear plants across america , even though this information is not widely known by the public . i use as my source of reference , for this information , dr . michio kaku , professor of theoretical physics , at ccny . so even if the film sunk rapidly into the pits of a pointless preachy exercise about nuclear dangers , there still was something absorbing about these nuclear scientists seen doing their job . and it was , at least , not one of those awful summer teenager movies . in fact , the acting was quite good in spots , especially , by christopher collet ; he convinced me he was a smart kid , while john lithgow convinced me that he was a scientist with a warm heart . "
245,"she acts and looks a lot like gwyneth paltrow . the film runs needlessly on for over two hours and takes this story into many different areas concerning religious faith , personal goals , cultures , comedy routines , and romance , with too many themes for it to adequately cover . but this time with a slightly different twist ! the film spends a lot of energy going back and forth among these characters , trying to understand why they are all so upset . it shows him on two dates and both with results that were not as funny as they were intended to be . the film was only mildly pleasing for the following reasons : jenna elfman was too attractive and had too much of a sunny disposition for either rabbi or priest , therefore the romance part of the film never took off . the pace of the film was meandering , focusing too much attention on close-ups of jenna and the side-bar subplots that added nothing relevant to the story . the story itself , which tried to be cute and touch upon current controversies , added nothing new by its discoveries . the film stopped dead in its tracks when it took itself too seriously and a series of sermons were delivered about how ben stiller should resolve his love problem . for first-time director and all-around actor edward norton ( fightclub/ the people vs . larry flynt/ american history x ) , this was a curious film for him to choose to direct , since he chose one that is particularly lightweight , considering some of his acting roles have been in cutting-edge films , which makes you wonder where he's coming from . . the results are that the film is more awkward than controversial , more secular in spirit than religious , and it revisits grounds that are all too familiar and have been done far better by people like woody allen . that love wins out over faith , should surprise no one who has watched hollywood films over the years and how they love to give people the endings that make them feel-good , and most people feel-good when they see lovers who love each other be together in the end . the best one can say about this film , was that its heart was in a better place than its script . the worst that can be said about it , was that its responses to the controversies it brought up , were decided in too timid a way for the film to leave any impact . "
246,"there are no surprises in this oater , but it's watchable fare . it is surprising how soothing these lightweight films can be and how nostalgic they are for those of us who sometimes have a yen to recall the 1950s , thinking fondly back when films such as this one were regularly part of a double-feature . there are villains galore here . my favorite portrayal of one is by jeff corey . as brett now sides openly with lane . these scenes are action-packed . there's nothing special about this oater , nor is there anything terrible about it . but , by golly , you get to see the cavalry come riding in to save the day , and to me , that's when you know for darn sure that you are watching a genuine western . "
247,"a love letter to the cinema , as some well-known hollywood musical films are paid homage to , as well as orson welles' the magnificent ambersons , using the following quote from that film : "" in those days they had time for everything . "" the film is about his innocent autobiographical reflections , which are devoid of sentimentality and are emotially rich in seeing what influenced the child to be the kind of adult he became . what the film lacks in script and conventional production values , it makes up in poetical lyricism . what takes place on the screen is a series of close-ups of the child and allusions about the child's reactions to growing up , without any particular effort to tell a story . it makes for a different way of filmmaking , one that is plotless , that would have been marvelous if it weren't so boring at times . yet , there are shots that are memorable , making me want to applaud davies for the effort more than for the result . the film , like the reading of poetry , demands concentration on its visualizations and allows for the free translation of what is seen , as no explanations follow . the closing shot of the long day closes , is of a striking sunset in black & white images , which was very evocative , the suggestion being of how grinding this childhood period was for the child trying to come to grips with things , but now looking back at it , he can see all the beauty in it that was always there , and not the least , being the way his mother always had such a chipper attitude . there is a warm place in the film reserved for the standard contemporary pop music of the times , with such songs as "" i don't know why i love you like i do "" and , "" at sundown , "" which is sung by doris day ; judy garland sings "" over the bannister "" ; and , "" tammy "" is sung by debbie reynolds . "" the major problem with this experimental film is not the poetry or the wonderful images seen , but that it is not a fulfilling cinematic experience because we don't get to know any characters in the film with any depth and we are more or less left with snapshot impressions of what bud experienced rather than feeling we know him better than that . for those who have fallen in love with art films , this one might be better suited to your taste than to the general public's . "
248,"the film wavers between being a philosophical treatise on women and being about a woman's passions without resolving what any contemporary woman's magazine currently does ( this unresolvement can be seen in both a positive and a negative sense ) . the effort here is to push the film along shock value lines , of pushing it more into the lines of what a porno film does as routine . some of her revelations might surprise the opposite sex , as this film is helpful like a self-help book is meant to be . she makes no bones about it that she loves the carnal act . marie's best comment to this is , "" why do men who disgust us , understand us best . "" she seems to enjoy this perverse relationship , of being degraded , better than all her others , as we see her with robert in this situation twice . despite the film's coldness , lack of humor , bleak conceptions about relationships , unappetizing sexual scenes , lack of dramatic tension , and pretentious philosophizing by caroline ducey , it still had something disturbing to say about relationships that was worth listening to . for the director , sex is shown to be what fantasies are made of : that it is all in one's head . to show this , breillat her heroine be nude for many scenes and therefore symbolically stripped her of all the illusions she has about sex , as we watch her act out these fantasies . though the film might not always be appealing , it is still not a work of trash ; it does have something to say of what goes on in the marital bedroom . how much you like what it says might depend on what you thought it was digging at and if its romantic notions rang a bell in your head . my thoughts are that the film's presentation didn't particularly excite me , but afterwards it left me thinking about what it had to say about relationships , which are still just as great a mystery as god is , and i began to warm to the film more than while i was watching it . it , somehow , made me think more about the dark side of a relationship and for that reason alone , i wouldn't entirely dismiss this film , though i wonder at what it really was trying to get at . the body of the film's works is quite different than its ending , which shows ducey giving birth to a son and her womanhood supposedly being fulfilled . i think this is a film women might be more appreciative than men . "
249,"a more than adequate telling of the standard-type of 1950s hard-nosed war film , which is helped greatly by an outstanding cast . throughout the film , starting at its opening moments , the patriotic "" halls of montezuma "" song is rousingly played whenever there is a call for flagwaving . lewis milestone , the director of this ode to war film , was curiously enough , noted for directing in 1930 , one of the most reknown anti-war films , all quiet on the western front . in "" halls of montezuma , "" milestone emphasizes the lives of the characters in the battle-tested 2nd marine company , rather than the battle scenes . in some battle scenes , the real documentary war shots are added to the film action , which gives the film a gritty look . the film doesn't pretend to be more than a routine ww11 war film reflecting the political mood of when it was made , that should be pleasing for those who like simple-minded action flicks . it is well-crafted by milestone's even-handed direction and it ably presents the characters of the men and lets the story build in action after a slow start , so that when some of the men die , you at least know who they were . "
250,"this routine noir feature just doesn't cut it -- it's story is too implausible and it lacks proper tension . what gives this opening scene its noir look , is the shadowy photography james wong howe provides in scott's escape through the window . this whole scene was really unconvincing , but , nonetheless , he manages to continue to charm the mother ( servoss ) . but things happen very fast and hilda can't wait for that meeting . the story simply didn't add up , but its quick pace helped move things along , and faye emerson and zachary scott can always be counted on to give competent performances . but nothing can save this film from mediocrity , as the film made a febrile attempt to study a psychopath , but was restrained by the film's weak script and lacklustre directing effort . "
251,"an entertaining nonsense film from aip , directed by the master of the meaningless , edward l . cahn . it is one of those mad scientist in the jungle movies , that is so bad , that it becomes funny to watch to see just how bad it is . there's some savagely inane dialogue , which should add a chuckle or two . he replies , "" never say that again . "" and with dialogue like that and cheap looking props , as the film was obviously shot as cheaply as possible in the studio , there is no reason in the world to take this flick seriously . it makes no attempt to make things look realistic , and its story doesn't even try to make sense . she says , "" what's in it for you here , the usual ! if you can accept the film on it own low level terms , this studio jungle film might be your medicine . "
252,"this howard hughes rko film first previewed with the title "" i married a communist , "" but this title did not strike a chord with the audience , so the title was changed and the story reworked so as to make it more of a palatable melodrama than just a vituperative attack on the communists . but it still remains to be seen as mostly a propaganda movie . he seems to have turned over a new leaf with this work experience -- as the film makes a concerted effort to show that work is good for you , that the bosses are benign , that the union can only succeed if it roots out the few commie operators in it who are trying to subvert its legitimate aims , that the communist party is the devil , and that you can't hide from your past mistakes -- so you better think about what you are doing before you sign up for a communist membership , because you can never get out of it once you join . the story was a lot of hokum and misinformation : it distorted the communist influence in the country and how big business and unions act . it attempted to make a propaganda film that reaffirms the american way of life and familial love , but at the expense of reality . if you can somehow get by the polemics and the cheesy script and view this melodrama as typical hollywood , the film is quite entertaining , as it is shot in a dramatic noir style by musuraca and the leads all give able performances , swallowing some of the most tasteless lines ever with a great deal of bravado . "
253,"this thriller is directed by doug jackson ; it will best explore the fast-paced business world and its sterile atmosphere , where not telling the truth or stretching the truth in different ways is the norm . it succeeds in capturing that frenetic yuppie need for material things and how that greed blinds the quality of life . but what it fails to do , is build a mystery that goes beyond what could be read in the newspapers . you get a few spine tingling moments out of the heroine's self-made misfortunes and a surprise twist in the ending , but you don't get a lasting sense that this isn't all manufactured tension to fit too neatly into its premise of how anyone can be a victim of a random act of violence and have their life put through the ringer . his most revealing comment is , "" i love to surround myself with beautiful things . i love beautiful women , smart , and powerful women . "" the the film became difficult to watch from here on . it was hard too warm up to her plight , though it was remotely possible to see how she got into this messy situation . the script was too thin and had to be padded with too many non-involving scenes . the film annoyed me more than it enlightened or entertained me . there didn't seem anything special about the acting and too many of the secondary characters were put in there as props to echo the director's point he was making of greed influencing corporate decisions . it didn't have the suspense of a hitchcock film , instead it had more the look of a second-rate movie made for tv , which could be entertaining for a late night audience that is not that demanding . "
254,"siegel misfired with this mild western comedy . the film was hampered by a dull story and an uninteresting performance by shirley maclaine playing a nun hiding the fact that she's a prostitute . a typical eastwood cowboy scene , played in clint's graceful languid style , as he puffs on his cigar , quietly snarls , and does what the filmmaker hopes most in the audience would love to do in real-life . once inside , they machete the soldiers , make them into human torches , or just shoot them . it's all predictable and formulaic ; it could have used a big time rewrite . "
255,"this is carl reiner's cleverly adapted spoof on noir films of the post-world war11 days . the comedy film relies on creative editing of the classics of the forties , somehow including a host of stars from bogart to cagney to ava , as part of its story . any scene could have martin conversing with someone like a cary grant or a veronica ladd , or being shot at by alan ladd . this is basically a one-idea film , and that idea , although cleverly worked out as far as special effects , begins to run dry after a while , as the story lags in character development . but enough's enough ! what keeps the film hopping are some very funny quips and some dumb bon mots that were infantile but amusing . 2 because it smelled like that number . if you've seen "" the bribe , "" you've got the rest of the film's story , as the reiner team ran out of ideas and winged the ending the lazy way , with old film clips . nazis and cheese go together in this film like vincent price to villainy . a knowledge of some of the more popular noir classics like the big sleep , double indemnity , and suspicion , might help in soaking up the films' nostalgia . the overall effect is not bad for a few belly laughs and to marvel at the skills of 1980s technology , but no cuban cigar for the film , as the story went up in smoke somewhere over the hills of hollywood . "
256,"a routine aip action-packed ww11 drama of heroism . if you like a no-nonsense war story of all action , no big-name stars , and one that validates courage . . . you got it in this solid low-budget actioner . "
257,"a breezy , screwball comedy about police , with a slightly different twist , it is about nyc's bureau of missing persons . so the story's not perfect ! but this was a fun programmer , fast-paced and a typical warner bros . potboiler of that time period . "
258,"a taut little suspense programmer . one that is very watchable , though the twist in the plot is hardly believable . it's not believable that a hardened hitman would confess so easily , but he does . . . what this potboiler had going for it , was a nice look to its b&w shots of the dark streets of london , and through sydney tafler's melodramatic performance , it showed how a killer can be cold-blooded taking care of business and yet be a devoted family man and , though his love for his brother was genuine , it was still misguided . overall , the "" b "" film had good production values and a satisfying but improbable story to tell . "
259,"we know we are watching a shaft movie without even looking up at the screen , as we tune into the wah-wah funk sound of isaac hayes' exponential title theme and get with its raucous sounds that echo throughout this action-packed mainstream movie from the opening credits to the film's end . john singleton's ( "" boyz n the hood "" ) "" shaft "" is a blaxploitation sequel film to the core , made in earnest for the urban new millennium and to satisfy its fans who have followed all the other shaft films . why do we need another "" shaft , "" is easy to explain : the public demands it , meaning there's big box office potential . his humor is of the vulgar kind , where he tells a barmaid , "" it's my duty to please the booty . "" the film has its two eyes firmly set on the box office , its mind in the gutter , and a serviceable script for all its mayhem and profanity to have an urban gritty feel to it . the film makes only a few halfhearted pretences of being anything more than a mindless entertainment spectacle , and those efforts don't help but hinder . the film would have been better served if went completely either for mindless violence or played it completely like a scorsese art-form gangster film . mixing in both styles , only jarred the rhythm of the film . it also had the audience where i saw the film , charged-up for the action scenes and hooting with wild delight at the snide digs . the meeting of great minds , of the hateful wasp walter and the stereotyped lowlife peoples , who speaks a stream of constant trash-talk and with an enunciation that is so fantastically off kilter , that makes it fun to laugh at him . the comedy provided by wright's speech pattern is comparable to a cisco kid movie dialogue , if the two stars were on speed . his role is very serious . he's limited in this lifetime by his ethnic quirks . the film resorts to violent chases , shootouts , a final duel between wright and jackson , and a twisted ending , to make its final statement about what singleton thinks of the justice system . it is stylishly directed and acted , and achieves moderate success in telling its story . it even offers some passing comments about a host of recent nyc police corruption cases , and it can't resist a passing aside at the current mayor , as jackson in the middle of an assault on the drug dealers says , "" it's giuliani time . "" this film was made for samuel l . jackson ; just by his presence , it makes this film a more perplexing one than the others . what is missing is any love interest or any sex scenes ; what takes the place of sex , is pure violence . you tell me if that's an improvement ! "
260,"the dinner game is such a scenario . some might find this fast-moving play to be smart and witty . but i didn't . he does that mainly through phone conversations , whereby he has a knack for saying the wrong thing and making things worst . jacques villeret is an appealing fool , whose good-heart shines throughout the farce , even though he proves to be a true numbskull . there were a few laughs to be had , but this is really tv sitcom material and not great wit . "
261,"there have been very few films about the american revolution and most of them have been terrible , with the exception of d . w . at least , they kept it moving at a brisk pace , but , unfortunately , they used a good deal of violence . there were a multitude of choreographed battle scenes , face-to-face combat scenes , and sweeping panoramic shots of the beautiful countryside , which should take your mind off all the empty messages of the film . the filmmaker even made slavery appear as not such a bad thing by having the slaves seem more like workers than slaves , they just seemed to be having themselves a good old time on the plantation . when the 158-minutes are up , you might not have much of an historical perspective of the war , but you should feel good that the arch villain got his just desserts . the colonel's villain role is about as one-dimensional and predictable as it gets for such a villain , whereby he becomes more cartoonish and less menacing as the story rolls on . and there you have the plot , which is not much on history and not much on character development . everything is so predictable about this glossy photographed film , everything is so banal , everything seems so dishonest , and the dialogue is so disparaging , that i found this to be such a morbid attempt at history , such a futile way to tell a story . everything from the acting and the script was flat . everyone was reduced to a cardboard figure , and the war seemed to be a manufactured one , as if this film was made as a tv episode . the story lacked vitality , only scoring points for its fine costumes and john williams musical score . the film always seemed to be an unhealthy mixture of mawkishness and carnality , offering nothing but shallow responses for all its preaching about freedom . only this film comes with some bogus history lesson thrown in , which makes it more shamefully exploitive , a "" payback "" with the redcoats as the gangsters . i had an ugly feeling when i left the theater , like someone was trying awfully hard to sell me on patriotism : using children , the flag , a horrid villain , all to shamelessly stir me up , instead of telling me a story about a credible character who got involved in the war for independence . "
262,"drew pearson narrates the opening of the film , despairing about slums as the cause of juvenile delinquency . drew pearson's serious voice gives this film a documentary look ; and , when we see the gang in action , it is remindful of all those dead end kids' feature movies . this is a tired , clich ? d film , with its main selling point being all the location shots of the city , evoking a sense of urban nostalgia . tony curtis made his film debut , taking a small part as one of the amboy dukes . all the gang members are stock characters and the predictable story sheds little insight about juvenile delinquency , offering only a square look into the grimness of street life . this film lost everything about the novel that was essential , and the robotic acting didn't help . the only thing diverting about the film was some of the odd touches : the candystore lady insulting her customers while dispensing egg creams , and one of the dukes called crazy ( shelley ) , who is thinking about ordering ice cream mixed with french fries and potato salad , musing that it should taste good together , after all he likes all those foods separately . "
263,"a very familiar crime story , one that has been often done in recent times , about a rough irish neighborhood and the hoods who can't escape from it . first-time director john shea has made this independent low-budget film , that is long on gritty atmosphere but short on substance . it's a violent film , where action speaks louder than words . there doesn't seem to be a point to this film , except to show some tough guys in action , and how difficult it is to stop old habits . the acting is good enough and the background music , a mixture of rap , rock , and celtic sounds , evokes a sense of irish doom . but , the story fails to build any drama into it , and everything seems too bleak . it is an easy film to take on its terms , if you want to take a look at such a dead-end of possibilities and watch a dysfunctional family spin out of control . it reminded me of "" monument ave . , "" which covered the same territory . it was just too difficult to understand how that could happen considering the hatred between these two is known throughout the community and how danny swore he wouldn't do anything dishonest anymore . there are no surprises here , everything goes down a path to nowhere . since the film has no final note to end on , it uses the st . paddy's day parade to have its final shot--which is tantamount to waving the flag to indicate patriotism , or in this case , irish pride .

264,"i was never a comic book fan , though as a child i was a casual reader of such comics as archie , batman , and superman . i have never read x-men , which was created in 1963 , or for that matter too many other comic books as an adult , and therefore do not view this $75 million special-effects dominated film with the same reverence that an aficionado of such sci-fi fantasy comics would . i'm just interested to see how fox's new comics-to-film adaptation presents itself , as i found very few such projects turn out to be worthwhile films . the results here are only tepid , as far as entertainment value goes . other than that , i had no interest to see if the filmmaker made a travesty of the sacred comic book , as i'm certain x-men geeks will carefully scrutinize that aspect of the film more than i will care to . it is a commercial film , geared to be a summer blockbuster , also hoping to cash in on selling its merchandising wares to its young fans , and cashing in down the road with a number of sequels . its special effects were , at times , dazzling , but i'm not partial to high tech films without too much else going for it , especially for a superhero film that seemed as awkward as this one was . i only ask : why was the filmmaker so sober-minded about filming this comic book story film ? what seems tiring about it , is all the other characters in the film who are given quality time and end up just showing us their supernatural gifts and halloween-like costumes before disappearing from any further characterizations . the story , before it reached its action climax on the statue of liberty at ellis island , where the world leaders are convening , hit a lot of tired spots , where the movie seemed to be more or less a promo for more sequels than one that could sustain its own story . the premise of x-men is -- that its heroes are mutants -- homo superior beings -- the next evolutionary stage for human beings , who are discriminated against because they're strange . for most of the film , we are introduced to the opposing sides of this good versus evil duel . he can scale walls and has a 12-foot projectile tongue . wolverine is a hothead , a loner , and the existential hero of this film . his claws project out rapidly from his knuckles and can cut through almost anything . it is obvious that singer developed a love for this comic book story and its mutants , but he failed to distance himself from it and ended up with a ponderous , uninteresting film , that failed to get to the heart of any character in the story , and left the story hanging by its special effects , which made the film seem dried out long before its action scenes took hold . it was only mildly diverting as far as entertainment value and that is because of the welcomed hammy performances by stewart and mckellen . i'm sure that regular fans of the comic book will find some inside jokes in the film to laugh at , but i just tended to grow weary of the effort and was not converted to the x-men project . the film needed a healthy share of irreverence to rev me up for all this righteously moralistic stuff it lays on you .

265,"this disney presentation of a time travel fantasy tale has the good sense not to try and spend too much time clearing up what theoretical scientists say is impossible : it is not possible to go back to the past and change history . "" the kid "" is a children's story but is stretched into an adult one as well . it is usually through dreams , drugs , one's creative work , psychoanalysis , or meditation that one looks back at their past , but bruce is too blocked for any of that . if one were to overlook all the impossibilities about this story and just concentrate on how the bruce willis character comes to resolve his problem , then the film is somewhat engaging . though , it is sad to say that he resolves his problem the typical macho way , by beating up his nemesis . the movie was ably directed by jon turtletaub ( while you were sleeping/phenomenon ) and written by audrey wells ( the truth about cats and dogs ) . it has a balanced mixture of adult sentimentalities and childish comedy that should bring both children and adults into the same movie theater , each finding something in the film to experience together . the idea of the film is intriguing , of a man who will live his future as he knows he should because he got to the bottom of what troubled him when he was growing up , and though the story is impossible and the self-absorbed bruce is now learning to be nice to those close to him that he has hurt before , seemed like a stretch , it is still a family-fare film with a few more ideas thrown in than the usual disney flicks . though this type of supernatural movie has been tried often ( back to the future/frequency/12 monkeys ) , this film had a nice quality to it , making it rather special . bruce willis works very well with children , he seems to be a natural , and all his previous films with children also attest to this , including his recent supernatural thriller "" the sixth sense . "" "
266,"a mindless psychological thriller set in vermont , that starts out in a promising mysterious fashion but ends badly , ruining any credibility it might have generated . it tries very hard to be both a mystery and a supernatural story , but it goes off course on both its aims way before it sinks to its low abyss . it was a film that was all foreplay but couldn't come to a climax , and as the film started to clear up the mystery mood it created while moving at its snail pace , the revelations of the mystery weren't worth exploring . the only thing the film did well , was provide a lot of schlock . the result is a dull film , with uninteresting and poorly developed characters , and too many manipulative fright scenes that i have seen before in too many other horror flicks . the only thing this film did really well aside from all its schlock setups , was photograph the lakeside lake champlain area and use the champlain bridge for some eerie shots . the story seemed to drag from the onset , as the director wasted time taking irrelevant long shots aimed to be frightening and then turning away from those shots without drawing anything out of them ; it should have been an eighty minute film , like the b- movies of the 1950s , and then it might have been a more tolerable venture . robert zemeckis ( "" forrest gump "" / "" contact "" / "" back to the future "" ) is such an emotionally empty director , his characters seem more like robots than humans , that the movie seems to be such an effort in draining the life out of it that it becomes mostly a special effect movie with characters becoming secondary in importance . zemeckis has built a story around a lady-in-peril , one with too much idle time , who is overwrought with a healthy dose of neurotic tension , talking herself into thinking she sees ghosts , but who doesn't know how to internalize that fright . michelle pfeiffer is asked to carry this film , but without an adequate script , even if she is a good casting decision for that role , her task is too difficult to accomplish . the last shocking scene takes place in a bathtub , one that could have been ordered from the sears catalogue before world war 11 , and seems to be ready-made for a horror flick . if this is supposed to be like a hitchcockian thriller , then why wasn't i thrilled by what i saw ! zemeckis has created an unaffecting haunted house thriller , with samples from many other films thrown into this derivative stew , but nothing seems to work here . this is just a boring movie about a couple that are as unreal as the ghosts in their house . "
267,"this innocent comedy from spain just didn't have enough impact to hit a home run with its humor . it probably has more relevancy for its native audience ( at least , i hope it does ) , as most of its tv sitcom sketches just didn't register with my domestic comedy/romance antenna . the film's main asset is its popular star , carmen maura , considered by many spanish film critics to be spain's most accomplished actress . if you like that sort of comedy , then you might like this film . the story is probably autobiographical : the heroine ( carmen maura ) is a journalist named carmen , and the film is layed out in four sections , just like a newspaper , but here the divisions relate to the time of season . all the fights are mild and over the most trivial of things , which is supposed to make this very materially comfortable couple look ridiculous , since it is obvious that they have so much going for them that there is no reason for them to be fighting all the time . she then tells him , "" the watch only looks expensive , it was really quite cheap . "" somehow the film flew by , aided by its breezy pace , non-stop banter , and the lightheartedness of its direction . it was a sweet , palpable , likable little domestic comedy , similar to what american audiences saw on tv in the 1950s and 1960s ( except for the nudity and frank sexual talk ) . carmen maura put on a good show , outwitting the episodic script and coming to terms with her great mid-life crisis in a pleasing manner . it's a mild film , with mild comedy , and mild points to make about domestic relations . it is deserving of mild praise for its execution .

268,"what i didn't need was australian director/writer of "" cedars , "" scott hicks ( "" shine "" ) , to tell me what a bad thing the internment of japanese americans during world war ii was for a little over two hours of a darkly photographed film and then precede to bore me to death with a glum romantic/courtroom drama , that never got untracked , but seemed so proud of itself for being so politically correct in taking a stand against bias . all the film's great social themes and plays on morality , were too docile and too manipulatively inflated to hold my interest . the first part of the film , just stagnated , as uninvolving flashbacks filled the screen and uninteresting storytelling techniques prevailed , without fleshing out the reality of the characters except to see them in wooden terms . everything seemed so contrived , the film had no fresh air to breathe , the cinematography was darkly uninspiring , the courtroom seemed to be staged only as a reason to give the filmmaker his chance to applaud himself for being so free of bias . everything seemed so mechanical : the acting , the story , and the directing ; everything was so dutifully right , the film left me asleep in the cedars , as i was unable to see what the fuss was about in telling americans that their country shamefully put japanese americans in internment camps during the war . what's the surprise ? "
269,"matthew harrison's "" kicked in the head "" has its offbeat comical moments but in the end dies from self-indulgence and too much cuteness . kevin corrigan wrote a juicy part for himself , but his part never caught fire , in fact , he was the film's weakness . the supporting characters were at least funny when they did their shticks in this rambling , derivative nyc movie , that tried too hard to be offbeat and in the process forgot it would be nice to have a story that made some sense to go with the film . when she does that , it is good for a few laughs . the film gets trapped in too many scenes that don't work . another is the unlikely romance taking place between corrigan and fiorentino , which seemed out of context , and added nothing to the story , except it was more pleasant watching fiorentino perform than it was in watching corrigan . she was so much better than him , that it made me scratch my head and wonder what he was doing there . her character was all the more compelling than his , even though she had such a small part . nothing seemed to really work well here , yet all the supporting characters seemed to be pleasant and trying their best to make things work . but the film was too much of a childish fantasy on the part of corrigan , and the dialogue was too flip . it was one of those films that you might find enjoyable if you are in the right frame of mind for watching actors improvise their way out of a bad script , or if you are stoned like the connoisseur participants in "" ape "" film conversation were . "
270,"the problem with epics of this grand design , is they could never be dramatic enough and fall prey to episodic incidents to tell their story . that is the case here , as the story was leaden and didn't seem to move , as it plodded along linear lines and political regimes , from monarchy to fascist and finally to communist regimes . the filmmaking , though well-intentioned and intelligently presented , was just too dull and uninspiring to sustain interest in the lesson it is trying to teach about the mess bigotry and politics makes , even if the lesson is an important one and shouldn't be ignored . the film was also bereft of any subtlety , its messages were of the kind that hit you over the head with a loud thud . there are a few scenes that stand out because they were either so awkward , or because they had a raw power in them that was not found in the rest of the film . the drivel that comes out of that dialogue goes something like this : "" i love you . . . but the point being made , in all the belabored efforts of the filmmaker , is that political regimes , materialism , and all causes are temporary , and that religions tend to be divisive . the film shows how assimilation can't work , changing your name can't work , being a good family and trying to be loyal to an oppressive regime can't work , passivity can't work , there is nothing that the jew can do to make those who hate him like him . i felt drained after seeing this epic , not from joy , but from weariness of all the messages i was receiving . he goes on to say , "" i predict this will be a century of love , justice and tolerance . "" this was the only irony found in the film , a film that just couldn't get its complex view across on what went went wrong for the jew in the anti-semitic world of austria-hungary , without being a drudge . "
271,"a too obvious derivative supernatural thriller , most imitative of "" rosemary's baby , "" but without the same fresh intensity and without a credible script . what it had going for it , was a sleek look ( the cinematography was simply out of this world ) and an able workmanlike craftsmanship . rand ravich does a fine job directing his initial film , but fails miserbly with the storytelling part of his script . this results in a film that is watchable but not believable . in this arty mystery , which doesn't have too much mystery if you watched a few of these supernatural films before , spencer and streck come back different men from what they were before they experienced the two minutes of mystery . without a mystery to end on , the film becomes banal , having established no point of view and having nothing to say about space travel , it just becomes a predictable guessing game of how jillian will defend herself against her husband , someone who is really not her husband . "
272,"this film is all style and is non-judgmental in its observations , adding nothing more of subtance to the story than the inertia that is depicted . there is violence everywhere in this stupid household . the film had realistic performances from its leads and had a gritty look to it . but the story flattened out and with violence being the loudest emotion expressed by anyone in this loser's family , the story predictably ends on a very violent note . the film makes no comments about the conditions of a society that helped bring about such anti-social behavior and what circumstances kept the family incapicitated . this first feature by woods , based on a work that was presented on stage , had its powerful moments , making a strong case about how male insecurity and violence are so closely linked . but the film couldn't get further into its subjects than to expose the boys' surface wounds and their bleak story about their frustrations to deal with life , as the story just went nowhere but down a predictable violent path . it left the implication that society better be prepared to build more jails or else , implying that there is no way to help a family that won't even lift a finger to help itself . "
273,"wild party , the ( director : dorothy arzner ; screenwriters : from a story by warner fabian ; /e . a zesty college girls film , that is trashy fun , with the trash part of the film being very mild and the wild party being rather tame . despite its limitations , this film is a curious curio , it is mostly interesting to watch clara bow , the "" it "" girl , a superstar from the silents make her entrance into talkies and have the longtime editor for paramount pictures , dorothy arzner , be given the opportunity to direct that studio's first talkie . instead , he treats her curtly , not amused by her lack of work , lecturing her in class about her poor work habits . march's rationalization is , if i have to pass her , i'll pass all the other idiots in the class , as his main concern is that his course will now become known as an easy one . march's attitude about the college is summed up with this rejoinder to clara , "" no more morons but plenty of savages . "" this film can't be taken seriously , as its moral tone is questionable , its depiction of college life absurd , and its characterizations are all trivialized . but the film was snappy , a frivolous vehicle for the very appealing , good-time girl clara , who comes through with a heart of sweetness , while march shows he is more serious about the jungle than the university . "
274,"this is an awkward comedy made just before kurosawa's breakthrough film , rashomon . but hiruta is not reliable , as he explains himself , saying people used to take advantage of him and laugh at his weaknesses , so he now uses trickery on them and doesn't care about ethics . the film switches tracks , as the two leads are not particularly interesting types , but the flawed hiruta makes for a more compelling story , so he becomes the main focus of the film . the courtroom is filled with contrivances , as the story befits a tacky soap opera . you can't beat that for pouring on the goo ! supposedly this film is a parody of the japanese willingness to accept america's foreign culture as theirs . kurosawa is an overrated director outside of shooting an action film , who can't shoot a dramatic film without laying on an overdose of goo . here he has mifune and the concert singer become sexless , while the publisher becomes a stock cardboard villain , and the lawyer's fall and redemption are just too predictable to have any effect . there is something caustic in this story , but its overall effect is ruined by too much that is an obvious delineation of what is good and evil . i found the message awkwardly delivered and unconvincing , and the acting was especially bad , as the lines as rendered seemed to be mechanical and not instinctive , it was as if all the actors attended a school for bad actors and learned to act by being didactic . this film hardly had a pulse , just a message it kept sending out in a not too subtle way . "
275,"i expected this film , given its clich ? subject matter , to be worst than it turned out . in fact , it had its moments in the snow of actually looking like pure cinema . jacques tourneur should be credited for making this wartime propaganda piece into an acceptable action film , shunning politics for a typical hollywood wartime heroics and romance story . the film presented new and unknown actors , and only one of them , in his first motion picture , after appearing on the broadway stage , gregory peck , had any kind of star quality . need i say more on how she got the part ! but to her credit , she handled the role decently . this film was a ringing tribute to our wartime allies , the noble soviets . this would be a source of embarrassment in the coming years . the film predictably plods along to its climax , as nina delivers a message to the russian general in the field and he gives her a coded message , which is the one peck was waiting for , as he gets just as excited about the message as he does about holding nina in his arms . the film failed miserably with the critics and at the box office , but it wasn't that bad . . . it even had a certain corny charm to it that some might find appealing . "
276,"everything seen is what has become a clich ? for this genre . i missed you . the film ends smoothly like those mystery shows on tv do : with a car chase that seems to be obligatory filler for such cop films , a rescue coming just in the nick of time , and the action scenes being well choreographed to fit the pyrotechnical finale . the attempt to bring any psychology into this thriller , never materializes , except in the most banal manner . in fact , the killer is more interested in playing mind games with spader than he is in killing his victims , which convinced me that this film wasn't looking to go into new territory with this 'let's make a profit for the producers' genre film . this debut feature by the music video director joe charbanic is a limited venture , smacking of formula questions and answers to the serial killer's mental state , resulting in a picture that is decidedly painted by-the-numbers . james spader as the lead , most of his career a fine actor , has difficulty doing anything with his uninteresting and predictable role , except go with the props he's been handed . the film covers up its banal story by some pretty slick shooting devices , which include fast-paced editing and jump-cuts , and at times , when taking on the killer's point of view , making the beautiful color go grainy with a hand-held video camera , which is meant to signify that there is some kind of mystery going on . what the sleek looking film accomplishes , is that it makes this hollow film very watchable , looking much like an mtv video . the film ultimately fails because the story is never drawn out enough to make it spellbinding or tense , the main characters are both too hackneyed to bring something to the table except an exercise in playing a role that goes against their film career typecasting . "
277,"this lighthearted fantasy asks , what if the idealist h . g . wells didn't just write about the time machine but lived it ! it's mainly an emotionally flat , one running joke type of lightweight literary film that is done in by a very dull middle section and too much unnecessary gore . the director-writer nicholas meyer ( star trek 11 ) -- he also wrote the witty novel "" seven percent solution "" -- worked the screenplay from his own novel , showing some clever touches here and there , but not enough to hold my interest for the duration of the film . the theme grew tiresome and david warner as jack the ripper never developed as a particularly interesting villain . there was nothing gained by seeing him hold a scalpel to a woman's throat and then slit it . if you don't have the key , you can't return . in san francisco , there are some amusing moments as the naive wells has to adjust to the modern complexities of the world and its hustle and bustle . he seems adorably old-fashioned and gentlemanly , with a very stand-offish british wit , while she's an aggressive woman's libber , a modern california-type of lady , and an admirer of british eccentrics who are straight . it just advanced in technology but regressed into a more violent state than ever before . the film has many plot holes and flaws , one of them is : that it is not possible to go back in time and change history , all one can change is something that is only a duplicate , even if you think you are changing something , you are only deceived by appearances . albert einstein mentioned that about time travel and that's good enough for me . the jack the ripper part of the story never really worked as a thriller , it all seemed too heavy and misplaced , i am certain the film could have been salvaged if it kept with the fantasy/romance story between amy and wells . that part of the film was amusing and gave way to some interesting insights about the modern world . the film suffered from being too poorly presented , as it always appeared less than exciting , nevertheless it was occasionally diverting , and some cult sci-fi fans might like it more than the general public should . "
278,"this is a lame coming-of-age film , yet michael corrente directs it with great sympathy for the characters , taking a lighthearted approach to some mild rebellion going on in the mid '70s , contrasting the lifestyles of both working-class and upper-class students . it comes to the 'startling' conclusion that rich kids might do the same bad things working-class kids do , but get away with it because their money gives them privileges . the film plays as if it's a slogan for "" stupid pride . "" at the school , he meets all the stock characters you would expect in such a formulaic film . better bongs . in the silliness that goes for either comedy or dramatics , which wasn't funny or enlightening , just stupid and incredible , dunph goes to the brown university dean and pleads for jane to be taken back , supposedly proving that he learned something about personal responsibility at the prep school . the problem with all these resolutions were that all the characters were clich ? s , no one's character was fleshed out , and this film based loosely on peter farrelly's life , never got untracked . the story might have been a heartfelt one for the author , who is the co-director with his brother bobby of "" there's something about mary , "" but it had little impact on film and was very much underwritten . there was just no story to get into which was worth getting into , nor were any of the characters in the least bit interesting . it all seemed like a futile effort to catch something about class status that had already been caught in a better light by recent films like "" rushmore "" and "" slums of beverly hills . "" "
279,"this very bitter film , a retread of "" the blue angel , "" might appeal to fans of the great french actress jeanne moreau , in one of her best performances ever , who plays eva with a true intensity . she is the soul of the film , making this dark and improbable story have some teeth to bite into . it is filmed in a coldly sweeping baroque style . the jazzy musical score is by michel legrand , and the great billie holiday song "" weep for me , "" is most appropriate for the down mood the film idles on from beginning to end . the principal characters were simply not only not likable , lovable , or even cordial , they are personifications of a destructive god , willing to take not only themselves down , but anyone else who gets in their way . the story itself is the film's problem , because it is so unsettling and foolishly perverse , that it never promises any sunlight , so what is seen in the film's first fifteen minutes is exactly what you get by the finale , in a film that drags on for too long , coming to no point but trying its best to bring you down with its sour look at life . the only kind thing that can be said about the femme fatale , is that she's upfront with him . this scathing romance , which abstains from love , instead it favors romance as being something that darkly possesses you , as the flawed protagonist leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth . it's film that basically is asking two unanswerable questions : how do you explain a woman's love for a guy who is no good ? losey lets the pessimistic mood of the story prevail as his answer . . . "
280,"if one were to applaud the effort . will pretentious crap do for a succinct review of the film ! it is more of a joke than a serious film , as all it tries to do is push the boundaries of technical innovation , while it neglects the basics of movie making : character development and the telling of a good story . shot on digital video in real time , with four hand-held cameras filming four different split screens , allowing the viewer to pick his poison as to which screen to watch , the narrative is told without any cuts , therefore no editor is needed . one of the screens has a louder volume , indicating that is the one the director thinks we might be more interested in watching . this soap opera story is about the lives and loves of sundry people connected to a hollywood production company , as they cast for their latest film project , which it turns out , is similar to the film just seen . well , at least , there should be something said about honesty in recognizing the worth of the product produced . the filmmaker's attempt here , is to make a stinging satire on hollywood and himself . timecode , under the pretense of being innovative , gets a big studio to take a chance on producing it , which doesn't mean it's worthwhile . the film was most like one of those stationary camcorder sites that they have on the internet , of say , some street corner , where the viewer hopes the time he spends is not wasted and something spontaneous will unfold to make it worth his while . at various times , the obvious symbolism of an earthquake is used as an artificial means to shake up all the characters in the quadrant . it was awkwardly done , seemingly ruining whatever natural effect was aimed for in telling this story in real time . i just couldn't get interested in this experimental film , finding it dizzying to watch and i was also hampered by its lack of wit and lack of spontaneous outrageousness . "" timecode "" just couldn't translate its sense of fun to the viewer , at least it couldn't to me . as for the technical feats attempted , maybe a more innovative filmmaker could make something of this format that wasn't done right here . other than that , this plays mostly as a novelty film , one to see because it's part of movie history . "
281,"there was a worm in the core of this turgid thriller that spoiled its taste . the moody production of smilla's sense of snow is adapted from peter hoeg's best-seller . this is a film with so much unrealized potential , about the icy heroine of the story , the tough-minded half-american and half-greenland inuit , smilla jaspersen ( julia ormond ) , who seemingly stepped into a hole in the ice before the film's finale and was ludicrously transformed from a captivating noir personality to a typical hollywood action heroine . smilla's sense of snow presents a mysterious story relying on tense local atmosphere , enigmatic characters and twists in the plot , to spin its dark tale of a heroine looking to find her roots again . the danish director , bille august , who tries to be faithful to his fellow countryman's source material , presents a glossy and sleek looking film that inherits all the virtues and vices of the book , and comes up short in the end because it cannot overcome how utterly ludicrous the story becomes . the film opens as a meteorite , in the greenland of 1859 , hits the ice and crushes everyone in the vicinity , including an inuit fisherman , putting on a spectacular light show in the crushed ice , reminding me of the pyrotechnics one would see at a july 4th celebration . what should strike the audience as even stranger is how the film ends up in the same ice caves where the film opened up its story in the 19th century . this is how one would do it in a formulaic hollywood film , thereby putting a damper on the terrific mood the film had just set . it was sort of like going to dinner and getting a whiff of some sensual aromas and looking at some appetizing food on display , but when getting down to the heart of the meal with great anticipation , suddenly discovering the meal is just not edible . if you can be satisfied with just the atmosphere and not the story or any character being developed adequately , then you might feel adequately nourished by what you saw . i wasn't . i was just swept away by the moody setting , the fine stoic performance by ormond , and the potential for intrigue -- which , unfortunately , never materialized as it could have . "
282,"the film's subject is the search for ideal love . it is the second feature of writer-director cameron crowe ( say anything . this fluff film fails to be absorbing because it is so sugary and forgettable , but with that being said , it still had a few tender moments that seemed worth while . there was nothing special about their up and down relationship , as it was very predictable . bridget fonda and matt dillon are a more interesting pairing . sheila kelley's stock character is sketchy and dull , of one who will do anything to get a man . the videographer is "" batman "" director tim burton . the grunge rock scene was fun to watch , the characters were more likable than not , there was a lot of tenderness shown for those who get hurt in relationships , and the film is emotionally as sweet as pie . the director is good at getting at light comedic moments , but has nothing much to say that is more serious . this is not an engaging film , and its whimsical story and clich ? characters did not hold my interest . the film was just too mild in attitude and tame in spirit . it is really a youth oriented film , with trite sayings which sound terribly out of place , such as when one of the characters says , "" being alone , there is a certain dignity to it . "" the film could be best enjoyed for its soundtrack , which includes the music of soundgarden , mudhoney , alice in chains and pearl jam in the background . "
283,"a very obvious melodrama about the relationship of a southern-white trash mother-daughter . the story is not the thing here , but the unflappable , zesty performance janet mcteer gives , as she becomes absorbed in her part and plays it with emotional force , carrying this picture for all its worth . my problem with the film , is that it didn't absorb me in its story . i just thought the mother-daughter were likable and the film was pleasant , but not far-reaching .

286,"what can you say about this set in baltimore film , by the king of bad taste , john waters , except it is what can be expected from the director whose type of rebellious childish low-budget indie films have now become passe since his peak days of the 1970s , when he made "" pink flamingos . "" now his satire has become more tame than outrageous . it is ironic that the director made a film railing about the poor quality of a hollywood film and has made a film that is equally as bad , if not worst . this is a shoddy production , the comedy is lame , the acting almost non-existent , and the satire is sophomoric , taking pop shots at an easy target such as hollywood , but shots that have no sting . if i laughed more , then i could have found some justification for the film . at best , this "" demented "" could be seen as a tv sketch on "" saturday night live , "" or a straight to video movie release . as a full-length feature , it ran out of gas shortly after the initial kidnapping scene and went quickly downhill due to a lack of subtlety and the film's inability to be challenging or get at what is really troubling about pop culture . it certainly can't be because the theaters still make popcorn in cocoanut oil and people who go to theaters in the mall talk during the film . demented rants that he is quite willing to die for art and will do anything to make his film . -- to her enthusiasm about changing her image and acting in their film , made for some of the most amusing scenes in the film . the kidnapping scene had some energy in it before even that became tiresome . there was some gentle digs at hollywood : from poking fun at a pauly shore film marathon to the mall showing only "" star wars "" and "" star trek "" films to the set of the expensive remake of "" forrest gump "" being taken over by the guerillas to `les enfants du paradis' panned for being insultingly dubbed in english to mocking the maryland film commission to the "" patch adams "" film showing of a director's cut in the mall . these were easy targets and the comedy wasn't that funny or radical . it might have been funny on paper but when acted out , it seemed to be mild stuff , things even mainstream films do in a more daring way these days . everyone in the film is bursting at the seams thinking about sex , but cecil has outlawed sex until the movie is completed , so they all live by being sexually frustrated and some are even confused about what kind of sexuality fits them . there's not much to prove by the kidnapping , as the story is really irrelevant . the thing here is if the character can shock you and if the film hit your funny bone . for me , it came up close to empty in all respects . i'll take my deranged films from andy warhol anytime , whose freaks are really freaky and whose stories have more of an edge to them . here , dorff is good enough as the abby hoffman characterization of a punk who has gone completely mental as a deranged artist , while griffith is a good sport , taking in all the remarks about honey's age , her ego-centredness , her tantrums , her phony public demeanor and her defense of the kind of film she made a reputation on as a hollywood star , first defending and then renouncing it . but i wouldn't call her performance acting , as she was mainly around to play a prop of herself to be used as a source for the comedy . the satire was not tough enough to make this a biting film , but rather one that has no claws to scratch and no gumption to really antagonize anyone but the christian right-wing moralists . and since it can still at least do that , no matter how trivial this film is , i guess , the film has a little fire in its belly . . . by the way , water's stated in an interview that the film got its title "" cecil b . demented , "" because that's what he was called in an early review . "
287,"the third dull hollywood film about mars in a little over a year , after tim burton's "" mars attacks ! "" i would think that three strikes and you're out should apply to any more of these space bombs cast into theaters by producers with big budgets and small stories . this one's a nuts-and- bolts sci-fier that looks good but its dialogue is just terrible , with the capable cast unable to overcome the poorly plotted story and saying things like val kilmer is forced to say about mars , "" things happen on mars that are extreme and otherworldly . "" the characters are either undeveloped or predictable stock characters . south african director anthony hoffman directs without imagination , as the film seems to drag on at a lethargic pace . the "" red planet "" was also void of humor and the obstacles encountered by the astronauts seemed arbitrarily thrown into the film to purposefully give the film an excuse for the special effects to be the star . i think hollywood should reevaluate its plans to make these special effect only films about mars and see if they can go back to the drawing board and put some life into these stories about the earth's last frontier . those b-movies made in the 1950s on a shoestring budget were more entertaining to me than this large-scale leaden sci-fi adventure story . the other crew members are so boring and one-dimensional , that when they started getting picked off one by one , for one reason or another , i was rooting for a more efficient way of getting rid of them , maybe picking up the pace at two at a time killings . this was some crew , lacking in credibility , wit and likability ! the mars lander descends to the surface with gallagher , burchenal , santen , pettengil and chantilas . we then get into the special effects part of the film , the only thing the film can brag about , as there's a well-photographed crash landing scene . did god do it ? it's an interesting theme , but this film was only able to grab onto its spectacular special effects ( showing the mars earth mysteriously moving ) and by proving that there is life on mars , and was not able to follow through on any ideas invested in the far-reaches of the story . i thought the film lacked suspense , and the acting was only bearable , not giving this film too much of a chance to overcome its overall dullness . if you are the kind of viewer who goes bananas for technology , this film might seem better to you than what i thought of it , as that part of the film was stunning , indeed . but if you are interested in a lively story , then i'm afraid you wouldn't get that on this mission . "
288,"the cinematographer ed emshwiller , once known as emsh , used a hand-held 135-pound sound camera for some scenes , often composing superimpositions in the camera . adolfas has come up with an offbeat , lighthearted romantic/comedy spoof , that gently mocks france's new wave cinema , which was the vogue among intellectuals at the time . this is a film geared to film buffs and indie lovers who are interested in some of the early 1960s works coming out of the underground cinema movement in the states . there is no political message or drug visualizations here , as the film tends to rely on the energy conveyed by the characters and the fun they seemed to be having with this unpredictable material they had to work with . if you're into sight-gags and strange visual images , then you should be pleased with the enthusiastic direction of this film . i enjoyed it as a look back at a more innocent time in cinema and a chance to watch it poke fun at other arty styles of cinema . the comedy part of the film had the feel of those buster keaton silent ones . as an homage to the 'new wave , ' vera is played by a different actress in the courting scenes with jack and leo , which take place during different seasons . i guess they both had different impressions of her , so it does make sense that they see her differently , therefore why not have a different actress play her for each . the bizarre visuals gave this film its slapstick look , as there was one scene of the boys dancing a hebrew dance by a campfire in the woods , in another chinese subtitles appear to the side of a landscape scene , in another the boys frolic in a frozen lake , in one scene there are people instead of birds on the branches of a tree . it was goofy fun . "
289,"a poignant melodrama about the side effects of battle-fatigue lingering after ww11 . it is a finely acted and well produced film , but the story itself is not that involving . i found its build-up to the climax , where secrets would be bared about how meeker got to be the way he was , not worth the wait in finding out . what the film did well was show that after the war many americans thirsted for a better standard of life and thought they could get it in the suburbs . meeker was particularly effective in being a sympathetic figure , craving for affection and love , in this low-key human interest story . "
290,"a film advertised as an exploitive film about steamy sex that fails to deliver that part of the bargain , but delivers an expose on white slavery practices in new york city at the turn of the century . the shots of ellis island are interesting from an historical prospective rather than in the primitive way they were shot by the movie . it is worth seeing the film for an authentic look at how the city looked , but should be especially interesting for cinefiles to see how film has developed a long way from then and to film buffs who are interested in seeing a film that is rarely shown . this is the same theme westerns used for decades in their b-films . though the film was contrived and certainly couldn't hold-up to modern scrutiny of what we might think a good film should be like , it was nevertheless a milestone in film , paving the way for the kind of films hollywood would soon become noted for making . in my opinion , they should have chosen to make artistic films like von stroheim's silent classic 'greed' ( 25 ) , instead of taking this more exploitive and superficial path . but that doesn't prevent this film from being an interesting watch . "
291,"also , the locations are gorgeous ( actual location shots are in ecuador's quito wilderness ) and the escapist story about kidnap-and-ransom has enough of a tinge of realism to catch one's interest . . . but all that is still not enough to stop the thinly plotted story from dragging in spots , bringing on a dullness to its critical life-and-death situations , and falling into clich ? territory from the get-go , as the film failed to be anything but trite -- a film that tried desperately to have a heart , but all it has to show for its effort is that it looks like a typical hollywood action film , something tried and marketed many times before . a good film to rest your brain cells and get carried away by the star's screen presence . and , if you do not judge the film on a more critical standard , i think you'll get your money's worth , that is , if you're in the market for seeing a beautiful looking escapist film . that flat rambo-like chopper rescue is a rehearsal for the expected rescue that will set the scene for the film's payoff , showing us beforehand what terry is capable of doing . it made for dull film fare , even though it smacked of some semblance of truth . this film just got butchered because it was unable to be imaginative and make its exciting plot line come alive . it just stalls and falls into a rather trite escapade into the jungles to rescue an american engineer from revolutionaries who are caricatured as being stupid , cruel , lazy , and high on drugs . their romance was forgettable , leaving me feeling too distant from the lovers and their flirtatious romance . it certainly didn't have the impact of the romantic parting in "" casablanca , "" an ending this film tried to emulate . the film just didn't have too much juice in its hackneyed story , or in its generalized characterization of revolutionaries , oil moguls , and heroes . "
292,"adjectives such as vacuous and pretentious fit this film to a tee . it was unable to get theater bookings , even with the star-studded cast and paul schrader's prestigious name listed as the screenwriter and director , and even though it played at the toronto and telluride film festivals . the script was pale , leading nowhere but down a dark path of murky noir morality . by the time we get to the payoff scene , the film seemed meaningless . the movie is a mess . . . with sappy dialogue fit more for a film like erich segal's "" love story . "" this one layed an egg with the whiny and pleading joseph fiennes character reduced to saying mostly corny love lines to the boring gretchen mol character for most of the film . it is a film that believes love can be pure , that it can overcome all sorts of corruption in the world . it is a film that believes certain people are made for each other and will overcome any obstacle to be together . that idea might have sounded good on paper , but when shot on film , the steamy love story turns out to be dull , mainly because fiennes and mol didn't seem to connect , there was hardly any electricity between the two when in each other's arms . ray liotta's corrupt world of politics and business , seemed too generalized a characterization to give spice to the story . schrader seemed to be trying to make some obscure political point by comparing the watergate year of 1973 when the film begins -- with the even more corrupt reagan contra involvement in 1987 -- when the film ends . so much for the pure love the story tried to convey ! "
293,"a meant to be chic sci-fi film , set in an ohio high school , that pays homage to a number of other trashy genre horror films , but especially to horror classics such as "" invasion of the body snatchers "" and "" the thing "" and more surprisingly to "" the breakfast club , "" as in the film's best moments , it explores teen relationships and the pressure put on teens to succeeed by parents and from peer pressure to conform with the group . the fast-paced story , the crisp editing , and the atmospheric music plus all the schlock horror it could throw out to the audience by using those traditional podlike aliens , helped make this a silly venture geared mainly for the under 25 crowd ( i'm not only referring to age , but to i . q . ) . robert rodriguez ( "" el mariachi "" / "" desperado "" ) , the director , and kevin williamson ( "" scream "" ) , the screenwriter , have created a film that lacks suspense , lacks freshness , lacks wit , and suffers from some rather lame special effects . if there is enjoyment to be found , it's in the frantic moments when the students are acting out their stereotypes and some of the vilest things come up out of their wiser-than-they-should-be mouths . it's a cult film for those with a taste for earwigs , a stomach for slop , and an appetite for mind altering drugs . . . gee ! i wonder why i wasn't more taken with the film ! "
294,"a mystery thriller from the pen of daphne du maurier , tepidly adapted to the screen from gore vidal's murky script in a workman-like way by robert hamer . it's a one-idea film and that idea is unable to dispel all the holes in the blurry plot , even though it is well-acted . it is a dual role he plays admirably , but he does not leave any lasting impression in either part . the surprise ending was predictable and did not help salvage this rather dry film . the film's main fault was that it failed to maintain a level of tension for its mystery story , and the three weeks that barratt played at being a french nobleman was hardly believable . this is a good story as written for a book , but it was not filmed with any verve . the middle part of it seemed to be going nowhere and by the time the payoff came , the confrontation between the morally concerned barratt and the villainous count , seemed too artificial and lifeless for me to give its supposedly shocking outcome a second thought . "
295,"after all , it's still "" home , sweet home . "" the old-fashioned values displayed give the film a dated look , and all the manipulative situations prevent this film from being viewed as anything but a star vehicle , which should be pleasing for pickford fans . she's a real charmer , with a good cinema presence . the film had a few heartwarming moments : mom dancing an irish jig , terry taking his date pickford home and then -- climbing up the rickety steps of the tenement and looking chagrined as he was thwarted from kissing her as she toyed with him , and there was also the playful mood displayed by pickford with all the men in her life , not a bit envious of her so-called betters , proud of the inner character she has . . . even the film should be of special interest to mary pickford fans and to those who want to see why she was considered "" america's sweetheart . "" "
296,"his auteur signature is to create shocking scenes and characters who will try to freak the audience out . this in-your-face film is about attitude . i can't say that i enjoyed it , or found it interesting , but i can say that i found it different . . . and , it didn't box me in as to how i was to view the characters , letting me make up my own mind as to how i wanted to feel about them . yet korine didn't seem to trust all this poetry he was spreading about and needs to end the film in a conventional way , with a dramatic scene regarding the pregnancy of chloe sevigny . korine shot it on digital video and transferred it to film according to the rules of dogma 95 . the film is an anti-narrative and linear work . he is prone to babbling , drooling , and acting outrageous in a harmless way . a host of characters infiltrate the film for some quick laughs , but , as odd as they were , they seemed like the type of people the family members would be acquainted with , so the scenes with them didn't appear to be as much a freak show as it was a way to make the film entertaining . but the problem was , they didn't go with the flow of the film , as their eccentric behavior seemed forced . in the film's most dramatic moment , towards the end of the movie , pearl trips while at an ice rink and has a miscarriage . i appreciate the effort for originality attempted here , especially with the abundance of formula mainstream and indie films pushed at the public , but i would like to see something more intellectually demanding than just a rant against conventional filmmaking . the filmmaking skills are there , but as of yet , i don't see the 25-year-old director moving too far from the childish shock scenes he threw at the audience for his first film . i'm sure the director meant well by this characterization and that is not where i have difficulty with this film , my difficulty is that the novelty of hearing the incomprehensible chatter of julien soon wore off and the film seemed to grow vacuous and became more a technical film addressing how korine can fool those dogma 95 people by putting in shots with artificial light , which he did numerous times , by breaking the rules he promised to fulfill when getting his dogma 95 certificate , then it was a film about ideas . i would much rather he had made a more substantial film rather than making another anti-intellectual indie film , mainly showing off his superior knowledge of digital video techniques . . . but offering no real insights into the mentally unbalanced characters deeper than what is seen on the surface . there is still too much skateboarder braggadocio in him and not enough filmmaker . . . but the future holds a lot of promise for this talented filmmaker . "
297,"a beautiful piece of junk , amounting to a spectacle for the eyes only , as the film itself couldn't justify the violence and human depravity shown . this surreal thriller amounts to a beautifully photographed and stylish film . there is no rational payoff to explain what is happening except this is some pretty sick stuff we are seeing . it's a vile film , that tries to take the film down the same road as coppola's "" the conversation "" and where a number of other morally blurred films about voyeurism had gone , aiming mostly , perhaps , along the lines of brian de palma's suspenseful works . it works into its story devices from a multitude of other films , except this one just didn't add up and seemed to dwell on the grisly violence the woman psychopathic killer commits and offered no valid critical reason to justify all the gore in this beautiful looking but pointless film . lang flatly plays a sympathetic agent in eye's workplace who always appears on a laptop screen . since nothing in this film made sense , why should one expect her role to ! so the film ends as clumsily and distantly as it was throughout . as all we get from this film are some cheap exploitive thrills and a tease that there is some intellectual message hidden in all the mental gymnastics , but what we really have , is a film that failed to get untracked . "
298,"a made for tv movie that looks and feels like a made for tv movie ( it was stale ) . since i wasn't held in suspense , i instead turned my attention on guessing who did it , using my conditioned experiences from watching such tv shows , therefore i knew it wouldn't be the most obvious one . i did guess who it was about half way through on a hunch , since the plot didn't leave much in clues . i hate to be a killjoy , but that , unfortunately , was the only enjoyment i got out of the film . set in a city hospital , the film pays homage to soap operas like general hospital , as in numerous scenes a patient is seen watching the unnamed soap opera , as is the bartender where the doctors hangout , rosie ( ann wedgeworth ) . it made for a forgettable film , one that was probably intended as a pilot for a possible tv series . the b-film left a warm spot in my heart , as it cured my insomnia without me using a sleeping pill and having to worry about side effects . "
299,"an off-beat , haunting , overwrought fairy tale for adults . this visually pleasing allegory ends on an apocalyptic note . it takes a stab at being an intelligent slasher movie for those who like their gore laced with some sensible dialogue to go along with its good and evil characterizations . the surreal forest sets the dark mood for philip ridley's eerie and atmospheric film . what propels this film is not the slight story , but the bold interactions among the characters and the striking symbolic conflict over strict biblical interpretations versus a worldly sensual view of life . but the film just couldn't wait to get to the slasher part fast enough , and that left very little time in the film's middle to go into the brainy part of the movie , leaving the film literally and figuratively going up in smoke by the finale . "
300,"a modern day western adapted from cormac mccarthy's national book award-winning novel of 1992 , which was accurately transferred to film by ted tally's script , as it kept the same laconic cowboy dialogue from the book intact , but was reduced considerably from the over three hour length director billy bob thornton originally shot it in , to under two hours , the length the people from miramax wanted it . it was hard to tell if the film was missing anything because of this deletion , but i did find the film to be directed with a skewed sense of rhythm . there were also too many scenes that failed to go anywhere , making the film dull at times . for a slow moving film , there was the contradiction of scenes happening too fast to be developed and fully realized . as a result , "" all the pretty horses "" failed to be engaging . if the filmmaker was aiming for an epic , he sure didn't get it in this sometimes elegaic film . what he got is something that plays more like a slick magazine photo shoot on the travails of being a cowboy , or as a touristy travelogue of what the old west was like , or as a stylish film that can't find what it wants to say and stumbles around in the grimness of a prosaic story about youthful aspirations . what it lacked was some emotional kick , as the scenes where the cowboys show off their spirited exuberance , seemed more portentous than not and just didn't jive with the unsure pace of the film . what caught my attention in a positive way was how pretty the picturesque vistas were and how the film gave off some good cowboy vibes about friendship and loyalty and had some good cowboy lingo to go along with all the pretty horses and with the hot-blooded senorita played by pen ? lope cruz . it becomes an on-the-trail film , with a love story and a revenge story filling in the life of the youthful cowboy drifters , as everything in the film gets boiled down to a simplicity that is too simple-minded to just accept without asking questions . "" how i was is how i am , and all i know is to stick . "" now that's some wicked cowboy talk 'pardner ! ' i found him to be the most interesting one in the film , as he adds his childish stubborness , volatility , homespun humor , tough backbone for fair play , silly superstitions about thunder and brings with him the hard-luck of someone who never had a chance in this world , giving this complacent film , seemingly so self-satisfied with its boring self , a chance to become energized by his maverick portrayal . when blevens is onscreen , the shallowness of the story doesn't seem to matter , because his coming-of-age story is better than john grady's . i'm not believing what i can't see . there might have been a good picture in this tale , but it just never kicked in . everything about the film felt choppy and not certain of the direction it was going in . the star-crossed lovers had no depth or sense of urgency in their lustful romance , and the film spent so much time trying to tie up all the loose-ends about the romance , and yet it had nothing much to say about it , as it always seemed hollow . though the buddy story was well-played between damon and thomas , as damon showed that he could be expressive and wear his changing feelings in a credible way . his problem was , even though he could physically do the cowboy role , i was never convinced that he actually was one . but the most disheartening thing about this film , was how out of whack it seemed , as the story had no staying power , it kept going off the trail , until it looked more like a marlboro billboard commercial than an enriching story of two decent young men living out their dream to be cowboys . something must have gotten lost in adapting the book to film , because i couldn't find where the heartfelt story was in all the superficiality i was surrounded by . the real star of this film was the landscape , i couldn't take my eyes off it . i think pen ? lope cruz can act ( at least she can in an almodovar film ) , but in this film she's around only as part of the beautiful scenery . i know matt damon can act and he shows in this film that he can let us look inside him , but i don't think he was up to being the romantic lead needed to make this film come alive . overall the film lacked a psychological breath to get us more involved in the characters . after seeing that , i didn't know whether to laugh or cry . "
301,"a casual , inane throwaway film , directed by peter howitt , of "" sliding door "" infamy , without aplomb and best viewed as being a film about a geek getting a dream job that turns out to be nightmare . a film geared for those who can't get enough of geek angst , pc's , and cappuccino into their system , and therefore need unrealistic thrillers about geek lifestyles to inspire them with more highs from cyberspace . while , for others , they can relish in the film's anti-microsoft feelings . gary takes that gates persona on and runs with it into murderous territory , where even gates' harshest critics haven't gone in their description of him . you're a one or a zero . a tour of nurv's ultra-modern geek headquarters , which is a campus with multi-buildings and satellites on it , fills us in on the atmosphere around such high-tech complexes . the film enters the world of make-believe and has the same empty feeling to it as a bond film . speak about perfect casting , then you must speak about tim robbins . he's really fun to watch in his understated but brilliant performance as the sociopath billionaire , a clone of bill gates . he even looks like gates . ryan phillippe is energetic and believable as the curly-haired nerd , who can't say no to capitalism , even if he can't say yes to it . the film is modestly entertaining . it is certainly diverting . it is also senseless and unimportant . it's a hollywood film , a nostalgia film about the heyday of internet startups in the 1990s and of the powerful global influence of the microsoft empire it emulates and the many geeks it drew into its sticky web and through stock-options made some millionaires and some billionaires . a film for those who are into 'virtual unreality . ' there is no message in this improbable tale that isn't garbled . the filmmaker had a chance to say something , but prefers to play it safe and come up with a possible blockbuster out of a film rife with mindless action sequences . i could see an audience for this film consisting of cyberspace junkies willing to see anything about computers . it is an absurd film that was one mouse click away from crashing . "
302,"offbeat film director alan rudolph ( chooseme ) makes films that require an acquired taste to fully enjoy . in this fluff piece , which the director calls a "" screwball noir , "" it suffers mostly because its mixture of being a formula noir tale and a comic farce is overtaken by its forced comedy and a story that has little drama in it , but it perks up at times because of the charming performances by all concerned and the constant barrage of wacky dialogue . the film starts off in an amusingly pleasant way , as trixie's banter is laced with continuous malapropisms such as , 'by hook or ladder , ' 'he smokes like a fish , ' and 'nobody is human . ' the film's strongest scene is set on red's boat , where violence and a possible sense of an orgy happening clouds the pleasure cruise . unfortunately , the picture itself also unravels . this is an actor's picture , where they are given every chance to do their thing , even if it results in over-acting . the film was mildly enjoyable , but could have been much better if rudolph tried to put a coherent story together instead of just going for cheap comedy . "
303,"the wedding planner is a romantic comedy cut from the cloth of the hollywood studio zany comedies of the '50s . it reminded me most of "" the father of the bride , "" only it didn't have spencer tracy's assurances that everything would turn out ok , as the film looked real good for the first 70 minutes and then slid into tedium and then into a contrived ending ala "" the graduate . "" massimo is a manipulative clod , with a penchant for saying and doing the wrong thing , and is someone she never liked , even though he's not bad looking . upon the introduction of massimo into the story , the film loses its energy . but there should be no surprise how everything is resolved . it's a modestly successful romantic comedy , much like those old-fashioned fluff films of yesterday . it's ready made for an audience that applauds when two people who are meant for each other , wind up with each other no matter what . hollywood loves churning out stories like that because they're good box office and have mass appeal . this is one of those films , and if that's your poison , be my guest , you won't be disappointed by this one . the film's big joke is when jennifer is told she has a big neck , an obvious reference to jay leno's running gag about her big derri ? re . "
304,"a sometimes engaging indie film about three best friends growing up in nyc , that is a heartfelt story but is hampered by its awkward dialogue and unfulfilling plot . all these characters seemed contrived and left the film feeling flat , though comedy burst forth from time to time . the best conversations are between danny and stan , and give the pic its intellectual stimulus and reason for being . "" went to coney island "" never got untracked , though it had some bright dramatic moments and some perceptive comic offerings , but it could never come together as a complete picture . it was also done in by a needless subplot of stan getting into gambling debts and being beaten , which just seemed like padding to a thin story . too much of the film seemed to have no place to go , just like misinformed tourists who go to coney in the winter to see the idle cyclone ride . "
305,"a poor imitation of lubitsch's classic romance/comedy trouble in paradise . even though it is terribly outdated for modern audiences , it was seen as the height of fashion at its time as for style and dress . it was a witty depression eye-pleaser for american audiences who liked to watch the rich in action , especially seeing them get robbed of their jewels . "
306,"there's something whimsical to be said about universal-international's most strained sci-fi film of the 1950s , it sunk to new lows to get to its subject matter . in this heavy-handed message film , the main theme depicts how intolerant people could be who hide behind their religious beliefs blindly and continue to keep others ignorant of the truth . the adventure was clumsily made and was too pedantic to be good cinema . the acting was stiff and the special effects were cheesy . but somehow there was fun to be had in all this under the earth nonsense . "
307,"something that is more real than the computer games he is hooked on . the film can't seem to be told without the voiceover from leonardo dicaprio , explaining his thought process and what's going on . he seemed like a much nicer bloke than richard . . . but such is life ! the beach is the real star of the film , as the cinematography of it is scintillating . the film itself wasn't a bad film , as much as it was an empty one . there is just very little to digest here . the slight story is a predictable one , as the drug-dealing farmers mean business , so when richard's four unwanted acquaintances arrive , we know what response to expect from the farmers . it made for some beautiful fantasy shots via computer graphics , but added nothing to the film's story . the film concludes as a lesson that there is no such thing as a paradise on earth , and if there were , it wouldn't remain one for long because man's desires are far-reaching . so it's back to virtual reality for the dicaprio character , after all , the theme of the film seems to imply , maybe that's not so bad a thing to be doing with your life . in an interview he gave for cable tv , he said he didn't mind that this hollywood film took some liberties with his story to juice it up sexually so we can see leonardo romance the beautiful virginie ledoyen and have another affair with tilda swinton , additions that were not part of the novel . the photography of that underwater kiss with ledoyen was sensational , as they were lit up like christmas trees from the opalescent plant life that surrounded them . the romance itself had no sparkles in it . overrated director , danny boyle ( "" a life less ordinary "" / "" trainspotting "" / "" shallow grave "" ) , is skilled at working his magic on films that are basically insubstantial by relying on non-narrative things to do the job , such as the energy from the actors and the beauty in his visual sets . here , he is aided by the wonderfully gifted cinematographer , darius khondji , who makes the beach look like a cross between the figment of one's psychedelic dream and an ongoing computer game , something you can't take your eyes off . it was just too bad that the story didn't have more weight to it , or should i say some weight to it , because this film played mostly like a travelogue . don't blame the actors for what went wrong here , they did their job the best they could . the fault is all in the script .

308,"a sci-fi film , originally started as a student project , noted only for its great special effects , as created by dennis muren . muren now does the special effects for george lucas on his star war films and won an oscar for his work . this film is a good example of his first effort doing special effects in a feature film . the problem with this film -- that came 30 years before blair witch project and has its same scary themes played out in the woods by students -- is its amateur acting , shoddy production values , horrible script , and ridiculous story . the acting is so flat and awkward , that the film never seemed professional , even though it was reworked for theatrical release . it could be appreciated by some horror film buffs despite all its shortcomings and genre clich ? s for its crudeness . there are just some people who love bad films . the film is one long flashback of dave's recollections , as he seems to be also recollecting things he wasn't even involved with . don't ask me how he can do that ! jim , in between bites on his picnic chicken , says this is pretty heavy stuff . hey , jim ! the remainder of the film is a testimony to the special effects created on such a limited budget , but the story can only be constued as ridiculous , as the four young students who must have taken stupid pills to still be hanging around in the woods , continue on with their adventure . asmodeus will show his true face to jim and make him an offer for the book , offering to conjure up anything in the world he wants for it , which sounds like a fair trade , if you ask me . "
309,"a mindless action film that exploits the current news headlines while it presents andy warhol's dictum that , in the future , everybody will be famous for 15 minutes , and adds to that its ludicrous plot revolving around how everyone is enchanted by fame , either wanting to be a celebrity or to gawk at them . it also presents an annoyingly didactic message about violence encouraged by the media for ratings and of criminals getting away with murder because they know how to bend the rules , as its maddening story only worsens with an incoherent finale . there is nothing subtle about this heavy-handed thriller . the good part of the film is its fast-paced street action scenes and the attention grabbing psychopathic villain ( karel roden ) challenging the self-absorbed celebrity ace homicide detective ( de niro ) , which makes for vulgar entertainment . it's a film that has about 15 minutes of fervor to it before it gets grounded into a mixture of sleaze , violence , and heartless melodrama . emil will at one point declare : "" i love america ! the only good thing about this arrangement , is that despite its seamly nature , eddie is a dedicated and good cop , and the show does help in catching criminals . other than the action scenes brilliantly filmed by jean yves escoffier , the movie is unappealing . as for the actors : de niro is playing a part he always does very well , showing off his comical gift for quirkiness and endowing his character with a larger than life presentation . burns is his opposite , a bland personality , who doesn't watch tv or seek publicity , and the performance succeeds only in being a bland one , intentional or not . the juiciest part is reserved for roden , who makes the most out of being a scary figure , a sociopath with an unintentionally droll wit . he could be any one of a number of tabloid tv slimy hosts , reminding me most of the ass kissing geraldo rivera . there's not much to this flick , except for the beautiful way its mayhem was filmed . its cynical opinion of the media seemed hypocritical , since this film is just as exploitive and violent as the tabloid tv show it was railing against for the whole two hours of this film . "
310,"it features style over substance and is less worried about storytelling than in looking odd and being confusingly mod . the film leaves too many loose ends as to what the heck is going on for it be clearly understood . it can best be enjoyed for its visual beauty , especially , in its smoky gothic images of the manhattan skyline and the luxury residence of the antiheroes . to understand what's really happening requires reading whitley streiber's novel , from which the film is based . since this info is only clear by reading the book , this film makes a gross error in its filmmaking decisions by not letting these details out of the bag in its storytelling . this was the best scene in the film , as dick smith's makeup for the aging bowie was terrific . the hunger left me craving for a more filling movie . in the hands of a better director , this cult film could have been a real tasty treat . "
311,"a visually pleasing but unmoving homage biopic of the 18th-century spanish painter francisco goya . the director , carlos saura , has had trouble with the storytelling part of his films in the past , as his great craftsmanship skills seem to far exceed his other abilities as a filmmaker . the film opens in a surreal manner as a cow's carcass seems to be dragging itself over a dirt red field to a scaffold and then raises itself up as its flesh opens and its insides are exposed . it was goya's belief that man without imagination is only an animal , and this is the first lesson we are taught in this pedantic film study of him . the film never touched base with the painter and his great works of art . it seemed like a dry lecture , with the artist's paintings laboriously put on display , making for some gorgeous framed shots , but not offering a film that is emotionally touching . what we learn is that goya was a flawed man , feeling himself to be cowardly and weak-spirited at times , whose great influences to overcome his shortcomings were , vel ? zquez , rembrandt , and his imagination tied to reason . but the film itself does not let on why we should assume goya was a great painter , it seems to have failed the artist in that sense . i was left with the impression that if this film would continue in its pedantic way of telling the story , it is possible in part 2 that we would know why that was so . "
312,"my darling ! ) for a hammer film , this one is as good it gets for them . it's a bizarre psychological story with lots of hitchcock's psycho in it . it's a disturbing film about a hostage situation involving an insane religious fanatic . tallulah bankhead plays the bible quoting nut mrs . trefoile , in an over-the top performance that is frightening to behold . as crazy as the tale was , it all seemed possible . "
313,"a shlock frankenstein flick by strock . this ones strictly for the drive-in crowd of the 1950s . to see it in the next century , is to watch how a bad film could still be around because it has attained cult-film status . everything is there but the face . there's a discreet housekeeper who is hardly seen , except when she serves him meals . this upsets doc so much that he cuffs her . getting no response , doc says "" answer me ! you have a civil tongue in your head ! i know , i sewed it in there ! "" the monster turns out to be a bit cranky and is not completely obedient to his master . the film's violent climax for some reason switches out of it b&w format and goes into technicolor . this is a lovable bad film , but don't ask me why ! "
314,"this is an obscure bela lugosi film and it's not bad . bela's the bad guy with a foreign accent . his fans will love him here , as this film has been restored recently and is now watchable . "
315,"it's good in parts , but it fails to deliver in its unbelievable surprise ending . "
316,"an enigmatic thriller that never quite gets going . it's always too enigmatic and bleak , and its surprise ending falls like a dead weight into a waterfalls . it's a film that successfully and darkly explores the motives of its three female characters and their ambiguous relationships with others . "
317,"this is a swiss cheese psycho genre film . there are just too many holes in the plotline of this hollow thriller for it to be convincing . the film is most successful in hiding its plot twists and its surprise ending but , in going for that and that alone , the film lost track of how unbelievable the story was becoming and how shallow all the characters were , except for the morgan freeman character . morgan freeman played the same role in the 1997's kiss the girls , and that mediocre film brought in lots of dough ( $60 million ) . so the producers must have thought , why not try and cash in on another mediocre thriller ! unfortunately , freeman can't carry this film on his back , though he almost does . he's so good an actor that he's usually better than the script he's given , as is the case here . the fun in this film might be in making a list of all the holes in the story , and whoever comes up with the first hundred wins a prize . once you get the error list rolling , you'll see how ludicrous this film is . i quickly counted thirty such flubs before i got weary and decided to give up my count . "
318,"the gauche wardrobe and fancy haircuts are part of the flashy drug scene and the film's attempt to capture the real look of the druggie scene . his hedonistic journey through the marijuana years of the 1960s and 1970s and the disco cocaine years of the 1980s and 1990s , is a sad reminder of the way the pop culture scene had its darker side . the highs from "" blow "" come mostly from the colorful fashion show it parades before us and depp's brilliantly nuanced performance , as he shows off his inscrutability and his swagger , where he challenges us to be sympathetic to him even if he's a lowlife drug dealer and an uninteresting character , whose selfish dream is all about himself accumulating money and material happiness . there was not much else to get off on , as "" blow "" didn't have the script or the kind of direction needed to blow one away . the movie plays it real safe , as the only users the audience sees are the flashy hollywood types that no one cares about . "" blow "" suffered because it was too simplistic in its storytelling , in its nonjudgmental stance on drugs , and in shamelessly pulling the audience to the side of the nice guy drug dealer , george jung . it doesn't even have the will of another recent drug trafficking film , "" traffic , "" to even spend a moment worrying about the consequences of hard drugs . but the biggest bust about "" blow , "" is that it's just not a good film to get off on . if cocaine was not the subject matter , this film would be boring ( and it probably wouldn't have been made ) . george failed to be a worthwhile character for us to care about him . this film is just another blip in a long line of unimportant drug related films . really . . . the best thing that could be said about the film , is that it doesn't preach to us . "
319,"a fast-paced film noir about corruption and double-crosses , that has a lot of plot twists and a nifty surprise ending . the film was cheaply made and the acting didn't distinguish itself . but the story had a lot of snap to it . it's not a bad watch , but lovers of film noir should like it more than others . "
320,a fair remake of the 1930 and 1920 versions of this film . a very conventional film . 
321,"a routine mystery story with a misleading title . this low budget film is watchable , but do not expect anything more than that . "
322,"legendary schlockmeister ed wood cited for winning the golden turkey award for worst director of all time and for bad films such as glen or glenda , bride of the monster , and plan 9 from outer space , and for being an inspiration to all bad directors , tries desperately to make a film noir out of jail bait . the film is so poorly acted , the script is so ludicrous , the settings are so tacky but , unfortunately , for woods , the plot and the narration tell a complete and understandable story ( something not done in wood films ) . this is wood's attempt to be taken seriously , and he makes this the best film he has ever made . unfortunately , this film is not as prone to unintended laughs as his others and therefore fails to live up to what the director has built his reputation on . "" jail bait "" is a misleading title for the film , as it is a phrase that usually refers to underaged women . he completes the surgery and utters out loud "" that plastic surgery at times seems to me to be very very complicated . "" "
323,"an old-fashioned love story that is more vague than uplifting . it plays more like an art-house film than as a realistic drama . the woman character immerses herself in raw nature as a means of reinvigorating her energy and escaping from her dull life . she's impressed by mart ? n's quiet demeanor and frankness , and his rugged good looks . the camera does a beautiful job of catching the raw countryside of hidden valley in long sweeping shots of its splendid mountain ranges and its raw terrain , and its magnificent forest . what happens next is too murky and not convincingly established to be totally believable , as things moved too fast without the viewer seeing what was happening ; not enough is ever revealed for us to comprehend what is behind her sudden conflict , except for her husband's lies and her fatal attraction for his brother . the film had a sad mood throughout and this was reinforced by mart ? n bauer's musical score for classic argentinean guitar and cello , which played in the background throughout the film . there even seems to be a hint that mart ? n is too gentle a person and could not have possibly committed murder , except nothing is ever settled for sure . even the moving performance by paola krum cannot uncover what the film is lacking . it remains too obscure , locked up too tightly in paola krum's mind . "
324,"a complex contemporary horror flick based on a novel by whitley strieber , that is slow in developing and when it becomes evident what's happening there's more interest intellectually in what is uncovered than thrills . there's much self-indulgent ecology to chew on , in this slickly filmed surrealistic presentation . but i found the film to be on the dull side ( except for the camera work ) . outstanding british cinematographer gerry fisher does the honors of making this a very stylish looking film , which gives the impression that something deeper than what appears to be happening is taking place . all the camera shots are presented in this manner , showing how the wolves can pick up man's scent much quicker than he can theirs and their heat-seeking vision can detect their quarry's body temperature . they cannot be vanquished ; so i guess the message is , that we better learn how to live with the werewolf , they will always be with us . hey , i'm willing to give it shot . . . as i think finney is , also . "
325,"an action-packed high-tech thriller , whose best virtues are that it doesn't take itself seriously and there's plenty of action . if you forget a little thing like the story doesn't make sense and the theater you are in supplies you with bon-bons , then there's a chance you might be lulled into accepting this flashy summertime film at face value and be pleased by it . the film has a snappy "" pulp fiction "" like start to it , as a puffy john travolta stares into the camera and his first words are : "" you know what the problem with hollywood is - they make shit . "" the film loses its wit and becomes a mindless thriller from here on , as director dominic sena ( gone in sixty seconds ) , a parolee himself from schlockmeister producer jerry bruckheimer , tries to push the envelope in favor of evil doings and away from making a pg-13 film . he succeeds in making an amoral film , where none of the characters are all good or bad ( or for that matter interesting ) . he leaves us with such an awful feeling , pretty much like this filmmaker left us with in "" gone in sixty seconds . "" this turns out to be another preposterous flick of his , but with the trappings that it has something more to say about the evil in the world than all the violence it pours onto the screen . the film has lots of expensive gadgets to work with , and they are used as explosives and as gimmicks to fill in for the words that stop making sense after a while . there are the usual betrayals and twists in such a story , the maddening conclusion to the hostage situation , and a dubious ending that is slickly done . with such a dark delineation of morals exhibited by all sides , who cares who wins ! this film is about exploding all the toys the big-budget allowed for and keeping the action frenetic and the sex as tawdry as possible . the acting was dreary . hugh jackman's performance was particularly rancid . john travolta thinks he's houdini , but he seems more like a guy getting good money for playing a part that required little acting skills other than to just look sinister and smile occasionally . this "" swordfish "" has a smell to it , like it's not fresh . but if you're looking for crass summertime entertainment , this dish of "" swordfish "" can please those who have a very tolerant palate . "
326,"a bittersweet romantic comedy , french style . the one thing this film has going for it , is nathalie baye in the starring role . this became a very popular french film winning france's c ? sar awards for best picture , best director , best young actress and best screenplay . as is the custom in a french film of this kind , love is the most important thing in the world . at first , we don't know what to make of antoine , whether he's a psycho or just a drifter , as his straggly appearance is not appealing to ang ? le . he tells her : "" i can't stop thinking of you -- i love you so much . "" it's a sexy french romp into familiar territory , with characters who don't tell us much about what's inside them . is able to remain pleasantly atmospheric until the nonsensical melodramatic climax , when its charmed life runs out of charm . there's nothing new uncovered about relationships here , in fact the main relationship is more absurd than real . but nathalie baye is able to carry off this fantasy romance story further than it deserved to go , and for that alone it's worth a look . "
327,"a slickly done , very depressive melodrama about those addicted to drugs and their dreams of happiness . it's a film that has excellent performances , especially , the brilliant one by ellen burstyn , as the pill popping old lady who morbidly changes her appearance for the worst after taking diet pills . aronofsky stylishly uses his camera to make us feel the internal grief of those who are looking for an easy way out of their empty lives . it's not an easy film to find comfort in , or feel anything but revulsion at the sight of the constant degradation of human beings taking place . it's also not an easy film to enjoy or to find any insights it has about drug addictions that are fresh . the best scenes in the film were when either harry or sara were reaching out to the other to send out messages of hope . by the film's end , not much substance came through all the stylishly and graphically depressing experiences the four main characters underwent ; what i mostly felt was tired from their actions and not wanting to see any more of their hellish experiences . it's a movie where the first half of it was clearly more subtle and better done than the more morbid and predictable second half . i can applaud the director for his visual style of filmmaking and the actors for giving voice to their characters on the screen in a realistic way , but the story of four losers who can't get out of brooklyn still seems very ordinary despite all the high gloss attached to it . "
328,"a spaghetti western that can't be ruined by poor dubbing , an outlandishly gross tale , dialogue that is meaningless , acting that's the pits , a body count for enemies that would satisfy the pentagon during the entire vietnam war , an acrobat who annoyingly can't stop doing flips , an obnoxious strolling banjo player with a rifle hidden in its neck , a drunk knife-thrower , one-dimensional villains , and an assortment of nonsensical gun duels . this film is so bad , so lacking in humor and romance , or any possible relation to reality , yet it is still mindlessly entertaining . there's a lot of spaghetti tossed about in this conventional hollywood looking plot but , nevertheless , typical italian action western . it's not for all tastes , even those who like westerns might not care for the amoral personification of the lee van cleef character . but you can't beat this film for continuous gunfights and mounting body counts . this is the first of a trilogy about sabata . "
329,"a disturbing drama , inspired by a true story , that rails against the hypocritical sexual attitudes of the times . the first-time filmmaker , philip goodhew , takes us behind the nice lace curtains of a respectable british household and brings us a story of repression , jealousy , and obsession . it's a well-made but grimly unmoving film , that dwells on an unpleasant subject , that culminates in a gruesome double homicide . in this rather peculiar m ? nage ? trois , harold is not only stuck with mum but has to ward off joyce . it's my birthday ! "" by the climax , it becomes apparent that this affair is no laughing matter . but the film somehow couldn't get past its laughter at these absurd characters and it failed to provide some pathos to go with the dramatics . there was just a growing emptiness that seemed to hang over it , which prevented me from seeing this as just your typical bizarre crime story . "
330,"it's not possible to write this review without revealing the key problematic elements of the film , though i believe these spoilers will not ruin the viewing of this film ; yet , some might prefer to read the review after seeing the film . this makes for a grim drama that is intelligently directed by actor tim roth , in his first directorial effort , as adapted from the novel by alexander stuart , who also did the screenplay ; the performances as well as the photography of the haunting countryside are first-rate , but nothing particularly insightful materializes about this sexually abusive situation . somehow after all the grimness of this story plays out and we see all the graphic details , the story still doesn't grab us emotionally as much as we wanted it to . the tension slowly builds in a household that appears outwardly as a loving one , until it reaches its expected boiling point . this doesn't leave the audience much room to do anything but gasp at the shameful situation presented and the dirty little secret that too many families find themselves in and can't deal with . "
331,"this is the first film to go from a super-16 original to hdtv and then to a 35mm negative . it was shown at the 1998 toronto film festival . jay anania's second feature is a very cold , intellectual film that asks the question : can we have a memory of what we only imagined ? this is a mystery puzzler without much emotional impact or much of a payoff . it's imitative in its minimalist style of a robert bresson film . it was intent on saying something , but you would have to be a mind reader to know what it wanted to say . though , she still is not certain if what she envisions is a dream or a memory . to go along with the somber and ridiculously serious tone of the movie , there are moody vocals by judy kuhn . the film's cinematic style is eye-catching and seems to be what the film was all about , but the acting and the story itself felt forced . "
332,"the emptiness of this film and why its story is so unsatisfying in comparison with its acidy acting and rollicking photography is because english director , jonathan glazer , comes to filmmaking in his debut feature from music videos and television commercials ; he has succeeded only in making a violent film that is ugly below its surface beauty . it's a film that discourages thinking and aggressively forces one to revel in the forceful acting jobs going on by the over-the-edge performance by sociopath ben kingsley , and the understated ones by retired nice guy thief ray winstone and brazen mobster boss ian mcshane . in the end , the performances don't mean much because the story doesn't amount to anything . the film could have used subtitles because the cockney was laid on so thick it was almost incomprehensible to this american's ears . there's nothing special or interesting about the story ; the film is pretty to look at and moves at a rapid pace due to jump-cuts and fast editing , but what happens is inconsequential and the film gets bogged down in its limitations . there were also several surreal dream sequences that gal has , but they seem meaningless and add no weight to the story . as far as the kingsley characterization goes , it was too showy for my taste to keep me riveted to such a pointless story . "
333,"warner oland's final appearance as charlie chan is marred because this is one of the weaker episodes in the long running series . the story was too muddled and not too crisply executed . for comedy , lee's misuse of french leads to some embarrassing situations and joubert's choppy english and inflated pride in his bumbling police department leads to some amusing moments . "
334,"the best thing about the film was falk's tough-guy performance . otherwise , everything was routine . "
335,"the gift is a supernatural thriller whose motto is : 'always follow your instincts . ' unfortunately because of that glitch in the story and the film's gapping holes in logic , i wasn't absorbed by this moody and atmospheric thriller as much as i should have been . when you see how the film will be resolved before the main character does and that person is playing a psychic , then there is something amiss about the story . the suspense always felt tacked on to all the psychic visions that dramatically kept the pot boiling . this ploy always felt contrived and the film never quite felt real . ribisi's portrayal was hammy and particularly uninteresting . the trial was poorly filmed and made a mockery of how a trial should be run . this whodunit had many contrivances and they all sapped strength from the film's already rather weak mystery story . the two things that kept this film watchable were the suspenseful visuals of annie's dark visions -- eerily recalling things from the dead world , and cate's gifted performance , that brought more to the story than the script by billy bob thornton and tom epperson could provide . as a hollywood film it fails to deliver enough punch to be a box-office hit , but as a b-film it seems easier to overlook the film's lack of punch to its story and accept its ordinary gothic story as possibly having more to it than presented . "
336,"a so-so noir melodrama , that can't overcome its limited script and unbelievable premise of a career woman who gives it all up to live a boring life with the husband she's madly in love with . what keeps this melodrama going is the understated star performances generated by raymond burr and sterling hayden , bouncing off the fiercely passionate portrayal stanwyck gives . kathy gets involved in an outlandish situation , in many ways similar but a lot more deadly than those situations she used to make fun of when she wrote her lovelorn column . the best that can be said about this story , is that it's not bad and it had some sparks in it to keep you awake . "
337,"rita hayworth has a bit part as a servant , while stepin fetchit plays his usual stereotyped role--this might be offensive to some . this was a lackluster suspense story , which at times seems more like a horror film ; and , the actors didn't distinguish themselves . but the film gave off some egyptian charm , those borrowed from a long list of hollywood b-movies . "
338,"an uneven production marred by some ethnic slurs against a black butler ( muse ) and by holes in the mystery story , yet had its moments of sheer joy and ends up being a below average entry but can still be enjoyed as your typical charlie chan formula mystery story . this part of the investigation was slapstick comedy and ridiculous . there were also a healthy dosage of slurs against the hindus ; such as , the cops saying : "" they all look alike to me . "" "" how many more ali baba's are there ? "" the film was not tightly scripted as the story just didn't make sense , making it not logical to follow who the chief suspects were and what they were up to . also , we never learn why the planes are being sabotaged . too many tacked on explanations still can't clear up all the discrepancies , but that shouldn't really matter to the die-hard fans of the series . "
339,"it was a little hard to find this mystery story credible and the acting was uneven , as many of the supporting characters weren't convincing in their roles . but there's the usual charlie chan formula stuff to keep his fans relatively satisfied with this weaker than average one in the series . "
340,"polar ( director/writer/editor : jacques bral ; screenwriter : from a book by jean-patrick manchette "" morgue pleine "" /jean-paul leca ; cinematographers : jacques renoir/jean-paul rosa da costa ; editors : anne boissel/noun serra ; cast : jean-fran ? ois balmer ( eugene tarpon ) , sandra montaigu ( charlotte le dantex ) , pierre santini ( inspecteur coccioli ) , roland dubillard ( jean-baptiste haymann ) , claude chabrol ( theadore lyssenko ) , jean-paul bonnaire ( gerard sergent ) , marc dudicourt ( le loup ) , g ? rard loussine ( c ? sar ) , jean-louis foulquier ( alfonsino ) ; runtime : 97 ; les films noris ; 1984-france ) a dark , atmospheric film noir from france , that followed to the letter all the conventions of that genre . it was properly shot in b & w , which gave it that 1940s look . there are a few more surprise plot twists in a story that winds down in a muddled fashion , as the characters and the story are not clearly defined . the film was too much in awe of what film noir is supposed to be like to have much of a breath of its own , but this b-film was entertaining and the two main characters balmer and montaigu had a lot of spunk . this limited film is a good example of an escape film that delivers some mild thrills , but can't overcome becoming a clich ? of the movie it was parodying . "
341,"this revenge film was fast-paced and well-acted , but its story is too far-fetched to be completely convincing . "
342,"a strangely crafted cult-mystery story that is not resolved in a tidy manner , as it asks the viewer to decide if what they saw was the protagonist's hallucination or something real ! it also turns out that there is no such a person as sgt . matthews . the film ends up feeling like a case study for paranoia and madness , more than it does a mystery story . i was absorbed by the story up to a point , but didn't feel satisfied with the vague way the story was resolved . though , david hemmings' convincing performance gives this film a creepy mood to hang its hat on . "
343,"a revolting b film noir , made before director robert wise became known for making classier films . this was his first venture at making a film noir . none of the characters were convincing . the story never seemed credible , as their actions were weird but not explainable . this was a bleak tale , but in a perverse way it was fun to see such a woeful collection of misfits . esther howard added her brand of misogyny to the mix by acting so daffy , and showing some gumption as she spits on trevor . the only thing , this melodrama hardly made any sense . "
344,"that is how the film got its title of "" the chase . "" it was a fascinating scene , darkly capturing the tortured mind of chuck and the stifling atmosphere of cuba during the mid-forties . this film noir is memorable for its dark , dream-like feel , as reality becomes indistinguishable from the dream sequences . because of those shots , this film became a cult classic ; but , it is one that is rarely shown on tv . they specialize in dark and expressionistic works , which this film is perfect example of . "
345,"a fine example of a 1940s type of film noir , as adapted from a cornell woolrich novel . the acting was commendable and the development of the dark noir world was very well established ; but , the case itself seemed hardly believable-- the dialogue was atrocious , and the crazed , genius killer looking down at his hands and getting dizzy spells was more ridiculous than a truthful presentation . the film had too many defects that just couldn't be overlooked , yet overall it had a mesmerizing effect--largely due to the imaginative direction robert siodmak gave it . "
346,"a monogram cheapie that holds up fairly well as a low-budget b-film noir , featuring robert mitchum in his first starring role . it's directed by the noted schlock thriller director william castle , who lets the story simply unfold and doesn't embellish it with the gimmicks he was later on to employ in his career of making horror exploitation films . they are still really strangers . evidently he's a better salesman than me . "" if you don't expect much , you'll be pleased with many of the graceful film noir touches this low-budget film has and the way it created a chilling nyc atmosphere for the story to be played out . it's a minor film , but it does a good job of providing some thrills and has its moments of pure visual delights : like of hunter staring out her hotel window and her face illuminated by a flashing neon sign as jazz sounds are coming from the street . "
347,a rather flat film noir that never gets that interesting . it's the simpleness of this tale and lack of any pretensions that makes it convincing but not necessarily sparkling . 
348,"a fairly entertaining charlie chan mystery , but with the new studio monogram taking over for 20th century fox the production values were much cheaper . it wasn't too difficult to pick out the spy , but nevertheless the film was still pleasing in spots . "
349,"it's a visual treat , thanks to the lush camera work of nicolas roeg , but leaves a lot to be desired in its wooden story and characterizations . the point of the film is vincent price's absolutely diabolical performance , no campy routine here . it's a performance showing pure evil and the reward is at the end watching him get his just desserts . charles beaumont's script was intelligent and subtle in making its case about devil-worshipping . but the film itself left me with a cold feeling . "
350,"a terrific cast does not necessarily make for a good pic . the film becomes ridiculous by the time of that unbelievable romance on the run and by its finale it becomes a hopeless mess . though , it's entertaining as it takes us into the modern commercial art world and pretentiously shows what it takes to be a modern artist , let's us eyeball jodie foster in the nude , and has dennis hopper do his usual eccentric character number--this time as a hit man who wants to be loved and play the sax like charlie parker . he will then give anne a choice : i finish you now , or i let you live and you belong to me . it ends with a bunch of silly action scenes involving a helicopter chase and an oil refinery explosion . since none of it made too much sense , the fun to be found in this largely improvised flick is to see if you can get some laughs from how absurd it is . since i only got a mild dosage of laughter out of it , i was only mildly pleased with the flick . originally made for european release under the title catchfire , backtrack wasn't given a general distribution until 1991 . but in 1991 it was given back some cut film footage and released on cable . i would have hated to see the film when it made less sense than it did now . "
351,"this was the fifth 'invisible man' universal filmed in its ongoing series for the money making sci-fier . john fulton's special effects are the unabashed star of this film . there was one very good trick photography shot of jon hall putting his invisible arm into an aquarium , the arm becoming visible like a bubble and then with water delineating his invisible face to make it visible to those he's threatening . but it is the script that does it in , as the invisible man is made into a heartless villain and the storyline was very weak . warning : spoilers throughout the review . before you can say have some coffee , griffin is also invisible--which is the first experiment drury ever did on a human . in this episode it's not the invisible serum that makes the man insane , as the man is already mentally unbalanced . this hokum story could have and should have been more entertaining , but it still had the presence of the legendary john carradine to give the flick some spice to it . but it was still a far come down from james whale's original invisible man . "
352,"a roger corman produced film that is a bookish adaptation from an h . p . lovecraft antiquarian occult work . it maintains the eerie atmosphere by getting into the strange rituals and manifestations required from such a look at the dark side , but fails to prove enlightening and is uneven in its presentation as the ending allows the film to go up in a puff of hokey smoke ( stockwell and begley oppose each other offering up their curses in an undeciferable language , until the evil stockwell gets struck by lightning ) . but this version attempted by director daniel haller ( monster of terror ) , is much better at getting at the freakish meaning of lovecraft than his previous film . that doesn't mean this film is good , just that it's better than the other version . while the brooding dean stockwell seemed right at home with all the weirdness his role called for as a warlock , yet he gave a boring performance as if he was drugged and reduced to speak in a monotone voice throughout . all the chills come from the sounds of an evil wind , the curdling sound of birds eerily singing at the sign of death , the sounds of water splashing , heart's thumping , and of the earth darkening as a shadow covers it . what failed to work , was when haller tried to reduce the visions to some chaotically contrived psychedelic effects . the film should be more interesting for lovecraft fans than to the general audience . i found it , for the most part , to be dull and uninspiring . "
353,"a superficial scare film that makes a feeble attempt to serve up hamlet as its theme , but that's a stretch . it didn't seem believable . he was certainly no bundle of warmth in their hour of need ! it's a film that is devoid of subtlety as its shocks are not surprising and its unfulfilling revenge ending in terms of 'an eye for eye' was poorly scripted ; it also failed to be convincing or scary . it was just another mindless slasher film . the film spends most of its time showing the couple pretending to be nice but still looking creepy . the film has a cold and steely look to it , as feelings on everyone's part are chilly . the house itself is smothered in a cold , aqua blue , as the production designer , jon gary steele , and the director of photography , alar kivilo , have made the set to look like a clone of the antagonistic and cold-hearted terry glass . there was no suspense because if you ever watched any of these formulaic flicks then you will know how this one ends . the film's slow pace for such a slight story bordered on criminality . this is basically a film that put a great effort into getting the sets it wanted to be right , but failed to get anything more out of this absurd tale . it was never believable , but its conclusion was even more ridiculous than it had a right to be . "
354,"this is a film that uses the porn business as its background , but is really about the loneliness and the corruption of an individual . this low-budget indie is mostly a character study of how 'an ordinary guy' such as paul could descend into the seedy world of porno all because he doesn't know how to get a date . he rationalizes his plight by saying in a voiceover , "" my parents said sex is a bad thing . "" he reasons the quality of the commercial porno films is so poor , he can easily make better films . the film had an anti-septic and unsexy look to it , as its sex scenes were not erotic . it seemed like a film made by outsiders , who took easy shots at the sleaze industry . the film had little emotional impact even though the story was exploitive and aimed to get sympathy for its victims . "
355,its saving grace is that it is well presented . it is narrated in a serious tone by reed hadley . 
356,"a clich ? heist-gone-sour movie by the british filmmaker antonia bird that has a raw look to it but little else to recommend it . it was bloody , filled with violent action scenes that should please the kind of audience that gravitates toward that sort of thing , and most of all it was very aggressive in attitude without much to say about anything but the criminals . it aimed for style and a maddening fast pace and got both--which makes it entertaining . but the film fails to get you to care for any of these characters , though it tries hard to get you to believe that ray is not a bad guy . this action film is all action and the talk is all cockney , which makes it hard for an american audience to understand . this gutsy crime film with political overtones fails to be convincing . it was not possible for me to believe carlyle has any political insight , never mind him being an idealist . it just seems like another mindless film in a long list of streetwise crime stories that are now hard to remember because they all seem to run together . incidentally , the film's title face--is a cockney term for a gangster . "
357,"this experience he clearly used in boycott , and that plays a major part in understanding the director's continual growth and ability to change . the film is a rambling , action-packed hollywood style ( for the most part ) , surreal , and politically motivated thriller--with car chases and shootouts . it seemed like an apology for a youthful error he made in his personal life that didn't have to turn out with a happy ending . he could have been shot by a firing squad and falsely made into a marxist hero just as easily as the film's hero was , valeh ( majid majidi-a noted director of the father/color of paradise/the children of heaven ) . the film never convincingly showed valeh as anything but a political lightweight without guts , so when he explains while in prison how naive he was to join the terrorists it sounds almost laughable when he says : "" i fight , therefore i am . but now i doubt whether i really exist , and therefore i don't care to fight . "" not a very good film in mohsen makhmalbaf's opus , but still worth a look to see how much he has developed as a filmmaker , an international personality , and human being since his misspent youth and beginnings as a filmmaker . this remarkable director was born in 1957 . "
358,"this one is set in modern la and filled with pointless violence , and with nothing relevant to say about its dirty cop subject matter . it would have been just another entertaining film that was eye-catching , amusing , and filled with non-stop action but for the last fifteen minutes , when the film fell apart and came up with a very unsound ending and ruined any chance for it to be appreciated in an artistic sense--even for denzel washington's fine performance . the way it ended made no sense , as this smorgasbord in violence had gangs of blacks , mexicans , and even russians , interact with corrupt city law enforcers . for denzel , this is a chance for him to show off how he could be cast against type as the heavy and still be charismatic . if anything , this pic shows that he's up to being a baddie . he's also up to the physical nature of the role as he gives a muscular performance , and he is able to talk the street-talk with the best of them . it becomes apparent that alonzo doesn't follow the book , as he plays mind games with jake and plants the seeds that you either do things my way or it's back to hum-drum police work with no promotions in sight . it was just too much slime to take in for one day , as somewhere after the first half of the film the shock scenes simply wore off and the film lost any dramatic effect ; it just looked cartoonish . but the twists in plot kept coming , and it took us down a seedier and more improbable path . it seemed likely that jake would have gotten off this crooked job offer faster , if this film had wanted to achieve anything resembling reality . the aim was obviously not realism , but to take the story into its own interpretation of the corruption in the lapd which was recently in the news . but the film's major failure is to go anywhere with this material and say anything that was revealing . all the shootouts seemed glossy but the final one seemed totally out of place , of the russian mafia going into action . it left the film to be hung out to dry as just another forgettable exploitation film , even though it was well-acted . "
359,"what we have , is a very cleverly done film , that is in it for the box-office and as an entertainment only film , and it should accomplish both aims , at least , entertainment wise , it is first-rate . it is a good mindless , violent flick for americans to take their mind off the more serious things occuring at the time this movie opened , such as the political scandal and impeachment hearings involving our prez and his lady intern ( and , you know how serious that stuff was ) . but do remember , the bad hero , is not all that bad , he is mel , the charming hero of countless adventure films , a guy who is full of good looks and charm , someone audiences love to like , and will plunk down their money to see his films in huge numbers . he also does the voice-over ala noir style , in a deep laconic voice , you know , like a sam spade would do it . the voice-over reassured me that he will live through the film ( that's good , because knowing him , he will be in every scene of this flick , and therefore i'm assured that i will be getting my money's worth of mel . you see , i don't really care what happens to his character in this flick , per se , since he is as unreal as the ones you find in the cartoons . what i care about is being entertained , by golly , golly , golly , gee ! ) . payback rips off the way a noir film is shot and looks , ( or maybe , in a certain sense , pays it homage ! ! ! ) and does it with pizzazz . the big city it chooses for its locale is chicago , with its tall buildings and el trains , adding a dark shade to its story . the only thing it fails to pick up from those great b/w films mood pieces of edginess from the 40s and 50s , is that their heroes were really underdogs , they were fighting the system , not out for their own ends and vanity only . this little difference is easy to ignore , but it is bothersome when i see how close mel came to sniffing out the essence of a noir film . but i'm glad to report , ever so close , but no cigar , tough guy . you just can't imitate that secret ingredient without being into the real thing . you were both great to look at on screen , you played your hands well , and most importantly , i enjoyed the film , it had a lightness to it that made it very appealing . needless to say , there was not much to the plot for this stylish film , but for those of you who want to know the story line , this is a pure revenge film . action scenes of this heist are super . this gag lends a much welcomed humor to what could have been just a pointless actioner . at least , the filmmakers are having fun with this one , and it shows . for the remainder of this slick film , porter is either getting beat up or doing the beatings himself . there is plenty of action , so don't worry you don't have to think of anything when you are watching this flick , everything moves at break-neck speed . these filmmakers have a great eye for detail . so , all-in-all , you have a lot of good action scenes going down , a lot of funny one-liners ( i laughed out loud when porter said , if i was any dumber i would have become a cop . you see , porter is acting very dumb going after the mob and its big bosses , kristofferson , coburn , and devane ) . i , especially , liked seeing devane , he is a throwback to the old noir foils . there is also an homage scene or a rip off , which ever you prefer , it doesn't matter to me , when porter rips the earring off a drug dealer's ear , taking a chunk of his ear with it . you can't help remembering roman polansky did that in chinatown , a true modern noir film , a film that caught the essence of that genre . the film works for all the above reasons , and most of all it works , because mel is great for the part . "
360,"another feel good type foreign movie , ala the full monty , that seems to please the audience , drawing in enough crowds to turn a nifty profit for its independent producers , and is good enough so that the critics are very generous in their praises , playing down the film's bland politics . a quaint irish village , replete with ordinary type of folks as eccentrics , a clever little plot with a few surprises thrown in for down the road , a bunch of likable locals , colorful scenery , wonderful irish pipes heard in the background , and it all adds up to a gentle and charming little film , with no deep messages or symbolism attached to it . the only serious flaw in the film , is a contrived phone booth scene towards the end of the movie . that scene absolves the film from dealing with any bigger moral questions it might have raised , by getting rid of the fly in the ointment , the one character in the village that upset its tranquility . they gave the film a rich quality that goes beyond the story line and the moral implications of the scam that they perpetrated . and , of course , there is a wee bit of gossip in the air . the twist in the story is interesting , and if you have not seen the film and do not want to know this twist , please skip the following paragraph and go directly to my grade rating of the movie . now tell me , how many films have you seen lately that can get away with such a corny but happy ending and still be critically well-thought of ? review on 2/27/99 "
361,"a cold thriller , exploring the exploitation of violence by heaping up a huge quantity of exploitive violence itself to make some points about what is the public's attitude and tolerance level for the random violence that is present in society . in other words , this is an exploitive violent film railing against exploitive violent films , if that makes sense . by crafting an intelligent screenplay and not going for the unnecessary showing of gore , much of this is done off-screen , which might be almost as horrific as seeing the actual mayhem , the director is able to keep the film arty . they have no redeeming human features , and their cruel intent is played up for the camera's benefit , paul even winks at the camera , as if the audience is in on this game they are playing . in one of the scenes , the camera is rewound when the audience is given the gratuitous pleasure in seeing one of the sadists killed , but even this is not granted to the audience when the scene is finally rewound . paul calls peter fatty several times to the mock displeasure of peter , tom , beavis , or whoever this obese , snide monster really is . everything about these two is a facade , their phony stories of who they are and how they were brought up , their pretenses at politeness add up to zero for an audience that is left dismayed , realizing that it is only their evil that is real in this film , despite the director's aim to fictionalize the reality of this fictitious situation , to reduce everyone to a cartoon image , to make it appear that we can grow to expect violence as a natural part of life . that part doesn't work as well as the director might think it does . the family is real to the audience . i am left with the choice of how to rate the movie , knowing full well that the sophist argument is , if you don't like what you are seeing , then don't see the rest of it . that's well and good . and if that is your philosophy on how to how to handle exploitive material , i can't condemn you for it . i would think that many people of sound mind would feel this way and will walk out of the theater . but i don't think , as the director thinks , in an interview he gave , that people who stay to see the entire movie , really need the movie . i don't , necessarily , need this movie . i stayed to see if this sadistic film works its point of view out , and i was disappointed that with all its novelty and games and pretenses to high art , it offered nothing much in the way of seeing things differently . the film is successful not because of its message , but because it is a well-crafted film , from a filmmaker who knows how to make films , even if he pretends to be doing more than he is capable of . this film succeeds with the small share of the audience it can garner , because it is , surprisingly enough , an entertaining film , and it broaches a subject that is very difficult to understand , that tweaks our interest in seeing if there is anything new to say about violence . and the hope is , that we might be able to understand violence a little bit better , even if , it has to come to us by way of an unorthodox position ; and , that maybe , since violent films are so universally popular , we can somehow see the human condition on film and not be anesthetized by the reality of violence . as far as the critical success of this film goes , i think it is merely a better version of all those halloween grizzly killing pictures we are subjected to--- if you want , a high class texas chainsaw massacre film . dennis schwartz : movie reviews ozus @sover . net "
362,"rudolph takes a rather cynical and tongue-in-cheek view of that art scene , capturing the mood and the atmosphere of that period , shooting this highly entertaining and for him , accessible film , in a dazzling display of color , representative of the art produced at that time by picasso , cezanne , matisse and modigliani . this was actually the first feature film he had in mind , but had to wait to do it until he got backers . his love and understanding of this time period shows up very well , as a result , he creates his best film to date . the parisian scene is topped off by an emotionally sentimental hemingway ( o'connor ) , showing up at all the right parties , sitting at the right cafes , drinking to excess and plying his craft , while thinking aloud , as his philosphy comes off as just so much drivel , with him appearing shallow and hopelessly american despite his presence in paris at precisely the right time for an american to be there . though the story might falter at times , with unneeded boxing matches and stereotyped tourists providing unneeded insights into the parisian scene , what never faltered was how well this film looked and how engagingly it caught the ironies of that period . "
363,"this film doesn't claim to capture the accuracy of its shakespeare production ( it even relishes in the inaccuracies it presents ; ex . , there were no virginia tobacco plantations during that time frame , there was no virginia ) , but the film exuberates in the fun filled spirit and the frolicking nature of the performers and the backbiting that goes on backstage , as it might have been in a 1593 production of a shakespearian play . i had no problem adopting myself to the cleverness of tom stoppard's screenplay , though i am usually turned off by films that think they can get by on that one note . but this film was witty and except for a penchant to become at times a cliched formula plot type of film , borrowed from thousands of other films , you know , the old underdog against the world story , with the underdog winning the big event in the film , in this case , poor will shakespeare against the establishment : that part of the film took away the fresh and innovative dash the film seemed to have on its own terms . but , i was , nevertheless , impressed by the carefree spirit of this romantic comedy , it seemed to encapsulate a feeling for those times when a great poet had to be popular in order to be recognized as great . that shakespeare was a great bard , there is no argument . but that he was at times too worldly , is fair criticism . this film is very clear about that , as a fictionionalized version of shakespeare or not . i was not taken as much with fiennes' fiery performance , as acceptable as it is , as much as i was with the rest of the cast , and especially , paltrow's very appealing performance . fiennes' shakespeare seemed a little too flighty for my taste , i just don't think will was like that and despite this fictonalized account of will , it still bothered me to see him look so lost , at times . you should talk shakesperian english , if you are in a shakesperian production . i found it to be an enjoyable film , full of life and tongue-in-cheek humor to sustain its colorful story within a story , of the needy will , on the advice of a therapist , told to seek some romance to regain his writing ability . will , all added to the splendid feel the director gave to this period piece that rises a little above a typical work of this nature , as the parts of the film that were fictionalized were intriguingly and cleverly done , for the most part . what was a lull in the film , was when its story got too clever for itself and resorted to too much ado over nothing . . . but , after all , there is something mysterious about show business that draws us into its bosom and allows miracles to happen for this not-so-serious look at shakespeare to be dazzling and refreshing , something shakespeare might have looked at with wonder , speculating at who this shakespeare is he is seeing on film . "
364,"elmore leonard novels have become staples for the movies in recent times , they become movies easily translated into money making glossy thrillers , noted for their amusing dialogue and smartly made stories . this film is no exception . it is entertainment for those who like fun pictures , placing no other demands on the filmmaker . clooney and lopez work well together , there is a chemistry between them on screen that belies the unbelievability of the story they are in . the magical attraction between these two , is very cleverly highlighted in this scene . she is intent on arresting him and moving up the ladder in the f . b . i . but to complicate matters , she is also taken with his good looks and charm . the cast is fine . the film is violent , it is sexy , it has romance and comedy in it , in fact , it has just about everything in it , except real intelligence , but then again , what results is a quick-paced actioner , that is easy to watch , and easy for the viewer to let his hair down a bit and be less critical , for this film is a well-conceived star vehicle that works on all cylinders of the entertainment scale . "
365,"these are not pleasant characters , they are sad and funny ; they are pathetic and desperate , but they are definetly not cute or pleasant , and cannot even remotely be thought of as nice people . therefore this romp , down this tawdry road , fits the acting style of james woods to a tee , it seems as if he was born to play these over-the-top , quirky , offbeat roles . and since , it shouldn't be that difficult to figure out , that this film is glued to its brutally violent story line , directed by a director who relishes sleaze , like some have pangs for twinkies , you should have a pretty good idea where this road movie is going to take you ( clark's previous movie was in the same gritty cinema verite style , kids ) . this is the 90s version of that infamous couple's story , just needing a bit more violence and some drugs to tell its tale . the kid very intelligently asks , why me ? what comes next is a learning experience for the young couple , as the kids are treated as if they were full blown junkie grown-ups by their new surrogate parents , treated to champagne and new clothes and lots of dope , but the initial thrill of being a hood begins to change for these druggies , who basically would be content just to make love and sniff some drugs , but are now heavily involved on a trip that is too much for them to really handle . their humor comes in small charges of underlying truths , as they tag along mainly for the ride into big time crime , still too naive to comprehend their total situation . the problem with the film , despite its authentically-acted characterization , is what can you make out of it that makes sense . since the film can't possibly give us much to say about bobbie other than conveying he is the only one of the four characters who might have a chance of surviving and living to be sixty , we can only hope that this kid with the angelic face , can somehow make it on his own . i recently saw james woods on the charlie rose pbs show , where he talked about his love for this film and belief in it , praising its independently directed efforts and sort of castigating the movie industry ( whenever i hear the term "" movie industry "" , i can only think in terms of business not art ) for not promoting this film and others like it that are honest efforts , refusing to make formula type of commercial films . i can only concur with him , just wishing that an independent film doesn't necessarily have to be youth orientated or about drugs or violence or sex to sell itself . there are so many other themes out there that have not been so thoroughly explored as these themes have been , and therefore for me to really get on the bandwagon of a film such as this , i just want to see something different already . i am inundated up to my tired eyeballs watching films with the same themes , differing only in the nuances and styles of their story , so that their originality comes intermeshed with one another , causing me to sometimes mistake one film for another . and i think , that is the most critical thing that i can say about this often funny , mostly bleak , derivative film , that was credibly but not compellingly acted , in reality , leaving no visual impact on me , it was too much like feeding on junk food and then going home and realizing that you were not eating a healthy meal and , besides , the enjoyment of it wasn't that great to begin with . "
366,"i was disappointed in hartley's most ambitious film to date ; i expected more than what was delivered . henry fool can best be viewed as an allegory of the good-guys ( non-conformist ) versus the bad guys ( the establishment ) . for hartley aficionados , his comedy is still there in flashes , his trademark drone conversations and absurd situational humor : a marriage proposal takes place between henry and parker while he is taking a wicked dump , this is the best and most powerful scene in the film . but the film is boring at times and belabors its points , and goes on for too long without seeming to be moving with a spark of credibility or in any one direction ; and , is at best , an uneven attempt to say something serious ( which hartley should be applauded for ) . but the film gets bogged down in telling too many different stories , such as , one of domesticity , neighborhood values , and the business of getting published . i wanted to like this film and i thought about why i didn't feel comfortable viewing it for a long time after seeing the movie , and i still found that what i got from the film were some chuckles from the zany characters , but what i was not clear about , was what else i was supposed to get from this film . it just didn't add up as a work of drama , it failed to provide a proper tension between plot and character . "
367,"when i was taking college courses in psychology , which is quite awhile ago , i learned that this kind of disorder didn't have to lead to such ill-mannered behavior as melvin displays . which is why melvin's character is more probably a combination of such obsessive/compulsive behavior and a case of rude manners . well , nicholson was real funny doing this compulsive schtick that borders on his just being a turd most of the time , but at his edgiest moments , when he crosses the line of common decency and reaches a point where the audience might not like him anymore , he brought the most laughter to the screen . this "" feel good "" sitcom looking film , goes on and on for a sometimes hilarious but too often obnoxious two hour and more , as if this was an important film with so much to say , that it couldn't leave out a scene or two or three , as it manipulated some twists and turns into the story line and managed to show melvin at his bigoted worst and then at his most generous best . if you believe such readily made reversals , then you are a better man than me , gunga din . if you believe melvin has changed or if anything is supposed to happen that is for the better in his character , then i guess you believe something i didn't , or couldn't , or rather , i didn't care if i believed it or not , since i sauced it out , real pronto , within the first five minutes of this flick , that the story didn't matter much , this was a cosmetic psychological rendering to a situation that could be real , but that this film was not about real internal changes , but about creating a slickness about its characterizations of people so the audience could have enough laughs at melvin's insensitivity to others and be diverted by that , and walk out of the theater happy to believe that melvin wasn't so bad a guy after all . what saves this film from itself , is that because the actors are so good , this film is actually a hoot in many different ways besides its great one-liners . the actors are really into their roles , getting down pat the minutia of their characters . melvin walks like he's a bit daffy . i love'd that slide step he had , something like jackie gleason did on the "" honeymooners "" tv show . his outfits were a bland middle-aged man's delight . he'd fit in on any cruise liner . the remainder of the film is predictable and pretty much made up of contrived sitcom stuff . so what does the schlimazel do , he screws it up by saying the worst thing he can possibly say to her . he even refuses to dance with her , which i found to be a truly funny moment in the film . but the film couldn't take a chance of sticking to this unsafe type of humor and went back to its safer plot . and the plot keys in on how melvin is reforming for carol , as it goes back and forth , good melvin , bad melvin , unsure of how rotten or nice a guy they want to make melvin out to be by the film's end . i wonder how many screening polls they must have had , before they came up with the right box office formula for success . in any case , some of my favorite lines in this flick were , simon to melvin , "" the best thing you have going for you , is your willingness to humiliate yourself . "" how good it couldn't be , at least , has a lot of funny moments to show for its efforts . . . i must say , i thought helen hunt looked a lot like meryl streep . now that's a compliment , helen . "
368,"without john hurt's magnificent performance , he appears in every scene and is very apealing , this film would have fallen flat on its face . oddly enough , he never goes to the cinema ( i could not even imagine anyone living without going to the cinema ) . since he has no clue about how these theaters operate , he mistakenly ends up seeing something called hotpants college 11 . what remains interesting to ponder further is the relationship between the two males . the comic effects of the film seem light enough , that is until the homo-erotic pulsations become overbearing , and we are left , in the end , with a rather awkward drama being played out , that is somehat unnerving to behold , made plausible only by hurt's presence as a commanding performer . yet it is tastefully done , but not as biting as thomas mann's film version of the same theme , death in venice . the message of love and death on long island could fit either pop or aesthetic culture , coming to the conclusion that love is strange . i believe mickey and sylvia had a 1950s hit song about that theme . "
369,"tango is a romantic musical , supposedly influenced by fellini's 8 1/2 , with political overtones to its otherwise almost mirthful mood , that is , for a saura film . saura accomplishes his musical numbers with a rather terse storyline , which means that if you don't care for the tango , you could find yourself bored with this slow-moving story . what is exceptional about this film , is how superbly choreographed and stunningly colorful and visionary a spectacle it is , as its cinematographer is the great vittorio storaro ( last tango in paris ) . one of the tango masters , explains to us that the tango is excellently done when experienced dancers can perform it , so there is one body and four legs in motion . there is lots of innovative dancing and , by mario , there is lots of deep brooding thought about life and what must go into the film to make it arty . we see see a wind machine and the next thing we see is a sultry tango being performed , sets are designed out of seemingly thin air , there are color filters for dance numbers created on the spot , a west side story look alike number is shown with all male dancers . the dancing is good enough to carry this film alone . but the story , that's another story , it just didn't seem that important , including the nebulous surprise ending , which in actuality , detracted even further from the slight storyline . the mood the musical numbers set was so convincingly dreamlike , that for someone like me , who was born with two left feet , i felt like going to a ballroom and trying this elegant dance , even if i never danced the tango before . the dancing remains in my head , and that is what cinema can do to you when it is so stunning to behold .

370,"this is a gritty , workman-like ww11 hbo made for tv movie , that is much better , surprisingly , than most of those kind of movies usually are , taking place in a battlefield in the hurtgen forest , 1944 , on the border of belgium and germany , though it was shot in hungary . the film is seen through the eyes of pvt . in a year when two epic war films were made , saving private ryan and the thin red line , this low budget movie holds its own with those films storywise , only lacking the great cinematography of those films , but its cinematography was realistic enough , aiding in the clarity of telling the story , that is highlighted by an engaging characterization by ron eldard and the other soldiers who look as if they are really ww11 soldiers . now this has been tried in many of the older ww11 films , but for the most part , it didn't work because the acting was not as convincing as these unheralded actors are . in such a short time , we feel that we know manning and know what he will do , and that his tough mental attitude seems more realistic than many of the other soldiers we see with a proper military attitude . it is hard to say for sure if we can like a person such as manning , but even as we question his motives , whether or not they are selfish , we still respect him as a man who will not blindly follow orders , even if he has to be insubordinate . this fuzziness about his character holds our interest throughout the film . each of the recent war films i have seen has its own grit and dirt to it , as they seemed to be made nowadays with a new determination to be more realistic and less all apple pie than ever before , as most of the pre-vietnam war films were . i welcome this kind of realistic filmmaking , and since war never seems to go out of style , it is worthwhile seeing how young men fight in such wars , maybe some day all sides will figure out that there is a better way to settle things . until then , there is nothing like a good war film to bring the war into our homes and consciousness , and this one is a reasonably good one . "
371,"roos's first feature film as director , is a snappy , satirical and hip sitcom that is not a sitcom , but is a semi-comedy . it stars ricci , as a bitchy 16-year-old , without any noticeable positive qualities , who begins the film by warning those who don't like her voice-overs , they will be out of luck . this film tells you how smart it thinks it is - that it is so cleverly written , that it can say anything about anyone and get away with it . what remained constantly grating throughout the film , was ricci's snide voice-over comments that were politically incorrect : insulting gays and holding a negative view of sex . she dresses in tartish , campy outfits , and is always smoking a cigarette , adding to the film's theme of being opposite to what is expected of a teen . ricci succeeds in her role of getting the audience to dislike her . but when you contrast the personalities of the men compared to the women , the men leads are bland and affable , while the women all have verve and fuller depth to their characters . how one rates this film , depends on what one is looking for . if it is laughs one is after , there are plenty of them . if it is a well-developed film , not a one -gag movie , then one might be disappointed in the film , as it tended to make one grow weary of its plot and put off by its overly clever voice-over . if one is looking for some deep meaning , then one will be pleased by lovett's reflective statement to lisa , "" that sex isn't just for recreation or procreation , but for concentration - that when making love , the experience allows one to relate wholly with someone else so that one can forget their loneliness . "" for me , the film was a mixed bag of emotions . since i am not partial to sitcom style movies , no matter how conventional or unconvential they may seem to be , i found myself swaying back and forth , liking some parts of the film and resenting other parts , and just like everything about the film , i was ultimately left in a paradoxical mood . "
372,"thin red line , the ( director : andrew marton ; cast : keir dullea ( pvt . the idea that war is insane is the underlying theme of this violent actioner , that questions the sanity of why men go to war . sgt . the film's title signifies the thin red line that one crosses between sanity and insanity in a war situation . but sgt . the gory combat scenes and the heroics of the men and the craziness of the war , are vividly photographed , leaving one with a mixed impressions , perhaps , wondering if this is what it takes to win the battle , and if that is so , is it worth the price it takes to accomplish the mission . the images of the dead in the swamp , tagged with dogtags in their mouth , was appalling to behold , it is a scene that should leave one feeling a bit eerie . this version of the thin red line is quite different from terrence malick's depersonalized 1998 one . it was a straight hard-nosed story , with no grandiose philosophical themes . its message might be read into sgt . welsh' last words , as he is asked , "" why did he take a bullet for someone like doll , someone he didn't even like , "" and he responds , "" because i'm stupid . "" this is a blunt statement , but after all the bloody battle scenes observed , and the heavy losses on both sides , it is a fair question to ask and the response might not be one that can be taken literally , but it is one that is wrapped around a lot of emotions that can't be articulated properly but can sure be felt . "
373,"i have not read the book , but as others who read the book have commented , this is a very difficult work to bring to film because the author's words are so literary imaginative and poetic , such works have in the past resulted in poorly shot films . that is not the case here . demme has sort of solved the literary problem by making this film into a ghost story , as the strong visualizations are used as metaphors for the inhumanity of slavery and the lasting impressions it stamps on the minds of the victims . the frightening and intense emotional mood this film sets is appropriate for the seriousness of the issues it brings to the table , and the deprivation it causes in the country cannot be minimized in any degree , which it isn't here . this is an honest picture , ever faithful to the book's author and the subject matter . but there were definite flaws in this film that detracted from it , such as the poor editing and pace of the film . the first and middle parts of the film dragged on for too long , as it just failed to hold one's attention to the story for long periods of time ; and , it was , also , shot , for the most part , in shadowy night colors making the dark screen unpleasant to watch . what was emotionally moving about the film , were its very striking visualizations , such as the use of the haunted house to make certain that slavery is understood as a haunting experience , that stays with people who experienced it , and that its ills may be deemed permanent for those who can't exorcize the demons slavery has thrust onto the land . the ghost scenes in sethe's house were strong enough messages to scare away any company she might want to have . but i was not crazy about the casting of oprah in the major role of the film , she was certainly adequate for the part ( there was a stoic strength about her that was needed in her performance , and she provided that ) , but she did not show a deep enough range of emotions that a more accomplished actress would have shown . the strength of the film lies in the energy it picks up in its final scenes , as the story clearly came together , and all the images throughout the film began to add up and make sense , and it was able to leave an indelible mark on the viewer that lasts long after seeing the film , in fact , the film gets better when you start thinking about it long after you have seen the film , and only unique , visionary pictures are capable of doing that . that she evolves as the story moves on and learns how to take care of herself , is one of the refreshing surprises that comes about , as kimberley's performance is very gratifying and touching to behold , especially to see how she matures and grows up from her very weak stature in life . beloved's performance is eerie and painstaking , i wouldn't call it a great performance , but it is gut-wrenching to watch how weird she behaves , drooling and stuffing food in her mouth like an animal , as sethe doesn't know how to reach her and love her , yet feels remorseful about her . one of the most powerful lines in the film is when the tender-skinned beloved , who would have been the same age as sethe's beloved if she were alive , says to her , "" why you have me ? why you leave me ? "" feel that . "" i still think that i should have read the book to really feel what "" that "" is , even if the film was credible enough , i imagine the book is that much more pertinent and that much more powerful than this very interesting and intelligent film , that views slavery in an unforgettable way , perhaps , in a way , that audiences have not visualized the evil consequences of slavery before seeing this film . "
374,"a zippy youth oriented christmas movie ( though there is no bing singing white christmas in this one ) marketed for the druggie generation of post-teens and those in their late 20s , that is perhaps a cut above the rest of the mindless offerings flooding the market to capture filmland's largest share of ticket buyers , as it tells its somewhat derivative black comic tale , ( pulp fiction type dialogue and style ) , fuelled by the originality of its accelerated pace , using the cool life-style in lala land as its backdrop , and telling about its main characters who either work in a supermarket or are involved small time in using or pushing pills . in this frenetically paced film , the innovative young director , doug liman , following his indie debut feature , swingers , shows that he has a feel for these young people and their problematic world , as he grapples with their realities , giving us a good look at how they view themselves , their job and their customers . the most amusing bit , is that we see her pushing aspirins and sinus pills as substitutes for the hallucinogenic ectasy pill , at a party , where those who are there , are so high already , they don't know the difference from one pill to the other . i though fichtner was the funniest and most malevolent one in the film . i don't think the film had much to say about much of anything , including the use of drugs , but it hit hard at being an hilarious film , with its fast-paced mood swings , its sharp editing cuts and frequent light changes , allowing its story to be easy to watch , and imbuing the characters with a certain attitude about them , that made their performances seem eclectic . i especially liked sarah polley , when she wasn't on the screen the film seemed to lack purpose . in any case , go has watch ability because of its raw energy , and the way it was able to get inside a pill poppers head and to convey on screen how hallucinatory his world looks when he is high . yet the film for all its innovative features , still could not escape , from being on the edge of sitcom and not on the edge of innovative filmmaking . the film's appeal is still mostly with the younger generation . they are the ones who are mostly likely to be amused at how the main characters in the story comport themselves , while the older generations might not be as amused , and feel put off by the lack of any character depth or real wit in the story . and the benign ending , not only didn't make sense , but seemed artificial and embarrassing to watch . it was as if this film after using all its energy in rebellion , now wants to conform and give the adults a happy ending . "
375,"it is filmed with calm detachment , in black-and- white , giving the film a taut look , as the action is sharp and ruthless , by men who are all business . it is interesting to see how melville could make a low level hood like gus , into a seemingly ethical person , that is , within the standards of the criminal mind , and be deemed as an almost sympathetic and , at the same time , pathetic figure , whose crime spree , though unforgiveable , will nevertheless , offer us something about him that is redeeming , that even the wily inspector bleu recognizes . this is not great noir , because the acting seemed jarred , but it has a certain tension in it that sustains its somber mood . "
376,"when i look at the deep south , the first thing that comes to my mind is their history of racial problems . what altman has done , is paint a picture of the town , full of local flavor , trying to test us to see if we guessed right at what our first impressions of the locals was , as those of us who have not kept up with the changes in the south or have not been brought up there , might view things from an outdated way of seeing the new south , thinking the worst of them , but now surprised to find that the only thing that has not changed about our perceptions of the south , is how dull witted some of them can still be . altman's other aims are to uncover all the town's little nasty secrets that is so easily hidden by its southern hospitality and history of racism . though , the tone of altman's film is always light and never very haunting . this is one of his mild films , he doesn't penetrate deeper than the story itself takes us , even if it is tightly directed , with no visible flaws in the storyline and the film's purpose , everything about it turns out to be as pleasing as the smell of magnolias in the spring , and thereby we are cheated into seeing something that could have been most revealing , instead we are offered something that is really too bland and simplistic for its own good , even if it is a satisfying film , it is still most easily categorized into the "" feel good "" type of mold , something altman might have winced at in his heyday of filmmaking in the 70s . what is comical or tragic , depending on what kind of a sense of humor you have , is watching how the crime scene is being trampled on , and the murder investigation done in such an amateurish way , that the investigators of the little jon benet ramsey murder in boulder , colorado , would look like scotland yard investigators in comparison to this sheriff's department . their romance is a series of lustful encounters , that is mostly comical , as it adds to the story , by giving it a more local flavoring . now this is as far a cry from the old mississippi , as one can imagine , though there are still some lingering subtle racial prejudices around . which , i guess , could best be understood as a very logical statement by those who were brought up in a small-town . the film ends on cora's spiteful comment to her sister , as she sticks to the story her controlling sister gave her , that it wasn't a suicide , as she triumphantly exclaims , "" i did good , didn't i ? "" the film's decency shines through all the past racial injustices , and maybe things are getting better in the south , at least that is the message we are left with , and i see no reason to be of a different opinion . but that last framed shot of the sheriff and emma and the lawyer and willis sitting on the dock fishing was a little too rosy a picture for me to take in all at once . race relations might be the biggest problem americans are still faced with , and finding a cordial way out of it is the aim of a lot of good folks . the weakness of this film , is that its over-all decency is not moving enough of an experience to make this anything but a mildly entertaining film , that captured a little something about the south's past and future , and made us feel a little better that we saw it , but did not set off any bigger sparks , or really create any excitement about the town or its inhabitants that is worth taking note of . "
377,"this is a true-to-life portrait of one of this century's most celebrated artists , as the film covers his work from the periods of the 1960s- through the- 1970s , as bacon's specialty in the macabre is examined , as is also his spectacle of what is horrific , but the film offers very little concrete arguments for him to be considered as a great artist ( we saw none of his paintings on display ; i realize that this was no fault of the director , since bacon's estate refused to grant permission for their use ) . that he is a great artist , is of course , a debatable subject ; but what is not subject to debate , is the brilliant performance by derek jacobi ( a virtuoso one ) and the fine supporting performance by his lover who is the foil for all his nasty wit , daniel craig ( george ) , as both exhibit a forcefulness and a subtly for their character that leaves no doubt that they have mastered their subject rather well , leaving no sharp stone unturned , so to speak . in the very first shot , bacon is diabolically smelling the pillow from an obvious lover who just left his flat , an image that reminded me so much of hannibal lecter in the silence of the lambs , and his extrasensory capacity for smell . that george and he are almost complete opposites , able to use each other for whatever it is worth , is part of the fascination of the bleak material covered , as the film becomes an exercise in excesses and debauchery , that is covered so wantoningly , with bacon referring to his relationship with george at one point , as the man who does odd jobs for him once in a while . that his precarious lifestyle often shines as brightly as his visual images , as his oeuvre of work is presented to us through these visions , rather than seeing it as on framed paintings , and this is stupendously done by a brilliant stroke of filmmaking , as the artist's soul was seen crawling out of the recesses of his warped but talented mind , as distorted lenses and mirrored images and shaded colorings and quick editing of the images , were all effectively used to enhance the eeriness of the artist's visions . i must confess , i never cared for bacon's art , though i was somewhat impressed with the raw power of his blood curling images and the deathlike objectivity he gives his work . but i was put off with his inability to reach farther back into the human soul and see what the whole being is like as the truly great artists such as a blake or durer can , who know both good and evil . to know one of the contraries is not enough , as it probably means that you can't even see that as clearly as you should , as in bacon's case , what evil is for him to see , is mostly felt as a raging flux inside , something jacobi captured on screen , that made this film a very special one , and saved it from the doldrums it could have been . it is rare that an actor can really sense the mood and spirit of an artist , because when he doesn't , it is to the detriment of the film , no matter how good the story is or who the artist is that is being portrayed . what comes to my mind is the risible performances of charlton heston as micheangelo and kirk douglas as van gogh , or more recently leonard di caprio trying to be convincing as an unknown artist in titanic . their lack of credibility as artists , were enough to make the films they were in seem phony . off hand , i can only think of derek jarman's caravaggio , to match this one in intensity and homosexuality , and integrity of performance . but whatever i think of bacon and his art work or the unwatchable moments this film had , and the pangs i got from his negative philosophy , and how the story was going down a cul-de-sac , i was nevertheless , still dazzled by a performance from derek jacobi , that left me breathless , and by a first time director , who is in every mannerism an artist and feels like an artist does , and was able to translate that inspiration onto the screen , which is no easy feat to do . "
378,"the male stars keep the film flying along . billy bob might just be the best character actor in the movies today . i just wish cusack would lose that coy smile he seems to bring with him in every role he has , it is starting to wear tiredly lame on him . these stars make their characters seem more real than they have a right to be , because the story is just too thin to carry much weight on it , except to follow its commercial instincts and provide the audience with enough obvious action sequences to keep the pace of the film moving at jet speed , allowing hardly any time for one to sit back and think about the real turbulence that could have been experienced about traffic controllers' stress from the job . the chaos and controlled confusion in the tower , and close camaraderie waffling in the air between the controllers and even their bosses was fun to watch , as well as giving the audience a chance to be looking over their shoulders at the computer screens they work with , giving an accurate and colorful view of the job they do . it is really astonishing that a film about traffic controllers wouldn't even mention the most startling event that ever happened to them . i'm afraid that scenes such as this one , are the only redeeming features of this comedy/romance that saved it from crashing . "
379,"an independent film , shot for around $250 , 000 , that lacks a cutting edge , something indie films should not leave home without . it sure looks like a hollywood studio film to me , but with a little bit of spice thrown in to give it some oomph . it is a story about swingers , which should be a revolting topic and is , for most of the film , nevertheless , there is humor to be found . the gang is made up of actors looking for work , coming to hollywood to be where the action is . unfortunately , we have to hear this whining for most of the film , until he acts natural , and bingo , something good happens to this dude , who i must fess up and say , i felt nothing at all for . and the boys will be boys theme is played here to the hilt , as sex is always foremost on their mind . that he is clearly the winner at the end , gives the film the right perspective it needs , not to fall into its own cool lingo trap . he represents the heart and soul of the swingers and gives the film a comedic tone , that at times , as silly as it is , is downright funny . what irked me most about the film , was how the filmmakers seemed proud that they ripped off tarantino's style of film , claiming everyone rips off everyone else . the problem with that logic , is that this film doesn't look original , it looks and feels like all those other tarantino clones . it smacks of wannabe actors being made into a film by wannabe directors and writers . if you have a strong stomach and can take the staleness of the story , you might find it funny enough , and actually enjoy it , realizing , in all seriousness , that this is the way it is for many heterosexuals , and it is always hard to change the way it is , no pun intended . "
380,"there is no doubt about the oppressiveness of the chinese communist regime , and this film , more than any other that i have seen , recently , presents the devastating emotional conflicts the communist revolution has done to its people , even though , it is not overtly critical of them . it is beautifully filmed in the style of a formal chinese landscape painting , using the commonplace to be viewed as something that goes beyond its present linear form , to give it an eternal flavor from what it might first appear like . the narrator tells us that in chinese , umbrella sounds very similar to separation . he is so insignificant to the story , that we never even see him . he mails most of the money he stole to qiuyi , and he gives enough for xiao to have a week's worth of pleasure . that is about as optimistic as it gets for this bitter tale of politics and romance , told from a woman's point of view . this is a very serious , stylized film , artistically filmed with many long angle camera shots , that give the film a depth that goes beyond the mere telling of the story , though it seemed to be dragging it heels at times , as the story just hit dry spots in it . its use of color cinematography was startling , as yellow was most effectively used to both evoke a sense of renunciation and hope . this is a most interesting but not particularly penetrating film to come out of modern china , one that is most blunt and cruel in picking up the human travails and emotional discontentments that the people faced in the hands of their liberators , but not able to say too much about why these hardships are taking place . "
381,"all the main characters are coeur d' alene's of idaho . there are many odd characters that add to our awareness of the native american experiences on the reservation , who are both amusing and talkative . but life on the reservation seems stale and confining ; yet , everyone , at least , has some material comforts , as they all seem to live in a house and enjoy their fried bread . film takes on the look of a road film . this is a film written , directed , and acted by native americans . it does not suffer from the usual clich=e9s of indian films , as it artfully weaves a story wavering between despair and comic acceptance of the native american plight . i recommend this film for its verve and very real passion it has for native americans , despite the triteness of its story and the fact that it offered no new insights into child abuse , resolving the father-son relationship only posthumously . i mainly point this out , since one of the major underlying themes of the film , was just that problem . "
382,"monument ave . what makes this over-used type of storyline for many recent films , stand out from the rest , is that there is no mistake , this is the actual mentality of the neighborhood . the film is seen through the eyes of bobby , the film's low-life protagonist , we are stuck with him , perhaps , to a certain extent even commiserating with him , seeing that he can't escape from being born into a life of crime , even if he has a good mum and doesn't appear to be a really bad sort of a person , just a little wild and rough in spots . that is the deep sadness about the film , it traps everyone into its malaise , and we feel that there can be no getting out of the neighborhood or the criminal ways these street people cling to . it all seems so pointless . monument ave . works well as a potently atmospheric film , that captures the mood of a neighborhood but cannot penetrate the souls of the individuals who live there . they have inane conversations about movie stars' tits and their frivolous adventures , while snorting coke and getting boozed up . but , even with all this bravado , they feel and act like losers . as the message is simply , that nothing changes here . "
383,"clint eastwood has directed a so-so , pleasantly watchable , leisurely-moving film , marked by two outstanding performances . the other is by kevin spacey . there were just too many zanies , causing me to overdose on them . so much of the film seemed to be taken up by these artificial and embarrassingly contrived characters , and not enough to the interesting story that was developing . to the film's credit , it takes no fixed position on the sexual morality questions that come into play . it seems that almost everyone in town has some sort of a pistol , as much is made of the guests carrying pistols to the party . so the killing by pistol doesn't become the big issue , but the fact that jim has come out of the closet , that does not seem to be tolerated in savannah's high society or by the ordinary folks who will make-up the jury . the film then turns into a courtroom drama , and sonny seiler shines as the silky tongued , good ole country boy lawyer . he just seems to get by with that cute smile of his . the film suffers from any real emotion , as it is difficult to be too concerned about the victim or the accused , or for that matter , any of the denizens of savannah . it is interesting to note that the real sonny seiler played the judge . spacey's charm and wit carry this film about as far as it can go , before the meandering story , and the non-mystery of the main event come to fruition . we are left with a colorful , well photographed piece , trying to subtly make a statement on morality . but that didn't work for me . yet , i still found enough good things in the film to say that it might not please everyone , but it did catch the proper atmosphere in savannah and provided an entertaining look at the people who dwell there . "
384,"it asks the question , how would you react in finding out that your world is not real ? this is a theme a number of '90s sci-fi films have already done . it seems as if the movies are running out of ideas for this world and need the after-life for more material . supposedly , i am being prepared for a film that will make me think . instead , what i got was a sci-fi film that left me somewhat confused by its being both a murder mystery and a time travel sci-fi'er . it was very difficult to keep track of what was going on , as the film moved back and forth between two different time frames . it was also difficult for me to grok what is meant by the creation of parallel dimensions and how it is possible for our world to be a copy of another . what made it even more difficult , was that the story line was built around the murder case and not around the more interesting ideas generated by time travel . yet , it was this virtual reality computerized world that left me dazzled with its engrossing ideas . though the film tried , it simply couldn't create too much depth for its characters . they remained tied to the sci-fi part of the story . they performed their task well , but their characters couldn't expand because of the limitations they were presented with . they just didn't have too much sparkle to them . even the romance between the leads was jejune . this proved to be a fatal flaw in the film . these creations have feelings and emotions just like people ; but they don't know they're not real . it is too dangerous . yes . the 13th floor , directed by josef rusnak from a screenplay he wrote with ravel centeno-rodriguez can be valued for its re-creation of a 1937 los angeles of fancy bars , booming oil wells , and a magnificent wilshire boulevard setting . all this ostentation taking place in the middle of our great depression . it was fun to see this opulent depiction of a town that was to only grow more opulent and depressed in the future . in this most original story , it seems hannon has made one too many simulations himself and now wants to abort this project . i got mixed messages from this film . i thought it was an interesting concept , that somehow didn't seem as exciting as it should be on the first viewing . i will reserve final judgment on it , since i think it could look better upon seeing it again . as for the flatness of the characters , that i'm afraid won't change . but i must say , i thought the actors did a really fine job considering the limitations placed on them by the script . . . also , the filmmakers did a good job with their use of costume and set designs . i wanted to like this film more than i actually did , but i couldn't fully enjoy it , for the simple reason that too much of the film was taken up by the uninteresting murder case . "
385,"this escapist movie is sponsored in part by sega , influenced in part by the death threat on indian author salmun rushdie , and it sure feels like a '60s bad acid trip ala video game that the twelve game players in the film are into . burroughs influenced cronenberg with the idea that what you create as an artist becomes a living thing , it goes out into the world and has a life of its own but is still connected to you . so far , so good . it is pronounced with philosophical pretensions as "" eggs is tense . "" and two heads are better than one . these could be some slogans for a game that has no explanation or purpose for its existence . you get to know about it only when you play it . to play the game , means you have to penetrate the body by means of bio ports , which are openings in the spine . that's a fleshy lump with several nipples , and it's meant to be stroked by game players . you see the obvious allusions to sex in the game's foreplay . all this game stuff is really not that interesting to see . the two stars are only mildly diverting , arousing no particular warm feelings for their plight . their aim is to provide suspense and a dark sense of humor , which they do on occasion . but they fail in achieving any depth in their characters ; therefore , they are seen only as being the game figures they are portraying . the main supporting cast includes willem dafoe as gas and ian holm as kiri . both in minor roles . he replies , "" only on the most pathetic level of reality . "" kiri is a game character who talks with a thick european accent . for allegra , her pod is vital , as it holds the only formula to the game in it . the film sinks downhill from here on . but much of the story just didn't add up and the virtual reality didn't look so hot , either . the only thing left to be accomplished was a surprise ending , and that comes as sure as a heart attack . the only thing is , that the surprise ending really came too late too save the film , and if you thought about it , it didn't make sense , unless you believe that the two best game players were ironically the one's who were really anti-gamers ; that is , inspite of their negative energy they were still able to excel in the game . he said , "" tell me the truth , are we still in the game ?

386,"what i learned right off the bat from this experimental documentary styled film about the director's search for his nazareth palestinian roots , is that in the holyland souvenir shop , the "" holy water "" comes from the tap and has a cross put on it to make it look authentic . deception is not a new thing in the middle-east , so whatever is said about this birthplace of the world's three major religions , bears careful scrutiny and should be taken with a proverbial grain of salt . that caveat goes also for this personal film about what it means to be a palestinian living today in a country that is hostile to its culture . it comes in two parts and with two different moods ; the first , nazareth : a personal diary , is nonchalant and disconnected . the second part is entitled , jerusalem : a political diary , is biting and meant to be disturbing . the closing shot is politically charged with the question of what does it mean to be an israeli arab in today's israel . the tv program his parents were watching ends and the station plays the israeli anthem and we see the picture of the israeli flag on the screen . this symbolically points to the explanation of "" disappearance "" in the film's title , indicating that it is , indeed , the palestinians he is talking about who are disappearing without a homeland . since the film was made , there have been many ongoing changes in the palestinian situation , with a homeland probably in the future cards of the peace negotiations . but this is the middle-east we are talking about . what is expected always comes with a surprise . the film is the most sensible when it humanizes the arabs it introduces us to , who are for the most part apolitical , middle-class , and non-violent . this in itself , is quite different from most films about this volatile subject . the following events that took place in the film's first part give us some inkling about the character of the palestinians : we watch a bunch of old women chew the fat while peeling garlic . one of them says , "" it's raining culture . "" the second part of the film shifts dramatically to jerusalem and the pace quickens , as the film also becomes more bizarre . this gives us cause to believe that she may be a terrorist . "" jerusalem is not unified . . . jerusalem this version of israel's national anthem sounded malevolently strange . it was the most powerful image in the film , offering a menacingly striking note . the last one finished nearly doesn't make it into the van rushing off on an emergency call . this segment alone would qualify this work as an art film . to use nazareth and jerusalem , two cities governed by israel , not the palestinians , and imply that this is palestine , is perhaps wishful thinking on the part of first time director elia suleiman . in any case , it is controversial , and a sure thing to aggravate the israelis . one-third of the film's budget came from the israeli fund for quality film and the rest from the national endowment for the arts . this as you can well imagine , making a film about this subject matter is very touchy , indeed . this film succeeded in being provacative without being openly a hostile political one . it works because it gets its urgent message across through the use of irony and offers a step in the right direction for people who live so close together but do not know each other and have hated one another for too long a time . that is not to say that this film is not openly in favor of one side over the other . but , at least , there is an air of civility about it that provides some hope for a future peace in that region of the world . what this film indicates , is that the learning process has to be continuous and have some room in it to make people look and act human . comedy is a good weapon against such racial hatred , and some of the sketches presented here were quite effective . the film's rambling , non-linear structure may turn some people off it even more than its politics does . as with most personal and original material , there are parts of it that remain obscure . perhaps , it is a more entertaining film to its creator and his supporters than to others . "
387,"a gorgeously filmed fable taking place in the steppes of southeastern iran , about the nomadic ghashghai tribe noted for the handicraft of their beautiful carpets . she appears like an attractive apparition sitting by the stream , where sometimes she is seen smiling sweetly and other times sadly reflecting the pains she feels in her tender heart , clad in a traditional dress , which is an ornate blue color that matches the carpet . to fully appreciate the tale , which is told in the same fanciful manner these simple nomads weave their carpets , one must suspend one's reality and enter into a fairy tale land of richly decorative colors and visions , and take heed as gabbeh sings her heartfelt song that "" love is color "" and that "" love is pain . "" we see the carpet as if were a magical one as it is spread out on the water . for those who value persian rugs , they realize this is so because of the all stories and detail that go into the carpet , making it an inspired work of art that gives it its intrinsic value ; it is a work of art that is unrivaled precisely because it is made without set patterns . the film was originally sponsored by the persian carpet industry hoping to have it made as a documentary . but if you can ignore that , you will see a film that turns out to be so endearing , that you will be taken in by the power of its raw beauty . this seems to be too much for the young girl to endure . i quite frankly don't understand all the cultural ramifications of the tale and what the exact meaning of its conclusion amounts to , but that didn't hinder me from being amazed by the stunningly lush landscapes seen and from enjoying the film as is . iranian films of this nature require a different way of looking at them , something that american audiences might take a lot of getting used to . this artistic ( not poetic ) film , is one that is not necessarily better than american films , as much as it is different from them . don't look for the usual hollywood formula contrivances to drive the film to its conclusion . this fairy tale film is a feast for hungry eyes ( i can't get over how the wheat fields depicted looked so much like van gogh's ) . but , with that being said , i would be remiss if i did not mention that this simple tale , is one that has almost no insight into modern iran ; it is a popular film , aimed at upsetting no one-- foreigner and iranian alike . if i had to compare it with an american type of film it most closely resembles , i would have to say a "" disney "" film . in other words , this is not a personal film , one in which the director's poetical vision is inspirational . instead , it is a safe non-political , though , beautifully shot romantic fantasy , that is more pleasing to the eye than to the mind . it is one to be admired , as one does a beautiful woman , but it is not one that invites further introspection . "
388,"rappaport's debut film is a black comedy that has all the eccentricity exhibited in his later films , but without the polish he was able to develop for his more accomplished works . that this film is an adequate entry into his oeuvre of independent films , is certainly true . as always , a rappaport film is marked by the absurd way its characters are presented and by its low budget . homage is paid here to such classic movies as sunset boulevard and johnny guitar , as these are viewed on tv by the neurotics featured in the film , whose lives seem more unreal than what they are watching on screen . there were at least eight other little episodic dramas , other than the one just referred to- of the lady who wakes up in the morning , whose only aim in life is to watch films on tv for the whole day . but the scene is played back ala rashomon , giving the man's version which is different from hers . all these episodes feed into the off-the-wall fun the narrator has in describing the action taking place , which he narrates in a mock serious tone . the way the lives of these lonely new york city denizens are presented , make for an original film , though not a complete one , but one that is worth seeing for those who don't mind seeing something a bit different . "
389,"it is one of those extra long ( 230 minutes ) and slowly paced films , that is a chore to stay tuned into . one deserves to get a c in audience 101 , for just remaining awake while watching it . it doesn't help that the characters are not appealing and do not draw us into their story . the thing here is history as mixed in with the loose telling of aeschylus' oresteia tragedies-- characters are even named orestes , electra , and chrysothemis . we see them in towns that appear to be shabby and depressing , as the years keep changing , as does the political climate . things certainly look glum ; the only cheer comes from the actors , as they are transported through the far-out regions of greece and sing their rhythmic songs of freedom , love , and sadness with a dignity and verve that enraptures the film in a very moving mood . you can feel the pulse of the times through the music and realize that big events are happening to the people of greece . the film assumes a lot for a foreign audience viewing it , that they would be knowledgable about greek political happenings and of the greek tragedies and of its history . the modern greek history of betrayal , revenge , and redemption are both the subtle and underlying themes of the story , as seen through the eyes of the weary acting troupe . in the most moving scene of the film , the actors bury him and start applauding him for the life he lived as he is buried ; it is as if they were saying , what a performance you gave in life . most of the film was unfortunately not as stimulating and was too trying a task to follow in all its different kind of historical rejoinders , even though this is a worthy film , visually bringing real life into focus , in a way that is unique and psychologically absorbing . there is no doubt about it , this is a theo angelopoulos film , not relying on cohesiveness of plot or dialogue to tell its story for the record of history . his camera moves around for many different and enticing angle shots but his takes go on forever , touching every little gesture and staying with them for minutes at a time without any action taking place , making the film a very difficult watch for most non-greeks . the neutrals just tried to please those in charge at the time . theo angelopoulos is a great filmmaker , but this first feature of his to achieve international recognition is not a great film as much as it is a vital telling about political intrigue . it is a film that is relevant ; a good peek at modern greece and how it is politically divided . my hat is off to anyone who can say they were enthralled with this entire film , not the pieces of it here and there like i was . "
390,"there was no visible difference between the characterization of a sleek photography magazine , frame , that is the subject of the film , and the film itself , with all its glib characters provoking an air of chic fashion , all in the pretense of art . it is a performance that makes the film seem greater than how it really is . the complications that arise out of this new relationship is the springboard for the plot . the two of them seem to have a chemistry together and their kissing scenes did give us a needed look into their passions , with the more controlling lucy being in charge of things and instigating the relationship to be more sexual . she has most of the lines in the film that pack a wallop . the combo of the three women with different intentions and personalities , plays well , as the acting here is really fine . all the actors were properly ensconced in their roles and supported each other very well . eventually the film , after being carried along by sheedy's intense performance , dies an ungraceful death from too much of its slickness ; it ran out of things to resolve other than by means of contrivance , and it was highly questionable that the "" art "" seen was really worthy of being deemed as something special . we just lost interest in the characters , the film began to look like a commercial for a magazine that wouldn't stop and get to the main article . so what could have been cutting edge dramatics , if the lesbian romance was followed through further , turns out to be a film not about art , but more of a soap opera story , about how three women , at different stages of their life , get together and separate . all the pain that is there , is finally settled in the usual way sitcoms settle problems they don't want to handle any more . which left the film only somewhat satisfying ; it did create a proper atmosphere for us to view these lost characters , and it did have something to say about how their lives are being emotionally torn apart . but we only get a voyeurs look at them , and that is not enough of a look for us to say that we penetrated into their world of mind-games and drug induced delusions and need for each other . the film just looked too much like the slick magazine it presented in the film ; that it wanted to say something more about syd's sudden sexual reversal and about the despair in lucy's life , but it just couldn't get it out what it wanted to say , which is why the film became a let down . its style was , perhaps , too beautiful for its own good . it would have been wiser to develop more depth for the main characters and show them to be more than the superficial beings they seemed to be on screen . being a talented photographer is not necessarily being a fully developed person , as evidenced by lucy's dissolute lifestyle and poor decision making . "
391,"there is something to be said about simplicity : it is unencumbering . to shoot a film about a weekend excursion , shot in 16mm and on a high-8 video hand-held camcorder and have it shown in theaters , as the picture jumps back and forth during the entire film , making it really annoying to view , and have the audience be understanding about this , means that this film , shot as if it were a true documentary , has captured something genuine on screen that an audience is craving for . it also should move it into cult film status for these 5 central florida university film school students ( 3 actors , writer and director ) , who should be proud of their achievement , accomplished by having a sound idea and made without hardly any money for its production ; the only other thing needed by them was the conviction to do their own thing and in their own way . it is the horror on their faces and the way their expressions show real apprehension that give this film a different twist to it than the usual horror story , which , too often , relies on special effects . it matters not what is seen along the way or how well they are acting , professional actors could not have done a better job . this makes the last minute of the film the most haunting part of it . it sticks with you well after viewing it , as you wonder what could have happened to them . it reminded me somewhat of "" picnic at hanging rock "" , that film also effectively left the disappearance up to the imagination and did not dwell on the details of the children's demise . this method of filming mysterious disappearances , proves to be an interesting way of handling it , especially when you don't have much in your budget and your story is razor thin . the flaws in this project are that it was like going on the trek yourself , walking over bumpy logs , getting wet , and feeling cold and uncomfortable , and listening to all those snidish remarks and whining that came out of the three . i would not like to see other films made this way , or see a follow-up to this film , a film that lucked out and became an enormous commercial success , which should make "" big time "" movie producers drool with envy . this film , just happened to capture the spirit of the project and was done in a satisfying way so as to reassure us that we were seeing something that appeared to be genuinely creepy . follow-up films rarely capture the same spirit , and by correcting the jumpy camera would not , necessarily , enhance the film . this film did what it had to do and should be savored as the popular cult film it is or will certainly become . it made a virtue out of shooting a low-budget and unsophisticated story in the raw . the other thing the film didn't do , was give us enough information about the legend . i would have felt more toward the effort , if i had more of a story and some more pertinent dialogue to go along with the scariness of the film . it was also hard on the ears to hear their conversations , both because of the poor sound quality and their endless ramblings , punctuated only by profanity . but this is overwritten by their excellent use of the forest itself , its twigs ( designed to give the film its terrifying logo ) and rocks and darkness , as in one sense the area was found to be beautiful , but when things went wrong , an ugliness of mood and environment set in , giving the film all the props they would need to make this horror film scary . i would give it an a if it was shown to a film school class and held up as an example of how to make an innovative film on practically nothing . but as a professional offering , i would be more critical , and my overall discomfort in watching the film would have me lower the grade significantly . though i do heartily recommend this film for the more adventurous sorts , and feel it is difficult to evaluate because of the thinness of the story and such , yet it has an appeal to it that goes beyond what we ordinarily look for in a film . that something special is what draws us to this film , but not to a point where we remain uncritical of it . the film leaves the elements of mystery about it , as its ending is very much connected to its beginning interview scenes of the locals , which should provide many provocative responses from the enthusiasts of this film , who will add mystery onto the mystery for this most dizzying and engaging film . . . incidentally , i did feel like i was motion-sick when i left the theater . i wonder how many others felt that way ! "
392,"barlach's grumpy demeanor , the strange circumstances of the case , and the unsettling swiss countryside , add a noir feel to this b & w film . martin ritt , who is usually a film director , plays his part with all the right quirks and nuances to make his role quite interesting . he reminded me a lot of peter falk's columbo . voight is a good counterbalance to ritt and to robert shaw's one-dimensional nazi-like villain role . he is able to bring an energy into the investigation , something that makes the implausible situation seem a little bit more plausible . but the ending , when all the game plans come together , left me slightly irked-- this easy to watch film , just didn't add up . it seemed as if the story tried too hard to make sure that man's sense of justice won't be mocked anymore , and i just couldn't buy into its easy solution , especially when for most of the film , confusion was the telling story . "
393,"ten days' wonder , the ( decade prodigieuse , la ) ( director : claude chabrol ; screenwriters : paul g ? gauff/paul gardner/eugene archer ; cinematographer : jean rabier ; cast : orson welles ( theo ) , anthony perkins ( charles ) , marlene jobert ( helene ) , michel piccoli ( professor ) , 1972-fr . ) chabrol continues to make original films in his own inimical style , some very successful , others not quite hitting the mark . this one is a theological mystery that is done in english , from an ellery queen novel . it is supported by a fine cast who set an eerie mood for a story that will involve adultery , madness , blackmail , deception , jealousy , theology , and murder . its results are mixed , being that it succeeds as something different from most thrillers but , it is rather chaotically done . at times it looks as if it were a b- movie . perkins' over-the-top portrayal of the manic charles is eye catching . the film begins to make sense if you view it from the unique theological spin it puts on the story . this unique film is both awkward and mesmerizing , and at all times tantalizing our sensiblities . it seems to want to question how deep our faith is in god , which is a recurring theme in many chabrol films . the answers are skewed , as chabrol is cynical enough to believe that the rich can get away with anything , including murder . but theo remains godlike , charming the public and buying them off with his wealth , making sure that they are only aware of his benevolent side . this is a film that might seem better the second and third time you view it than it does at first . "
394,"this is not the way the american dream is meant to be earned . it can only be attained by the honest means of hard work and fair play and through one's ability . kruger also has the best line in the film , when he tells chippy , "" i admire loyalty , but not to the wrong people . "" "
395,"it's kitsch all right ; but , nevertheless , fine storytelling by the former nyu film school graduate m . night shyamalan ( wide awake ) , makes this moody ghost piece palpable . this well-crafted mystery , is a first-rate summer entertainment vehicle , flaws and all--one large ( the story if examined carefully , especially leading up to its surprise discovery , would not hold up to careful scrutiny , it's all really hollywood hokum ) , one medium ( ghosts can't move physical objects around , this is pure hollywood invention ) , and one minor ( ghosts don't leave marks on one's body , though that was a ploy that added questions about parental abuse to the story , making it fit into a modern problem in society ) . this , afterall , is quite a burden for the lad to have on his small shoulders . haley's fright is convincing because he does not over emote the role but plays it as a child would who knows that adults don't like to hear things that are not understood by them . so he speaks in a low , almost hushed voice of haunting terror , adding punch and gravity to his hallucinations and ghost stories , making his frightful experience seem real . what helps this story out enormously , is that almost everyone you speak to has some strange tale themselves to tell about their contacts with a dead person . if you don't believe that , take note of the popular psychics , such as a james van praagh , and see how many calls they get about relatives communicating with those who are departed . most psychics would say that the dead choose to communicate with those who are most receptive to them , and that they might just be asking for some help from someone not realizing that they are dead or they are trying to help someone they care about see something that only they can see . i don't think this film added much to our knowledge of the paranormal , but it was an entertaining film , plus it showed how a murder can be solved by having a sixth sense ( something that police sometimes find valuable in solving a crime ) . the story was mildly chilling , showing the boy's visions of the dead people as real , but without the gore that follows many of this genre's usual commercial horror stories . . . this escapist film allows you to take pleasure in this supernatural hokum ; perhaps , even making you feel satisfied by the film's surprise ending , as you will probably not give this film another passing scary thought : accepting it for the hollywood hokum it is , thinking more about the cleverness of the plot than about whether or not ghosts exists . i didn't find anything deeper than a good story told here , and for that , the filmmaker did an admirable job . "
396,"what sparkles through the two hours of its production is the magnificent ensemble cast , who are able to make the superficial lives they are portraying seem colorful and their story worth telling . these four unlikable men indulge us with how they prey on the weak . these men are not just materialists and users of people , but are truly depraved human beings . eddie , as the central figure of the story , is probably the one who is the most out of it , either because of his heavy cocaine sniffing or his tremendous vanity or his inability to know the difference between what is real and what is false . because of the sharp dialogue and the ability of the actors to get under the skin of their characters , this morbid look at humanity seems poignant . its humor is in the form of sarcasm and scorn , which is a mean-spirited way to look at others , though mickey says he is flip not sarcastic . his retorts and dry comebacks are flip humor used in the sense that we are all going under , so why be that serious about life ! it is ruptured when eddie finally tells him with cruel honesty , we need guys like you in hollywood to make the bullshit look real . you're expendable . you do not matter . this is not a great drama as much as it is a black comedy that has great acting and intriguing dialogue . even a long lasting relationship between eddie and phil can't be viewed as necessarily a sincere one . "" phil is very safe , because no matter how far you manage to fall , phil will be lower . "" as an interesting gesture to the media age of the 1980s , drazen uses the tv images we view from the channel-changing eddie , showing how meaningless and bland everything seems on the screen : tragedies , wars and football games are all manufactured as significant events by the media but all meld into insignificance in one's daily life , with no follow-up search for the truth in these stories taking place . this was a tough film to like and an even tougher film to hate . its appeal is hypnotic , in the sense that we are overhearing conversations we shouldn't be hearing but we can't stop listening to them . if we met these types in our personal lives , more than likely , we couldn't stand to be around them long enough to be sufficiently entertained by them . for two hours to see them on film is also too long to be around them . an 80-to-90 minute film , honed down and made more mobile , taking away some of its staginess , would have suited me just fine . "
397,"to make artistic films in a repressed country is very difficult , but to make documentaries for an amateur filmmaker can work simply because he is an amateur and is not expected to be after something politically dangerous , therefore he is thought of as less of a risk to those governments . kieslowski went from making documentaries to making this fictional film , and in some ways this film is semi-autobiographical , as it is about what power there is in the camera , especially for one who is an artist . philip is the central focus of the film , as he undergoes a transformation of personality . it seems that even though he didn't intend to , he hurts those who are not responsible for what he does . this is a political spoof on the artist's role and limits in communist poland and a comedy , as it comically exaggerates the film buff's growing pathology and voyeuristic tendencies . the power in the story was in the subtle reminders , showing that behind the obvious censorship , there is a real censorship problem for everyone , it is not only in the conflicts between the artist and the authorities-- but , for both the artist and the viewer who must demand that the truth and integrity of the work be preserved . poland is a good example of such a battlefield , with the then state-owned film industry in charge of funding projects , documentary films are sometimes the best records of such history , unless you have the artistic deftness , like kieslowski has shown , to make a film as wickedly ironical as this one is and get it past the censors . since the film's theme has been done many times before , and the comic efforts of the film were rather flat , what made this film provocative , was the absorbing performance by jerzy stuhr , who would become a regular in many of the director's later films , which spanned a career of over 20 years . and for showing that struggle through stuhr's eyes , the film is memorable , though it is not one of the director's top-flight artistic works , yet it is still worth seeing . "
398," i'm italian , don't you understand ?  amelio's film is a political one , with a black comedic edge to it , as it traces the tragic recent history of albania , studying the dehumanizing effect bad governments have on its people . italy was flooded with a wave of albanian immigrants , looking to that country to fulfill its utopian dreams because of its material and cultural strength , but italy could not handle the onslaught of so many people , and would not let anymore immigrants in . this is a rather slow-moving film , that is chocked full of themes and universal messages the director feels impelled to get across . whether it is worthwhile or not to have a film be so politically motivated that it fails to be entertaining , is up to you to decide . the political aims seem necessary to see and understand for the viewer , the reward comes in images that stick with you long after viewing the film . therefore , this becomes a special film , not necessarily a better film , but one that is made beneficial for those who are interested enough to stick with this film's slow pace and all the political explorations that are needed to show how corrupt and decaying albania really is and how cherished the human spirit is , sometimes able to survive on the barest evidence of hope . amelio ( open doors , stolen children ) has so much political ground to cover that the film becomes overwhelmed with the misery of its exploration and suffers because of it . problems such as immigration , poverty , corruption , cultural decadence , ignorance , hate , greed , and a generation influenced by italian television are just too complicated and heavy to handle without sacrificing something in the process . what is sacrificed , is that , though i liked what i saw , i did not feel passionately about it . it was a cold but intellectually sound effort . the heart of the film lies in the change that overcomes gino . this nightmarish episode in his life is certainly profound and deadly . and that is the success of this film . we are forced into seeing the poverty that exists there , and even if we don't like to be put in that position , there is nothing that we can do about it . there are just no answers , and the film is left without a happy ending , only a few images of hope . "
399,"it is allegedly based upon a true story , one that echoes the director's universal appeal for everyone to end all their hatred . the bitter war , seems almost to be inevitable in this over two hour film , told in a detached style , emphasizing the bloody battles , as it clearly shows how war is both hell and insanity . if the film could be faulted , it is that everyone in it is used as a symbol , which takes away some of the spontaneity of their individualism , so the characters don't really stick with us as much as the arson of the villages does and all the other catastrophes that result from the war . this is a disturbing film , not one that is easy to watch , even as its gallows humor tries to lessen the somber tone of the story .

400,"now that doesn't sound too radical , or does it ? nevertheless , the church has not recognized that work and in 1945 declared the work to be a heresy . that is the filmmaker's version , but he's mistaken , it was not declared heretical : upon further research i discovered that the church only said it was simply non-canonical . as for it being unattainable and suppressed by the church , that's hogwash , i've owned a copy of it since the 1970s and anyone can order it in a bookstore . that the film doesn't always stick to its aim and gets mired down in unnecessary subplots , is what disappointed me most about this story that could have been . . . well , great ! that is , if it were in the hands of a filmmaker who was more accurate in his details . the film uses the supernatural as its storyline . this very revealing statement of how inaccurate all the christian icons are magnifies the point the filmmaker is making , that even the eyewitnesses to the event all saw things their own way and to dogmatize them without questioning them , makes for a very questionable religion . director wainright tries hard to make stigmata to be an unconventional film , with a "" hip "" musical score ( smashing pumpkins ) and a mod style of camera shots and montages . by using many different fanciful camera angles , he allows you to feel the pain of the crucifixion while we see nails driven into frankie's wrists . there are many other disturbing images , such as broken glass moved by a spiritual wind , doves appearing out of nowhere , ominous bird feathers , and dripping blood , which add , unfortunately , to the incredibility of the story . during the sequences in which frankie receives her wounds , there are a number of quick cuts between her body in agony and a crucified male , and many slow motion shots emphasizing the agony over and over again . the dazzling cinematography even makes the rainy weather and bad traffic jams of pittsburgh look like an inferno , while it switches gears and goes to the contrasting opulence of the vatican and the poverty of the brazil village , where the faithful flock to the miracle church . though there are many films ( exorcist , rosemary's baby , omen ) trying their hand in this supernatural and religious thriller genre , this film tries a somewhat different look to it ( but those demon voices coming out of frankie , sure sounded like linda blair's possessed voice in the exorcist ) . some of the things the filmmaker tried to do can certainly be questioned as to their effectiveness , especially the over-the-top special effects ( especially weak was the fire during the closing scene , it was overwrought with symbolism and inaccuracies ) and , what might even be a worst cheapening of the film , was the romantic suggestions between the handsome priest and the troubled girl who just wanted to get her life back and "" loves being me . "" in my opinion , these were distractions to an already complicated story , a story if it is to be taken seriously has to remain focused on what it was aiming for and not try to tell more of the corruptions in the catholic church than it could handle . the romantic hints between the two were fine to a certain extent , it made the point that a priest's disavowal of sex has its complications just like sex does for ordinary people . but when it went for overkill and tried to show how human the priest was , that he was more affected by saving the girl's life and giving her love than he was in preserving church dogma , i just thought it became too cheesy to show him in bed with her and ogling her like he was in love with her , that , for me , was going over the top . i have no idea where the director was trying to go with that . it just opened the film up for unnecessary criticism , and i wanted this film to succeed without those kind of distractions because i thought it was onto something . what it had to say was a rational response to such an authoritarian institution that cannot readily accept challenges from within or without . i don't see the story as an anti-religious film , as much as i saw it as a challenge to having one way of looking at religion . in order to challenge the church , there is no doubt that feathers have to be ruffled , but as i saw the film , the catholic community was mostly treated with respect and the essential need for religion was never in question . it is only from the film's ogre , sneeringly played by jonathan pryce , that we see a one-dimensional predictable performance . he is evil from- the beginning to the end- of the film , and how he ends up is just hollywood hokum , leaving me disappointed that the filmmaker would abandon their philosophical argument via the force of ideas and have to resort to making the cardinal look like a strangler . wainwright should have had enough convictions in the strong ideas he presented about his kind of religion being a personal one and should have let the quick lesson he gave us on how the church examines miracles , to be enough of a case against the church and let it go at that . i was mostly impressed with gabriel byrne as a priest . his low-key approach to this role was the glue that held the film together and made it possible for non-believers such as me , to believe that there was some faint hope for the church to actually be spiritual in a universal and unbiased sense . i just couldn't warm up to her sexy dumb hairdresser characterization , it seemed too funky and since she was the brunt of most of the special effects , it all seemed like an exorcist movie going on for too long , losing any rationality and prospective of what this film was supposed to be about . depending on what you are looking for when you view this movie , is what kind of reaction you should have to it . if you view it as a horror movie , then you are in for a big disappointment . this film is more silly than scary , and less funny than risible . but if you look upon it as a challenging religious conspiratory film , the way i saw it , a film that examines the past power structure of the church and the power that the church has today , then you might see a film that is more interesting than you would be led to believe by the way it was advertised and by the way some critics felt that it was their duty to defend the "" poor "" catholic church from such an attack . in any case , i thought the film was not anti- religious , just critical of churchly abuses , which makes it a disturbing film in some circles . in my opinion , despite all its faults , the film is still a thinking man's film . that the church has blindly protested the movie , is of no concern to me . the filmmakers have not disavowed the institution of the church or belief in a god , but just question its search for truth . the film raised some serious questions that should be answered by the church . this film should be seen as an opportunity for the church to see what those who are critical of it are saying and they should not be afraid of the truth , even if it means they have to change . it is easy to lose track that this film is a serious one , despite the mtv feel the movie has to it , and that is what surprised me more than anything else about it . but what makes it fascinating , is why the filmmaker thinks the church can be toppled by this new gospel . in the past the church has always been able to be astute and co-opt anything it gets its hands on , for its own benefit . a better film would have veered away from the sensational and stuck to the nuts and bolts of its argument . but with that being said , it is interesting to hear what the director rupert wainwright says , `it was our goal to present this story as an unbelievable , yet wholly possible phenomenon , ' and like it or not that's what the film does .

401,"there's something about mary is a very funny film ; it makes the most out of being politically incorrect , profane , obnoxious , and settling for an unsophististicated juvenile humor to tide itself over while the romantic side of its tale fizzles . it makes fun of the retarded , abuses a pet dog to a point of near death , and makes no apology for being so crude . there are many other things that the film does wrong , but the bottom line is that it is funny in a way that is not mean-spirited . if the film could be faulted , it is because it runs too long and seemed sluggish at times , and the romantic tale was pointless . it is funny because it is so grossly done that , at first , it is hard to believe how far this tasteless gag is going , but it is taken to the hilt , as the police and fire departments arrive and the neighborhood gets to see an unusual occurrence , it even ends with the showing of the wounded private part . that will become the running gag for the remainder of the movie . but , he is so crude , that even though he knows exactly what she wants , he still blows it but acting like a jerk . what didn't work was how stupid and low the comedy had to go to get its laughs and the whole romantic scene , that without the comedy would have been a tedious watch . this raunchy comedy , created by the farrelly brothers , who gave us dumb and dumber and kingpin , is a winner only for those who don't mind being grossed out . i must confess , i laughed a lot during the film , but i wasn't completely won over with so much comedy that depended on making fun of someone else's problems . it made the romantic part of the romantic/comedy seem unneeded . . . as a nice added touch , the film had a singing troubadour , jonathan richman , appearing throughout the film in various settings to sing about mary and what makes her so special . "
402,"a minor but most enjoyable tongue-in-cheek hitchcockian-like spy thriller from the michael powell & emeric pressburger team . the brisk pace of the film and its touches of quaintness , made the film seem very comically endearing inspite of the lack of any character study and the one-dimensional tone of the villains . the likable lovers , also , starred in powell's the spy in black . . . it was strange to see veidt in a romantic hero role , and even though he is such a fine actor , i prefer him in villain roles and wonder how much better a more romantically inclined hero would have fared in that role . "
403,"penny , like the audience , gets used to these freaks and begins to see them as very gentle and touching human beings , and her heart , not her sex , goes out to them . at this point , the story could have gone in a number of directions , there were just so many themes it touched on , but chooses not to sensationalize its tale , instead it becomes a very sobering tear-jerker . though there were some moments for levity , as when blake tells penny , "" maybe i'll see you when i'm single , "" the film , nevertheless , remains too sober for its own good . but all they see at this party are people who are less normal than they are . they have a few more contacts with worldly people , with mixed results . the symbolism here , is that even if religion means well , it still does the wrong thing even when doing the right thing . so it is not surprising that they are very effective and convincing in their peculiar roles . the female part of their menage a trois , was played energetically by michele hicks , but was a somewhat less believable role than the twins . the whore with a heart of gold is already a staple of film lore and she brings nothing new to the table with this performance . her acting contrasted between being particularly touching to being strident and , at times , she was not very accomplished in her part . the other characters and especially the mother , had either too small a part to have an impact ; or , were not developed at all . the intensity of the film and its haunting nature worked to its benefit , as it made us see the twins as they are ; the film pulled no punches and stuck to the compelling nature of its subject matter . but these same advantages also worked to the detriment of the film , as the story was , at times , tiresome and rife with too much territory in which to go for all the problems it came up with . the film couldn't free itself from all the pain entailed in the three characters , and kept making the story more and more muddled . an example of that , would be the film's ending , where penny encounters the now single blake and possible romance is hinted at , but the story just seems to be warming up as it ends on such an unclear note . this original film had too many flaws in its storytelling and never became an inspiring drama or an entertaining work . it should be commended for its mesmerizing style and enormous strength it showed in sticking with an unpleasant subject most films do not usually cover . the brothers had something to say , but perhaps it was too much for them to say in one film , even in a film with a perfectly eerie cinematography to match its storyline . it is a film that has its heart , seemingly , in the right place ; it , nevertheless , missed the boat on telling the sexual story it promised but never delivered . a prostitute not having sex with a client who requested it is hard story to forget so easily , as it seems , if done right , that could have been an innovative and moving scene and helped the film recover from being too bleak . the film got caught up too much in the tragedy of the twin's life and dwelt too much on the gravity of their situation without coming up with much more than heavy symbolism for its answers ( chopsticks broken in half , a two dollar bill as change in a cab and later on the subject of a lecture by the good doctor telling how if the bill is torn in half it is not worth as much as if it were whole ) . i found those explanations to be too trite , and since i was never fully convinced that this wasn't a manipulative film , playing on the freakish nature of the brothers even if not sensationalizing it , i left the theater not fully satisfied with all of the storyline . "
404,"probably the best of the charlie chan's starring the swedish born warner oland in the feature role . this film is distinguished by oscar levant creating an opera for it called carnival and william kernell doing the libretto . charlie is played with a subtle grace and aplomb by oland , giving the film its life-force . the film had a convincing atmosphere and style about it , and it had the peerless boris doing his chilling loony thing with great relish . but let's forget the story , this film is fun in an old-fashioned way , and it's many pearls of wisdom that come forth , such as charlie explaining how a madman and a genius are sometimes similar because they both live in a world created by their ego . now how can you beat that for hollywood's oriental-style of profundity ! "
405,"monument ave . what makes this over-used type of storyline for many recent films , stand out from the rest , is that there is no mistake , this is the actual mentality of the neighborhood . the film is seen through the eyes of bobby , the film's low-life protagonist . we are stuck with him , perhaps , to a certain extent even commiserating with him , seeing that he can't escape from being born into a life of crime , even if he has a good mum and doesn't appear to be a really bad sort of a person , just a little wild and rough in spots . that is the deep sadness about the film , it traps everyone into its malaise , and we feel that there can be no getting out of the neighborhood or the criminal ways these street people cling to . it all seems so pointless . monument ave . works well as a potently atmospheric film , that captures the mood of a neighborhood but cannot penetrate the souls of the individuals who live there . when they have inane conversations about movie stars' tits and their frivolous neighborhood adventures , while snorting coke and getting boozed up , it all seems to be a tragically wasteful way of life . even with all their bravado , they feel and act like losers . as the message is simply , that nothing changes here . "
406,"my life so far is cute , it has an angelic glow to it ; it captures the gorgeous scenery of the argyll countryside and the mannerisms of the eccentric well-to-do pettigrew family . all the performances are first-rate , its storytelling and sense of drama are done in a classy manner , but it is a film that i quickly forgot about when leaving the theater , though i did have a smile on my face . and i say the following in a kindly manner , this is masterpiece theater stuff , appropriately filmed for the mature audience that should appreciate such a blithe period piece . the comedy comes easily in this lush story , as there are the old-film standby gags for comedy : featuring friendly dogs and an adorable kid . the darkest character in the film is the bible toting edward . he is a most perplexing character , wavering between moods of being absolutely charming , to those of being repugnant . it should suit even more than it does me , those who like their art to be "" nice and mild . "" "
407,"the audience is not told what that question was , except that one student says , as he recovers one of the many paper planes flown with the same question written on it , "" it's corny . "" in truth , those comments crossed my mind about many aspects of this film , as i waivered about my feelings toward the story , as spellbinding as the overall film was , because the story , in parts , did feel "" corny . "" medem makes a symbolic point about relating the children's lives to a circle , where there is no real ending or beginning to their story . there are several other symbolic devices that are used by medem a bit more obtusely ( like empty gas tanks ) , and one of those images might even be considered prophetic , the repeated image shown of a car stopping short of a collision with a red bus . the solid story is befuddled with versions showing how the imagination of the two differs from the supposed reality of the story , which should leave the audience scratching their heads to try and figure out what is actually happening . the story stretches the coincidences to a point of incredibility and becomes more tainted with its philosophical message than a typical romance film usually is , as medem carries out the argument that both reality and fiction can be likened to a series of circles that interconnect through the efforts of coincidences that may not make sense to our mortal eyes , but these circles are present , in either physical places or in events taking place in one's life . as you might suspect by now , this film is not going to be clearly resolved . why should it be at this point , it has teased the audience from the opening scene onward and there is no reason why the ending shouldn't also be speculative . though , even in this type of traditional hollywood ending that has pleased movie goers of romantic films for generations now , the director has his doubts if there is any state of being that can be permanent . in the final shot , there is a picture of otto in her eyes . which one is the true version probably doesn't matter , as the director will allow you to believe whatever you want to . if you are interested in my guess , it would be the later version , the story seems to flow in that direction . most people i know , were put off by this slick ending , and question the filmmaker's real intentions for playing with the audience like this . as for me , it wasn't the ending that bothered me about this breathlessly beautiful film , with its stunning shot of the midnight sun and of the arctic wildlands , as much as the story getting lost in trying to be too fanciful , playing with my expectations for things to work out for these amenable lovers and then not delivering any firm message but what seems to be at first glance , only , a pretentiously philosophical one . and , by not staying on target with the romantic part of the story , but drifting around in circles , where the coincidences are just too much for any two people to experience in a lifetime , the film becomes marginalized and makes it seem like a philosophy exercise , albeit an absorbing one , but one that is , nevertheless , less dramatic and more melodramatic than it should be . but what i found strangely pleasant about the film , was that even though i was somewhat put off by the tricks employed throughout the story , i still found myself caught up in the dynamics of the characters and how commonplace their lives were , that is , if you could discount all the chance encounters . this made me realize that it didn't matter if this film wasn't going to meet my expectations about what should be happening or if its philosophy was overtly too oblique ; the film had a special quality about it that got its message across despite being off target . victor hugo oliveira , as the teenage otto , twisted up inside by the strange love relationship he is going through , was delivering a sensitive performance , as this relationship was intriguing , dangerously close to being incestuous , but was one that was not clarified any further , to the detriment of the film but to no fault of the actor . therefore , the startling ending to the film became less important to comprehend , because the heart of the film wasn't explored as much as it should have been . the strangeness of this film , is that its haunting use of language and visuals to fill in the blanks for the characters , still overshadows its melodramatic story and keeps the pot boiling , even when you might think the film is skiing lumberingly uphill instead of gracefully downhill and is about to slip and slide downhill in a crackup . but that never happens because the film has a special elusive quality about it that original films seem to always have . thusly , i felt caught up in the film's magical spell despite the many reservations i had about the manipulations the director used , as he ultimately proved that he has weaved a tale about the darkened lovers and their near-misses and made it into a tale of haunting characterizations , leaving something mysterious about this intangible and intelligent film that held my undivided attention throughout . "
408,"this makes for a different type of documentary , one with a less serious tone than most others but one that is fun to watch , as the varied contestants of different ages , sizes , genders , and races , each have their idea on what it takes for them to win . the thing they have most in common , is that they want the truck , the question is how much do they want it . he calls this event a human drama thing , rather than a contest . some of the contestants who were singled out for interviews , were the one's whose personalities stood out , whom we saw at different hours and in different frames of mood and in alternating physical conditions . angie learns that she didn't prepare properly for the contest and quits when she becomes disorientated , saying she doesn't think she would ever do it again , but she comes back next year and wins . what is magnanimous about the documentary , was that even though it could have gone for the cheap joke and made fun of these people , instead it takes them seriously and let's them explain in their own way why they are there . the filmmaker clearly saw that what the contestants were doing was fantastic and out of the ordinary already , so there was no need to embellish the story , and by keeping it simple , he succeeded in telling their story honestly and in a very human way . the result is a quirky , non-dramatic , human interest story about the need for texans to drive a pickup , as if it was their god given right to have one . and as benny said , "" it is something to see people struggling to get what you want . i'll buy that . it's worth a look , reminding me a little bit of that sydney pollack film "" they shoot horses , don't they , "" but without the cheap sentimentality pollack threw into his film . it played , for me , more like a sports story that espn 2 would air , where the filmmaker didn't know who was going to win and many times focused on those who unexpectedly dropped out , and part of the lure of the film was choosing who you think will win .

409,"do you know this voice ? ( director : so begins a film that is more interested in studying the nature of someone who could commit such a crime and have it escalate to a murder than in keeping the film suspenseful by having the audience guess who did it . "" why did i have to meet you , you are ruining my life ? "" this is the pivotal scene of this b/w noir film , as hopta goes completely over the edge and cannot be looked upon any more as just a pathetic loser who keeps making mistakes . what keeps the film chilling , is dan duryea as the friendly next-door neighbor , who is so psychologically warped , yet doesn't overtly show it .

410,"blood , guts , bullets & octane ( director/writer : joe carnahan ; cinematography : john a . jimenez ; cast : joe carnahan ( sid french ) , dan leis ( bob melba ) , ken rudulph ( f . b . i . another tarantino look alike indie , filmed in thirteen days for $7 , 300 , and it sure gets its money's worth for the effort . the filmmaker has come up with a crime-thriller spoof done at a hyper-frenetic pace that is as good if not better than most hollywood high-budget action films of this type . but it went on for too long and the fun subsided and soon became grating just like a bad commercial . but the quick pace of the film kept things moving briskly and their use of quirky titled chapters to each little skit , kept the level of juvenile humor this film was imbued with at a bearable level . one such chapter was titled "" coldblooded hotheads , "" just to give you an idea at what the film was driving at . it's a vintage pontiac le mans burgundy convertible that will soon be dropped off to them and they will be paid $250 , 000 if they allow it to sit on the lot for two days without trying to sell it or even touch it . a number of preposterous twists come about , as the film winds its way to its final payoff , where we see suitcases filled with money being exchanged , cocaine lined up in the trunk in plastic baggies , all sorts of high-powered guns exhibited , and mysterious packets of blood . the immoral main characters end up talking about what is right and wrong with themselves and the world they live in , which adds a nice touch of absurdity to the already absurd story . the film had energy , a ready made metaphor in the pontiac and the used-car lot , a semi-plausible plot , some promise in the filmmaker's ability to tell a story , some choppy dialogue that could be amusing at times , and enough nerve from the actors who at times improvised and got by with it , as it looked better than a film school film , which is what it most reminded me of . it was not innovative enough to be a superior work , it needlessly displayed too much homage to other contemporary indies to make this film seem special . yet it was engaging and at times very funny . "
411,"there should also be some nostalgia left over for the days of bungalow colonies as family vacation spots , for those who might have experienced that sort of vacation when growing up or raising a family . the moral question the film raises about adultery can only be resolved accordingly by the parties affected , and so what happens in the film's mild rendering to the problem seems credible at first glance , as it is put forth in a way that worked out for the film's sake but might not have seemed correct for many a viewer , or at least , it was not important enough to be resolved by the film , even if that clash was supposedly the whole point of the film . the acting was convincing , the story had a nice feel to it , and it followed along with the historical mood the country was going through at that time . what the film lacked , was resolution . i thought that the fleeting affair she had with the long-haired sculptured adonis figure , certainly satisfied her sexual needs but the bigger moral question of adultery was never even attempted to be answered with any kind of satisfactory response , which left me believing that the liaison was the thing here , just like in those romantic pulp fiction books that are an easy read , with nothing more to tax your mind . "
412,"the story has a certain charm to it and a genuineness that shows through in the telling of the story , as it moves seamlessly from comedy into suspense , at the drop of a briefcase . nick veronis makes his debut as actor/writer/director in this very refreshing story . it's also a buddy movie and the buddies all have an affability of their own and seem like the sort of people you would see in real life and not on a hollywood set . the film offers many keen observations about how these young people react to the tight situation they are in , and it examines in an amusing way their life-style and esprit de corps , but the story keeps coming back to jimmy and how he is prepared to do anything to make his film , even if it means stepping on a few toes of some gangsters . this is an energetic film , it has lots of black comedy and incisive dialogue to recommend it to an audience appreciative of indie films .

413,"takeshi "" beat "" kitano is certainly a unique director , whose absurdist style of filmmaking is readily recognizable , achieving auteur status . he has a fascination with gangsters , violence , and in presenting his quirky black humor in a most compelling way . his films are always visually startling , with a bevy of bizarre shots , and , so far , all his films have gotten away with a mindless but intriguing storyline . he is so fascinating to watch , that it is shame we couldn't see more of his lunacy ; instead , the supporting cast , funny as they are with their deadpan humor , nevertheless , they cannot carry the film , and kitano has chosen to center the film around them . fortunately , there are plenty of his usual visual treats in this film , that make the film seem special anyhow . kitano , also , relishes giving women roles that could be considered demeaning . though it is sickeningly amusing to see how rough-shod he treats them in so callous and an ungentlemanly manner , that one might be caught ruefully laughing at them getting dumped on and treated as garbage , and supposedly liking it and coming back for more , it still shows that he doesn't really know how to portray women on screen . maybe he knows something i don't know . but there is never any romance in his films that amount to anything , and this film is no exception . this mindless act escalates on both sides , and , of course , it makes no sense . this is all casually done , as if this kind of mayhem was as natural as eating rice cakes . if there is any point to this story , and i am not sure there is , but the message here might be , that friends are needed to help you out , no one is immune from the insanity that is in the air , because according to kitano , insanity is catching . and , if taking a stand alone against many , you are in deep trouble . somehow this visual feast of a film was strangely appealing and original in all aspects of filmmaking . so let me say bravo to the one time stand-up comedian who doesn't know how to make a safe film , and tip my eagle baseball hat to him , not only for hitting a home run , but showing that one can hit a home run but not score the needed winning run by running past the man who was on base . a cult film delight as a cruel form of entertainment , that is not for all tastes , naturally . incidently , the american title to the film , boiling point , is misleading : in japanese the title refers in slang to a baseball score .

414,"the brilliant cinematography in this slasher thriller is what takes it out of the ordinary realm of such films and makes it into a diverting and more artistic venture . esteemed cult director , donald cammell ( performance/demon seed/the wild side ) , has never quite lived up to the potential he showed in the masterpiece he co-directed , "" performance . "" what is meant by the film's title , refers to an apache legend about those who look into the eye of violence close-up , which allows the mystical eye to have his eye on you . as a film about mysticism , it fails badly to materialize as anything but nonsense . for a film that has such a weak story and fails to be absorbing as a character study , this is , nevertheless , a well-crafted visual spectacle , featuring an array of beautifully stylized color co-ordinated scenes and out-of-the-way shots , that have little to do with the story , but overall they create a bizarre atmosphere that fits the brooding mood of the film to a tee . if it is the mystery story itself that you are looking for , i'm afraid you will be disappointed , as it adds up to nothing much . but in those visual shots . . . it might disappoint some , who think cammell could have made something more than a slasher film ; but , then again , his strength is through his eye , no matter how distorted it may be , and even in this low-rent type of film , his images remain strong and his themes have a strange complexity about them , enabling the film to be oddly effective , even when it shouldn't be .

415,"a very troubling film , regarding the crimes of martha beck and raymond fernandez , who were executed in 1951 . it offers a vivid picture of greed , vanity , and pure evil . this film differs from the former in its more gaudy and cartoonish style and careful camerawork taking note of the reflecting light patterns that surrounded the couple , and with a penchant for showing the troubled characters gazing into mirrors , as if they were looking for their lost souls . the grim nature of its story was made less austere by the film's black comedy , which was a staple of both films . as diabolical as this film was , in showing the couple to be moral degenerates with no conscience or redeeming qualities , the earlier film , the one i still prefer , takes a slightly different emphasis , holding a more cult-like look at the grotesque couple , while also showing them to be heartless weirdos without any redeeming qualities . this is match made in hell . the most important thing in nico's life is to look good . say that this cowardly couple has some psychological problems , is to say a mouthful . i think that little touch of vanity got weary after a while , and the director just made too much of it . it lost its humorous quality by then in the story .

417,"this stuff is all hush-hush . gee ! by this time the major and barbara show a strong affection for each other , and a little romance is blooming without even a kiss or holding of hands taking place , though there is one scene where she comes out of the shower with just a towel on and you know that got the major's attention . now this romance could be taken for a serious one . it seems that the major is the only one on the base who does any work . so , you see , the major is a very busy man . it now becomes obvious that the professor is involved in this mystery , and the fun part of the film begins , or some might think the film really goes out of whack from here on . but things are not that simple , the atomic plant malfunctions and can't be shut down , and to my delight , the creatures become visible because of the increase in atomic power in the nuclear plant . what's viewed on screen are brains with a spinal cord attacking everybody they see , killing all the people manning the nuclear plant . there are great special effects , using stop-motion animation to show the brains moving around ! as entertainment value , this film should hit the right spot : it's a screamer . as anything greater , the story made little sense . this is just another mutant b- flick that is missing most of its brain .

"" bob's conversations with the wheel-chaired bound professor are terse but highlight the film , as they are delivered with proper horror film affect . the film's not real frightening because there is a flatness to it ; but , it has its entertaining moments , and is a must see for karloff fans .

420,"if you like nonsense musicals with plenty of singing , beautiful set designs , fantastic colors , sex , witchcraft , and a fairy tale charm to it , then you will probably like this film , which is in many ways like flying down to rio . though , i was hoping it could be more like those jacques demy or jacques rivette musicals , exhibiting a little more substance . but if you are in a mood for some light entertainment , this zany musical has plenty of oomph and should satisfy your latino appetite for something that is easy and sexy to look at . the little known director of this film , hails from venezuela , which gives this french film a very natural latin twist to its story and music . the this is all done as harmless and silly fun , much in the vein of a long list of hollywood and french musicals , films that i was never partial to . for what it's worth , this film is an entertaining and colorful spectacle , and with enough verve in it to make it seem inventive . "
421,"this romantic comedy about the love life of comic book writers feels like a sitcom because that is what it basically is , not withstanding , that it pushes the envelope further out by having characters in it who are more sexually active than the usual sitcom . its story is also a bit more arresting . its strongest asset being the quick-witted and acidy dialogue it brings to the table by its capable cast who are most able to deliver those punch lines . in this scene we get a good dose of the ambiance of the comic book world and we get a chance to see what their readers are like and of how serious the writers are about the work they do . banky has a blast with this explanation . our hero is not a liberated hero , but it is his flaws that give him credibility . the film gives this a surprising psychological meaning . the chasing amy is a moral fable . this scene was not needed , as the story itself was simple enough to follow . we did not need a ready made explanation of the film from the director . not everything worked or made sense , but the characters and their problems seemed real . and , the dialogue hit the mark more often than not . this is smith's third film about the travails of young people growing up in new jersey and influenced by "" pop "" culture . what i didn't like about the film , is that despite its attempts not to be viewed as a sitcom , that is what this film is , even if its mature story line adds more weight to it . sitcoms are just not the way i like to see drama unfolding , as it always leaves me thinking that things are still being dumbed down , that even though , these are characters we usually do not see on the screen and it is refreshing to see them ; we are , nevertheless , not going any deeper psychologically with this story and with character portrayal than other sitcoms go . smith's film does give us a real sense of a relationship and the struggle it takes to make it work , but there is still an air of superficiality about its presentation . "
422,"the film's major fault is that it is too stagy a production . he is weird , slow-witted and obnoxious , but he does not have the same kind of depraved sexual relationship with parker as josh does . she is cute but not too swift , and is as straight as an arrow . i found tori's performance to be lacking in spunk , especially when compared to the fine ensemble cast she is surrounded by . how much you like this film depends on your idea of comedy and how much tolerance you have for "" sick humor . "" if this kind of parody over the tragedy that rocked the country , upsets you , and you think it is in bad taste , then you shouldn't see this film . if your reaction is like mine , then you will find that when this picture is on the mark , which is quite often , you will laugh aloud , and when it misses the mark , you might even wince . the real flaw in the film is when it starts to take its comedy seriously and thinks it has to explain itself and come up with an academic explanation for the parker character's obsession . it would have been better to have just ridden the comedy out and have been criticized by those who didn't like where the comedy was going . it seemed unnecessary to have changed the mood of the film and all of sudden offered some psychological explanations for jacki-o' behavior . the staple in the film was parker posey , the princess of the indie film . she , simply , steals the film . "
423,"this film , based on carl sagan's novel , is a mixture of sci-fi , romance , sentimentality , and drama , brought to screen by the director of forreset gump . it relies on its ideas and its mild convictions to sustain its powerful but soppy story , rather than its special effects , contrary to many modern films that have just become special effect vehicles . governments seem to trust this type and like to put them in charge of things . attraction between them is overshadowed by idealogical differences , and nothing can get in the way of ellie's belief in evolution , not even this hunk who is a ridiculously loopy caricature of a religious zealot , one of those religious johnny-come-lately types . here the story turns melodramatic and goes off on too many different tangents to adequately keep its focus on its primary aim-- that there is life in outer space . for these scenes , the film should have used the dictum from occam's razor : the simplest way to do something is the best way . as a sci-fi'er , with a good storyline that tends to get too schmaltzy , this film is up to par with those star wars films , but is outclassed by 2001 . sagan would have been proud of the accuracy and content of this work had he lived to see the film through to its conclusion , but i don't think he would have been to happy with the elementary-school theological debate between the space pioneer and the government officials . i think the best answer a scientist could give in this scenario , was not given by jodi . . . but , a steven hawkings might have said that it is through these scientific machines that we will come closest to reading the mind of god . it is a thing of great beauty . at least , this is what my science friends tell me is the more typical attitude toward god in their community . "
424,"his predilection is for most of his heroes to be deformed or have suffered heavily at the hands of another . the simplistic plot can be seen from a mile away as to how it will develop and turn out . it exhibits the kind of racist outlook shown to the natives that movies will not allow today . what distinguishes this film , is the virtuoso performance of chaney as a villain , as he transforms himself into a fearsome character , and his expressive face keeps changing with his different moods . he could be tender and fatherly at one moment and the next moment he could have a menacing look . he also has a flare for wearing just the right makeup for the part he plays ; here he looks almost bald , giving him the extra chilling look he needed to have for the part . his speciality in the grotesque made him a silent star icon , someone who will not be forgotten , who could get the audience's attention by either inspiring them with the vulnerability of his character or by his morbid sense of getting into his character . the film is a strangely curious relic , not because of the story , but because he played this legless man so convincingly . "
425,"i'm not a fan of glam rock , my musical partialities are more in the line for classical music or '60s rock . glam is the kind of music that is pretty to look at for short periods of time but when more closely scrutinized could turn ugly . that is both the virtue and problem with this entertaining and stylish celebration of the rock music scene by todd haynes ( safe/poison ) , that has the right musical feel but offers no depth and little character development in its story . this fictionalized story is a thin disguise for david bowie's bio , and it was able along the way to rip-off the citizen kane way of telling a biography in a fictionalized way . and if that weren't enough of a splash in the water of cause c ? l ? bre , haynes throws a bit of the oscar wilde biography into the fiction presented . the film works best as a music video and if you like the music , you'll probably love the film . as a film it was a colorful spectacle , wonderfully performed , very energetic , and it had some witty dialogue ; but , it failed to tell a cohesive story and failed to capture what that period of the 1970s was about . it was hard to tell what haynes was trying to expose or tell about this fictionalized bowie-ziggy stardust-like character . it was all vague and superficial , i suppose , just like glamor is . besides , i don't really know how worthwhile it is to uncover his mystery life-like who cares ! anyway , he wasn't made into an interesting character by slade's characterization of him-i think david bowie is a much more interesting character than brian slade . if you don't mind having an empty feeling after seeing a film , then this one could be your kind of nourishment . the suggestion made was that these performers are role models and influence many teens-for good or bad . unfortunately , the film did not pick up on that thread of the story , as it continued on in its glitzy musical style . curt , "" if you don't look at the world . "" i guess something must have happened to the two performing artists along the way , but it must have happened offscreen , because it didn't happen onscreen . "
426,"two things could be said for sure about this movie , which uses mostly nonprofessional actors , that it is disturbingly romantic and it is troublingly inconclusive . there is no telling narrative to sink one's teeth into the story , but the visceral images and the emptiness of the youth's quest are fully explored in an original way , by the first-time director , manuel pradal . metaphors abound in this film , so much so that one could overdose on all the heavily intended poetical images and still not find much to sate one's hunger for what this film is ultimately about , which becomes the film's major fault . if you want something that is predictable about this unpredictable film , you have it here , you can bet your popcorn money that before the film is over some innocent kid will get it . if you want to read some politics into this film , you might say that the director was using the local american navy base as a metaphor , showing the mixed-reaction it gets from the locals , as he tried to get at what the local reactions to the base are by showing that there is an undercurrent of disrespect and lack of trust for each other . the mystery about them , gives them a camus-like sense of existentialism , it is as if the more modern the story tries to be , the more it can be seen rooted in an old philosophy , a philosophy of fatalism . the beauty in the film is from the never stopping camerawork , picking up one beautiful scene after another , though what connection this all has to do with the movie is anyone's guess . as i thought this film was about loners versus the group psychology prevailing , whereas the loners can't function with any kind of social measure because their troubling souls can find no place in modern french society to fit in . the trouble with that pat explanation of the film , is that the film doesn't help itself any by overloading the imagery , so that if one wanted to , there could by many other explanations for what the film was about . after a certain point , that becomes an annoying feature of the film , as the two teens lose their humanity and seem to be only symbols for what the director was trying to say . this is possible because of there persistent silence and lack of character development . aside from being a stunning film to watch , i could see no beauty in its dark character portrayal of the lovers and the film's overall pessimistic attitudes toward youth . the film had too many missing ingredients in it for it to be impactful ; i could hardly remember the main characters just a week later after seeing the film , only remembering how alluring vahina giocante was and how beautiful the south of france looks . "
427,"the problem with the film , as an original and diverting story as it is , is that it is also too confusing to follow and suffers from a sense that it is too "" hip "" for its own good . but even as the film failed to add up to being as good as it could have been , it was still entertaining and visually engaging . i began to enjoy the film more for its style , which is the only way to view it . it was shot in such exacting detail , its colorful sets becoming a feast for the eyes that were ready to experience visions not seen in other sci-fi films , it also allowed for a certain pleasure to be induced from overhearing the odd conversations that were inane but fun to listen to . fox's haiku is a good example of the meaningful nonsense the film conveyed , as he recites to x the poem he just wrote : but something mysterious soon happens and the last 20 minutes of the film repeats what happened so far , but adding new details and a different way of looking at it . the murky ending will not be pleasing to most viewers , as they try to make sense of what is happening . "
428,"its pulse is taken out of the shock stories that appear daily in the newspapers . sitko's classical noir line to him is , "" you going legitimate is like a vulture turning vegetarian . "" the once typical crime story from hollywood has now taken a more forlorn look at how people really are . fake niceties are not allowed in this highly charged atmospheric b&w film . sitko has no vices such as the bottle , womanizing , and gambling . he's about as clean-cut as a noir protagonist gets in these sort of films . the only thing that keeps him noir , is his cynicism and willingness to do anything to get what he wants . the ones who imbue the film with its usual noir credentials are the heavies : burr , whose only thought about being involved with murder was , "" i should have stuck to blackmail and petty larceny . "" "
429,"these scenes between the cops and the hysterical youth are classic noir ones and are what give the film its very dark edge . this was a dark tale and could have been made more interesting if it cut away from father roth's saintly but unconvincing role and followed through more on the story as it was written by philip yordan from leo brady's novel . the potential was there for a great film . censorship was the curse of the 1950s for films , and this good priest-bad priest part of the story unfortunately turns out to be an exercise in self-righteousness , unwisely tacked onto a perfectly good story . "
430,"warner bros . could crank-out smashing suspense films like this one on a regular basis during the 1940s . the film was faithfully adapted from the novel of british author , eric ambler , and had more of a european feel to it than the ordinary american noir , though because of the dark lighting and the shadowy photography of renown film cinematographer arthur edeson- he also did "" the maltese falcon , "" the film was able to retain its noir credentials despite lacking the usual cynicism of noir . the film uses flashback to tell the story . when peters gets the money , he is gleeful for the moment , as the money is photographed as looking huge onscreen , looking more like monopoly money than real . he adds as the film dissolves : "" you see , there's not enough kindness in the world . "" rich flavor in the film comes from the lead character actors , who are indescribably witty and tacky , displaying good chemistry in working with each other , whose characterizations are most striking . they , along with the strong performance by scott , give this pleasant thriller the life it needs to sustain it . the story itself , is too superficial to be anything more than a b type of programmer . but the film had a certain style to it that more than made up for the awkward telling of the story's ending . "
431,"a minor noir film , originally made for radio . vince tells him i grew up with you , we took a lot of raps together , and then you turned stool pigeon on me , turning state evidence on me so that you could beat the rap , making me serve a two year sentence for manslaughter . "" i should call dr . kemble ! "" but kemble is not available . the film's finale is done in grand noir-style , filmed in a santa monica warehouse , where one of vince's flunkies , petey , played by the rotund , minuscule veteran character actor with the high-pitched squeaky voice , percy helton , my all-time favorite bit player , who must have had thousands of uncredited parts in a variety of films . what distinguishes this film as not the normal crime-type of film , with a happy ending , but as a noir-work , is how it captures the changing societal attititudes of the protagonists , who desperately want to fit into postwar american society despite their prior misdeeds . this is seen mainly through the dark los angeles settings depicted by the camerawork of probably the best noir cinematographer ever , john alton , and not through the thin plot structure of the film . what leaves a lasting impression on the viewer , is the warehouse shootout , as we see these antisocial types trapped like rats and how they react . it all seems credible because john payne has the look of someone who has just come out of a laundry washing machine and is now being hung out to dry . "
432,"a vulgar mockumentary about a jewish-italian wedding , whose detractions are that some of the scenes could have been better edited , the jokes being rather lame , and the script being too threadbare . everyone in the film is a zany , as each character does their own comedy schtick . there is profanity used throughout the film and at the most surprising times , like when the groom's father ( vella ) is giving a toast . he says italians have little self-control when it comes to women , so he doesn't expect his son to remain loyal , even though he should because lisa's a nice girl . the film opens with a quote by h . l . mencken : "" marriage is a worthwhile institution , but would you want to live the rest of your life in an institution ! "" at least , one ethnic group is not treated any worse than the other . lisa has a great smile and a star quality about her , she brings comedy and warmth to the role ; she even gets a chance to sing . the cast was likable but not memorable , but for a film with a limited budget and limited aims , it served its purpose adequately . it was funny from beginning to end , but in a perverse way . this lighthearted farce , is not suited for all tastes . "
433,"jacques demy , the subject of this biography , was a great filmmaker ; his films were poetical visions , filled with music and fantasy and magic . the french director was most acclaimed for his inventive 1964 musical "" the umbrellas of cherbourg . "" the pivotal point of the film revolves around his use of imagination and how he was always inspired by it . vargas , by showing the "" inspirational "" episode from his childhood and then his usage of it in films such as , "" lola , "" "" the umbrellas of cherbourg , "" "" the young girls of rochefort , "" "" donkey skin , "" or some other demy work , has managed to tie the director's early life into his life in films . scenes like that come off as being truly genuine . but for all the niceties about him shown , and deservedly so , this biography seemed somewhat sterile and unwilling to question a lot of personal things about demy's life . it seemed to be bent on being an homage and final goodbye , without the benefit of being anything more critical . the film seems as if it was a guided museum tour given to elementary school children , that will only show the director's dedication to being a filmmaker and will reveal nothing about what is inside the man . this film should inspire others to follow their own beliefs , but does not have the magical qualities of a demy film . "
434,"is presented onscreen is an intelligent but somber look at how the three main characters cope with their uneven lives and manage to act so civilized when feeling so much pain at finding their lives to be unresolved . the film is a constant flux between flashbacks and what is current . we first see bendrix at his typewriter , writing about hatred . he plays the role romantically , in an old-fashioned manner , exhibiting a relish for the role . julianne moore evoked a special passion to her role , she was able to mix the fire in her with the serenity , making her performance a sublime one . the film works mainly because of her . that is why it was essential to film so many of their scenes over again , to witness how each viewed the same experience they were having . the problem with that , is the film seemed to move at a snail's pace , and had too much of a vacuum between its intellectual messages and heavily passionate scenes . overall , it was a rather dull film , despite the fine performances , the intelligence of the story , the able direction , and the beautiful cinematography . though what's astonishing about jordan's direction , is the mood the film sets , being so nostalgic and intimidating , as if daring the viewer to believe that this old-fashioned kind of genteel love story could also be so daring in its passions , and challenging in its arguments about jealousy , carnal love , and religious faith . this is all aided by the splendidly vivid images and the expressive language of the sensitive lovers trying to express their inner feelings . it is through greene's own words , where he relates how much more difficult it is to talk and write about happiness than it is about pain , that one can understand how the moore role is most likely to be believed only by a true believer , that words are inadequate to relate the joy she felt . the film , as well-conceived as it was , was still too laborious of a process . i think the story would have had more tension to it , if henry wasn't such a wimp and put up some kind of fight for his wife . "
435,"this is more of a message film than a noir thriller , but has been classified by most cinefiles in the noir category . brooks's novel broached the subject of a civilian getting killed by a soldier because he was a homosexual , but the breen office that acted as a censor for hollywood , would never allow that topic . so the filmmakers made the bias crime to be against a jew , which also was a subject hollywood tried to avoid , but , perhaps , because of the holocaust , it was allowed to be presented onscreen by the censor . coincidentally , in the same year , another film on the same subject , "" gentleman's agreement , "" appeared , which confined the anti-semitism to social situations . this b film , considered an experimental film , was budgeted for five hundred thousand dollars and shot in 20 days , and spent most of its budget on its star cast , and was rewarded with a box office success and a critically acclaimed hit . he had read brooks' novel and liked the book so much that he asked brooks , also a marine , to keep him in mind for the part of monty if the book ever gets made into a movie . the racial slur jewboy is used by monty , which emphasises how this is solely a hate crime . crossfire becomes more of a film about anti-semitism than it does a murder investigation , especially since there is no real mystery as to who did the killing . the script was stale , the acting was wooden by everyone but ryan . there isn't one character that doesn't speak in cliches except for ryan , and not a one has any individual depth . his original role was censored by the breen office . they felt it wouldn't look good to see soldiers frequenting a prostitute . what this film should be commended for , is that it brought to the public's attention that anti-semitism can also be the subject of a film . hollywood films have a history of staying away from controversial subjects and this b film did what other films didn't at the time . it is further interesting to observe , how this film got the ire of senator mccarthy and his witch hunters . under pressure from the censors , the filmmakers weren't allowed to explore any further the depths of anti-semitism . it should , also , be noted that both dmytryk and paxton received oscar nominations . the censors demanded that it is not in the best interest of the war department to show the soldiers drinking anything but coffee . even though the filmmakers were forced by the breen office to bend over backwards to make their film a safe one , it still was able to show the bias present in america and how serious a problem it was . it would have been a much better film if it weren't for the censor : there is absolutely no question about that . "
436,"the film is not a touristy tale ; it is based on irish folklore . the main problem it has , is that the story gets bogged down on unnecessary subplots , which make it difficult to focus entirely on the main story . rea is equally as good , in a role that is a take-off on the frenetic crazie eddie character who years ago was seen hawking goods on american tv . the landscape reflected the hard life of its denizens . a very scornful look at what some will do to get what they want or think they want . it is worth seeing for the tremendous performances and a bit of the gritty local flavor not usually seen about a film emanating from ireland . "
437,"in the end , it becomes indulgent and ties things up much too neatly to be taken seriously as drama . it is a familiar story , but told with great charm here and with sharp observations of how these academia types talk to each other and interact . the theme of "" wonder boys "" -- is conventional -- it is about the author's self-development . the script is snappy , the actors are pleasing to behold , the photography , mostly shots of pittsburgh in the midst of snow or a torrential downpour , is bleak-- but it interestingly sets the tone for the film's playful story . the idea for the film was a good one , but something gets stuck here , preventing the film from taking a chance and becoming a bold story , one that it could have easily become if it made that choice and knew what to edit and what to add . also dragged into the story are an interracial couple who add some slapstick scenes , enlarging the quirky flavor of the film . those scenes were amusing in the way those old-fashioned comedies of the 1930s and 1940s were . the film had a warm and fuzzy feeling to it . it had some good bob dylan tunes in the background . it was a return to liberalism movie , bucking a trend of a lot of new films to be more conservative or more extreme in their unconventionality . in any case , it was good to see a film about some older people with a sense of humor , a bit of romance in them , who are able to loosen up a bit . this does not make it a great film , but it was diverting and had a certain sophistication to it that should attract an older audience , one more perceptive about the advantages of a higher education . to the film's credit , it keeps its focus on tripp as someone who is mixed-up , but who is still trying to be a decent teacher and help those under his tutelage . "
438,"this irish crime charmer has 'the gift of gab . ' it's a shaggy-dog type of story , filled with colorful characters and the color of the irish countryside . the film should be valued for its amusing dialogue , despite the difficulty to understand what is being said because of the thick brogues . maybe , he's just a good guy , or a bit naive , or perhaps he is a bit short on smarts . it is mostly a road movie , showing what it's like to bring frank back to dublin . there are a lot of sudden twists in the story that keep you guessing as to what happens next . the violent conclusion is done with style and adds to the comic mood the film set . it is a rather cheerful film-- despite the violence , the lowlife characters , and all the peat bogs the duo come across . it also has something to say about being loyal as opposed to being greedy . its ethics are blurred by what society considers right and wrong , but by going over that line of decency , the film gains most of its charm . "
439,"the film has its rewarding moments to counter its muddled attempt to cover what actually happened . but spike is not that concerned with the serial killer , his perspective of the event is how it influenced an italian bronx neighborhood , bringing out its paranoia . the most interesting character in the film is not david berkowitz , but vinny ( leguizamo ) from the bronx , a hairdresser , someone of a working-class mentality and someone who is possessed with a weak character . it was at times a film that bordered on greatness , but then for long stretches turned back into a mess , filled with untenable stereotypes of the italians , while losing track of its story about the psycho . . 44-caliber michael badalucco's characterization added nothing to the story except disappointment that his character wasn't even attempted to be explored . it's a messy film , moving in many different directions , but it is filled with ideas and is always engaging . the lead performers leguizamo , brody , esposito , sorvino , and rispoli give crisp performances . leguizamo's performance is special in a visceral way , it exposes his double-standard life and his lowlife mindset , his rage is what the film keys in on . the film doesn't really come to a climax or say anything new about society at large , but it has an excitement of its own that is grandiose . that's about as complimentary as i can get about a film that should be praised more than it should be lambasted for its faults . it should be praised for showing how scared people are of those who are different and how they need to blame someone for what they don't understand . the scene near the end of the film was particularly violent and revolting , giving the film the jolt it needed to make its case about those who are narrow minded . this was not a film , after all , about the killer , its victims , or about the summer of 1977 , it was a film about those who were victimized because they are made into scapegoats for someone else's problems that they can't face themselves . it is a film about urban white people of italian origin : their fears , their angers , their prejudices , their repressions , and their eroticisms . it almost seems as if the story about the son of sam was not even needed . this was a film almost exclusively about an italian neighborhood and their xenophobia , and it could have taking place in any year after 1950 . "
440,"the charles dickens influence is evident on griffith's work , as the complications to this simple plot keeps getting more involved in the political trials of the revolutionary times . it also gave the director a chance to pontificate against the more current bolshevic revolution of 1917 . the popularity of the play inspired at least one french and three american film adaptations . it's not a film without major faults , which include stilted acting , clumsy characterizations , an implausible tale , and laughable melodrama . but somehow the well-intentioned sincerity of the story plows its way through the mess and the film is interesting as both a museum curio and for the raw emotions expressed by the suffering sisters . it is also noted for its rough characterization of robespierre , its beautiful costumes and authentic looking mob scenes , capturing the chaos of the times . but it still should prove to be of interest mainly to film buffs rather than the general public . he was someone who believed that if you didn't think like him , you were evil . the excessively melodramatic story is one that tugs at the heart strings , but makes up for so much goo by conveying griffith's history lesson : that the french revolutionists rightly overthrew a bad government , but unfortunately allowed dictatorial mob rule to take over . how the film works for you , depends on what you can overlook about it that is creaky and what you can accept about it that is grandiose . it has not aged well , but i found it worth seeing for its historical value and its chilling suspense . for whatever the director's faults were , as for his politics being tainted with contradictions , he , at least , always considered his art above all else . it is filmed in a pleasant to look at tinted b/w . "
441,"so begins this gothic mystery , based on umberto eco's witty novel . for the monks , without fear there would be no reason to believe in god . the story is chaotically told , making it difficult to keep track of what exactly is happening . if only the telling of the story wasn't such a clumsy venture and the identity of the killer so easy to solve , this could have been a more enjoyable film . sean connery is charismatic and though an odd choice to play the lead , if you can suspend your disbelief in him as a book lover to the extreme , and see him more like a modern sleuth , then his characterization seems to be a humorous one . though , i still think this part would have been better served by someone who was a bit more quirky . he reminded me too much of his james bond persona , which was a definite clash with the medieval scenario he was placed in . but the weakness inherent in the film , is in the dullness of the characters ( looks aside ) and the story itself is bereft of the wit the author gave it in its printed word . when the powerful apocalyptic finale comes and the monastery is in flames , it is too late to save the film . just like william saved only a few valuable books from the fire , the viewer can cherish only a few scenes that were irresistible , and thereby may come away only somewhat satisfied .

442,"you get a film with a few subplots in it for the ticket price of one here . but you ultimately get what you pay for , and here the main story becomes tiring and the secondary story is oedipal and underplayed , and the other subplots are pointless , so what you really get is the main story being compromised by the subplots , which weakens the main story into a formula-driven one . the main story is a homage to the movie "" wall street "" and its message of greed but , at least , it comes without the moral piety of oliver stone . yet , he still stays with the firm , something the film couldn't really show why , even though they tried explaining it with a subplot of a ruptured father/son relationship . the story's other subplot is a frenetic tale of white men in their twenties with lots of testosterone to burn , who just want to be millionaires and don't care how they do it . the dialogue is schmaltzy and unconvincing ; their hard sell techniques are sleazy and leave the characters soulless , and the 'homeboy' attitudes displayed by their after-work hijinks- of pub crawling , looking for fights and girls , leaves a lot to be desired . father and son had a tension between them that made for some melodramatic moments . but this is clearly a film about young people with unbridled energy who are clueless about how to live their lives without copying someone else's idea of what the good life is . and because they are so dull-witted and deliver lines without the gift of gab that a writer like david mamet presents his stars with , in his glengarry glen ross , the film lags in scope . but through the device of quick-paced editing , it appears to be moving to some sort of rapid resolution . its moral theme might be , if you get rich so fast , you must be ready to fall quickly . the characters here are just low-level white collar hustlers , the amoral garden variety kind , and their distasteful conduct and empty lives spark no interest . these are the kind of telemarketers that the american public has been inundated with over the recent years , with no end in sight . since the film doesn't humanize them , but allows them to be the monsters they really are , it is indeed a hard sell to find this film as anything but a look at the ugly side of outlaw capitalism . the movie has a lot of energy and zeroes in on an unhealthy segment of the population whose lure for working is solely for material things , such as fancy cars , not giving a hoot how ethical their job is . its company name j . t . in the background hip-hop music blares away . this is a film geared for young people , its target audience is probably made up of those who liked last year's overrated nihilistic fight club . a romance is brought into the film as another subplot , but is never fully developed to be anything but superficial . she shuns greg and goes for his underling seth , in a romance that has about as much spark in it as a firecracker that fizzles out in your hand . why this interracial romance develops and how it suddenly ends , doesn't amount to hill or beans . the best thing about the film was the performance of vin diesel as chris , a seasoned hustler of stocks and bitter rival of greg's . there is a certain power in his character , a believability about what he is doing there that seemed more intense than seth's fall and redemption . the film would have been better off focusing in on his story ; it would have remained true to its cynical premise about the youth it features . this story is at best , about a theme that was done before in films such as "" wall street "" and "" tin men , "" but this time with even more cynicism and more of an edge to it . the picture itself is a hustle , trying to sell you something by pretending it has something to say , if you hold onto to its premise without selling it short . underneath the closeness of the boys in the boiler room , there are some underlying problems in their relationships besides the usual ones of competiveness . and chris shoots back , "" why don't you go make me a latke , dreidel boy ? "" interestingly enough , the only one in the firm that seth trusts is chris , and this trust is rewarded in a contrived scene in the end , as the film tries to dig itself out of the amoral hole it dug for itself . the operative word in this film is contrived . "
443,"it did ruin the film to a certain extent , as it looked disjointed in parts and did not appear up to fuller's usually high standards of filmmaking . nevertheless , it resulted in a disturbing film about american morality that has something to say about hypocrisy and something modern to say about being an independent woman . the couple talk about byron's poetry and about venice being a special place for lovers , and everything seems too good to be true . for towers , the naked kiss is that of a pervert . for fuller , this film is a morality story , where honesty can't seem to exist within the law but only outside of it . the weakness in the film , is that it asks you to believe its flighty story without questioning it . but its moral premise is on solid footing . "
444,"i think i've seen this film before : it's called pulp fiction . but that aside , this is a very funny crime caper , involving double-crosses , kidnappings , and outrageous shootouts . it is stylized noir-- meaning noir is no more to be taken seriously as in the post-ww11 noir films . it is now used by many directors as a spoof of the genre , as it is here , by the first-time woman director , jennifer leitzes . the film relies on its characters to make things happen , as the story really is too slight to do the complete job , of making montana bigger than the small state of mind it is . it was scenes like this , coming in flashes , that kept the film alive . stanley tucci is a marvelous actor and is a joy to watch here . kyra sedgwick works well with tucci and significantly adds to the farcical nature of the film . philip seymour hoffman never gives a bad performance ; here he is the creepy turncoat , a part he can do in his sleep by now . but he does it well . the high level of acting raises this ordinary film in stature , but does not make it into anything more than a highly entertaining and derivative film . "
445,"raul ruiz , the chilean-born , france-based director of one hundred films so far , who has been noted for his offbeat features and ambiguous works , has made this american mainstream film in english that has all his pet themes intact . for a ruiz film , this one is about as accessible as he gets . if you ever wanted to know how it might feel for a person who is losing their marbles , this film might be able to shed some light on that . it is a tantalizing thriller that offers the viewer a chance to see if they can separate fantasy from reality . ruiz's films always seem to be about the multiple identities of characters who might just be figments of one's imagination or might be about someone who is leading a parallel life . shattered image has its two stars struggle through some very awkward dialogue and plot twists that keep coming unmercifully at the viewer . ruiz's experimental film style opts for the most he can get out of his stylized settings , confusing but beautiful camera shots , and all the kitsch he can muster in every mise-en-sc ? ne . but she can't determine what he looks like . the film's ending is as blurred as jessies' intermingled dreams are ; but , at least , the climax returns to the beginning of the film to try and clear things up in the usual unhelpful way ruiz solves his mysteries . if you enjoy this kind of pseudo intellectual puzzler , then you must be prepared to be kept in suspense , not knowing more about the character than what ruiz wanted revealed . "
446,"a feel-good , old-fashioned ( except for all the cuss words ) , liberal message movie for the people and by the people , resulting in a populist film . it surprised me in how invigorating a performance there was from julia roberts ( she usually turns me off ) , and how there was such a good chemistry between her and the gruff albert finney . but , the subtle performance by the rumpled looking finney , playing second fiddle without a hint of a complaint , as his panned reactions to her antics made her star quality shine more brightly , was the key to the film's success . his role is a paper-thin one , as the sensitive , long-suffering lover . it reminds me of the role hollywood usually reserves for the sweet but simple lady co-star , who is just around to make the star look good . julia roberts's breasts are propped up and very noticeable , wearing tight-fitting clothes with low necklines , at all times . when told by the boss "" you might want to rethink your wardrobe a little , "" she retorts , "" i think i look nice , and as long as i have one ass instead of two , i'll wear what i like . "" the film was all about her . it plays pompously proud of itself like the do-gooder fare it is , with no real emotions shown for the victims , as it only shows the pain julia feels for them . this one's all about julia roberts , and if you buy into her for the part , you are more than likely to be pleased with the film . as for my reaction , i felt , what the hell , the utility company acted so maliciously evil and the outcome of the case is documented , so what i would not have accepted so readily from a drama , i found myself accepting in this political conscience film . where i saw the film , the same type of working-class clients of julia's , were in the audience and were laughing lustily at the jokes , and they seemed to enjoy seeing this big company being taking on by one of them . this mainstream film by steven soderbergh ( sex , lies and videotape/out of sight/the limey ) , is shot in a sitcom conventional style , without most of the director's usual artististic flourishes from his past films . there have been many hollywood films of this type , including , silkwood , a civil action , and norma rae , with this film somewhere in the middle of the entertainment scale when held in comparison . "
447,"when don pedro agrees , serafin tells the audience that i am macoco . there are several surprises in the works and an outstanding dance number by the nicholas brothers . this highly entertaining film overcomes its stagy plot with some lively cole porter tunes , gorgeous costumes and scenery design , and a lot of energy from the talented cast . all told , this an enjoyable and lighthearted work , one of the director's minor works . "
448,"a stylishly slick , romantic thriller , that is pleasing to the senses in a brainless manner . you have to remember that this film was made in the radicalized 1960s and that reason for robbing a bank might have been accepted back then in some circles of thinking . there's a closing scene with a twist of betrayal that was much influenced by the style of french new wave films . but the film will not be remembered for its plot or the twists in it , but only for the good chemistry in it between the cary grant-like suave demeanor of mcqueen and the the cool disposition of the good looking dunaway . though the sex scenes were not very fleshy , it was mostly foreplay via dialogue , the film , nevertheless , still sold itself on this game of sex between the two amoral fortune hunters . the film also offered an oscar winning song scored by michael legrand , windmills of your mind , and some fancy camera work of split-screen images by cinematographer haskell wexler . but if you are looking for anything but a fun film , i think you'll be disappointed . it turns out to be an easily forgettable caper movie that was pleasing on the eyes as much as easy on the noodle .

449,"dennis schwartz : "" ozus' world movie reviews "" "
450,"the director is clearly more concerned with artful flourishes , elizabeth's lustfulness , and the modern ways to look upon a queen trying to be a ruler of men , rather than exploring further the tragic and specific drama of the times . this one's primarily a costume piece melodrama that enjoyably emphasizes the conspiracies surrounding the so-called virgin queen , who is destined to rule england's golden age for some 40 years . it was a scene that seemed out of place when compared to the rest of the film , even though it was a striking and memorable scene . elizabeth is a film with a propensity for depicting spacious castles that have dark interiors and characters who have dark intentions . elizabeth creates a panoramic view of 16th century england and its intrigues . it is a film that does a better job making elizabeth a vivid characterization , than it does of providing unforgettable dialogue and good storytelling . cate blanchett becomes elizabeth , giving her a modern feminist voice and a dark look inside her soul , in a daring performance that works out rather well , considering the film was emotionally flat and uninvolving . "
451,"a real-life chilling tale of matricide is put forth in a complex build-up of an obsessive and passionate relationship between two very imaginative adolescent girls , set in christchurch , new zealand , between 1953 and 1954 . the 33-year-old director , new zealander peter jackson ( braindead/dead alive ) , previously known for making gore films , has come up with a stunning melodramatic story , spoiled only by the director's excessive camera shots of the girls' fantasy world , which was more arty than enlightening . pauline is shy but bright , heavy-set and plain looking , from a working-class and uneducated family , with a scarred leg from a few operations due to weak bone structure ; while , juliet is pretty and slender , worldly , aggressively sure of herself , from an upper-class , well-educated family , but is suffering from tuberculosis . by tossing fantasy and reality together in such a haphazard manner , it creates a world of disturbing visions , one in which the film holds the viewer's interest throughout . it feels like we can't quite grasp what is on the girls' minds , even if we are privileged to hear pauline's troubling voiceover , explaining her diary notations , even if we are caught by the exilaratingly romantic moods of the girls and their imaginative games they play . the acting by winslet and lynskey is superb . the film is also visually stunning , but the moral of the story is never made clear and there is bit too much pretentious fantasy art thrown into the script . "
452,"he becomes the source of parody , as the doctors piece him back together , whereby he can't talk clearly , looks grotesque , and has holes in his throat so that when he smokes , the smoke can be seen coming out of his throat . the prison scenes were over-the-top , trashy , and fun to watch , as the director did not care a damn about drama or plot . the film shoots for tongue-in-cheek humor in the interactions between characters and also it aims to cast some black humor on the social hypocrisies of the welfare , judicial , and penal systems . as satire , this film is tops . it was excessive , but it had enough bite in it to do some damage . reese witherspoon's performance was contagious , watching her cut-up , act-tough , be vulnerable , and drop comic lines with a natural ease , and all the time , the film had the feel of being noir , even though it was really satire . it had enough toughness in it to be viewed as a thought provoking film , when the action cleared and the cartoonish-type of laughs emanating from the veggie-like characters died down . the film had a lot of little things going for it , that added up to big plusses . the film's opening credits had the grimm fairy tale story of little red riding hood depicted in its cartoon drawings . freeway has the look of a crazed fable , as bulky onscreen figures are made to look less imposing at each impending scene and the vulnerable ones either die or get stronger just by surviving amidst such violent chaos . the film draws to its inevitable conclusion- of blood and gore , despair and muted hope , and the irrelevancy of the 1990s in trendy california , which can be seen as a failed center-piece for social change . the film's sordid family scenario , leaves its sensationalized news stories mockingly imprinted on the airwaves , depicting how sad life is and how cartoon-like are the players , left to their own vanities , frolicking in an artificial landscape of alienation and violent gestures . "
453,"following on the heels of "" the exorcist "" , "" the omen "" is another box-office success , one of many commercial horror thrillers spawned in the 1970s , and much better critically than most others . it is even a more satisfying film than the exorcist . what makes this film so captivating , is how it relies on narrative and not special effects to build on tension . this adorable cherub turns out to be none other than the antichrist . or maybe , by taking the bible literally , that can become a problem . how this film gets to hold its head higher than most of the other films of this nature , is because the acting is first-class , the telling of the story is tight , and the criss-crossing between london , rome , and jerusalem , is suspenseful . the film is in constant motion , so it is made difficult to stop and think , and reflect how much hokum there is in the story . so , i can't really blame the very prudish and politically sensible thorn for not believing the priest . this gets thorn's attention , at last . all this leaves the ambassador befuddled , looking only as gregory peck can look , when things that are supposed to make sense don't . while in jerusalem , there are a few more shocks , and the story excitedly swings back to london . here , a few more shocks develop . the film succeeds because it knows how to tell a suspenseful story and not rely on green vomit for its shocks , like the exorcist resorted to , as the omen manages to have its shocks look sensible and seem convincing . "
454,"a verbose talk-fest , which is a play more than a visual film experience , as adapted by sidney lumet from ira levin's broadway play about a parlor murder game . lumet as always , sucks any subtlety out of his films . here he is in a bit of a frenzy in portraying the characters , relying more on plot twists than character development . in comparison with a similar-type of stage play put to the silver screen , joseph l . mankiewicz's sleuth , lumet's is clearly the inferior one . at this point , the film had a fluidity and a macabre comical tone to it . but , it changes in a drastically different direction , and the surprises in the plot , from here on , come about faster than a venice beach skateboarder trying to impress the bystanders . what eventually shines through , is how clever and manipulative the script is . i felt used by the characterizations , as it took away a lot of the pleasure derived from the snappy dialogue and the absurdity of the storyline , that in the first act , worked really well . caine seemed marvelous at first , but i soon tired of his constantly frantic look . it was dyan cannon , with her sweet giggles and frustrated looks , who brought a needed restraint to the film , and as long as she was onscreen the film had an edge to it . too many contrivances made everything seem so superficial , which is a shame , because the film did have its funny moments . "
455,"this is a coming-of-age film , that plays as bittersweet melodramatics . it's a pleasant little film , with its small aims hitting its target repeatedly , quietly reflecting the joys and sorrows the youngster must go through in order to grow up , and how the bland 1950s and its omens of the future in space travel , new pop-up toasters , and a tv in every house , influence the youngster's life . by being very easy to talk to , with no pretenses , he thereby develops a warm and natural relationship with the youngster and makes his summer experience a joyous one . the film is charming , it is sad , it is true-to-life , and never maudlin or sugary . it's a good nostalgia film for all those yearning to look back at their childhood , even if it be only vicariously through ingemar . i fell for the film without being swept off my feet by it . the message underlying ingemar's experience , is that life holds so much suffering in it , that one might as well get a few laughs out of it while one can . the scenes of the snow on the tv screen while all the neighbors are brought in to watch a movie , the radio broadcast of the swedish boxer ingemar johansson landing a lucky punch and knocking out the american champ floyd patterson , and the challenging games kids play to compete against each other , all brought back to me bittersweet memories of the 1950s . "
456,"it's an ambitious effort about how one can preserve one's dignity in the face of poverty . the picture tries to cover much territory , in this long epic-like , period-piece production of over two hours . it seems like a mess , as the film has too many stories going all at once and too many characters coming in and out of it to follow them all , and the acting is less than compelling . as a result , it is easy to lose track of the real-life figures for the cardboard symbols they represent , as the sides are drawn up -- the good guys are the struggling actors-and-the bad guys the industrial magnates . but , fortunately , the film rises to the occasion in its uplifting finale , bringing a renewed energy for its clear-cut message to be credibly received , at last . this is an old-fashioned liberal film , preaching its humanitarian message to the choir . the unfortunate thing about the film , is that it is not terribly entertaining . the film lumbered through by showing snippets of the theater rehearsals , introducing and then forgetting about a cast the size of an army . john adair ( sheridan ) is one of the actors who pushes her on-stage to get the part and he becomes her boyfriend , in a story that left me feeling unmoved , as it was just typical hollywood goo , seen many times before . the real-life characters from the theater group harldy fare better when portrayed : the bland marc blitzstein ( hank azaria ) , who says he is not a communist but a homosexual ( but the point being made is that homosexuals are viewed just as badly as the commies are ) . they both gave forgettable performances . there are intertwined stories around the theater about the industrialists mixing with the fascists . these scenes could have been even more potently dramatic , if the miscast cusack was replaced by someone who could do a better rockefeller . at one point nelson says , "" i must confess that i'm more interested in the oil in paint than the oil in derricks . "" you've got to find a way to give them a dollar -- and take two ! "" vanessa redgrave , in a stereotyped role , is gray's lightheaded , titled wife , countess la grange , with liberal aspirations and sympathy for the theater people . all these parts seem oversimplified , with the director pulling the strings as if the actors were puppets , and though the message is right-on , there was no immediacy or impact in the story . there was no art in the art , everything moved along predictably . i imagine that someone with much more political savvy and more experience directing than robbins , like mike leigh , could have found a way to get around this mess without altering where the sympathies should lie to pull off a more satisfying work . the cast and the audience then trekked uptown through the streets and saw the show there . there was no scenery , there was just blitzstein at the piano , and the play made history with a most thrilling and memorable opening . but , ultimately , politics aside , the trouble with the original play became what was the trouble with this movie version , the story and the music are just too dry , though the message it presents , is worth savoring . but , any film that can quote nelson rockefeller and also leave no mistake where those other industrial patrons of the arts stood , makes me recommend this well-intentioned but flat dramatic film solely on that basis . ah ! "
457,"it's rare that a woman directs a noir film and especially one as hard-boiled as this one appears to be . the theme of the film could easily be : 'misery loves company . ' ms . greenwald's penchant for long close-ups of her disgruntled players , creates a noir feel for the film . she also adds strength to the noir style of the film , by having the dialogue stripped to the bare minimum . the film's downbeat mood reflects the characters and their dismal lives . she lacks the confidence to believe that she will be able to do a good job as a stripper . ms . greenwald , instead , lets the viewer see who killed luanne . the film failed to be a nail-biter and it wasn't psychologically deep , nor was it morally arresting , but what it had going for it in spades , was showing a feeling of malaise . a very competently made film , if you are willing to be taken down such dark stairs , where the light is very dim and the view is not that great and what becomes rewarding , is seeing how transfixed the characters are as they cannot change their ways , even if they come to realize that their life depends on positive changes occurring .

459,"here's one spectactle of a film ridley scott definetly made for the masses , a large-budgeted ( somewhere over 100 million bucks ) digital effects epic , a star wars film for grown-ups , with the intention to overwhelm you with its technical feats and please your senses with its photography and dazzle you with the roman colosseum gladiator events , and most of all , it tries to breathe new life into the much maligned and parodied heroic tale . art becomes subservient to the public's taste for what is deemed enjoyable . the film keeps reminding you in intervals of every 15-minutes , as if that was a spot to go for a commercial , that its aim is primarily to please the crowd . with a functional script to its credit , some fine bursts of mannered acting by russell crowe who is asked to carry the film and ably manages to ground it on his furtive looks of steel and his intense inner need for revenge , and the film's palatable heroic story of good versus evil , the film is a reminder of the old hollywood sword- and- sandal films of grandeur and muscle and frivilousness . though , it lacks the kind of political intrigue to be considered in the same class with kubrick's last fling with hollywood , spartacus . in modern times , it comes closest to aping braveheart . general maximus commands his troops to `unleash hell' on their underdog adversaries with an outpouring of arrows and flaming canisters to fill the screen with blood and gore and mud , and a beautifully framed picture of the barbarians' woods on fire and its landscape turned into an eerie hue of bluish-gray ash . scott succeeds in his visceral opening just like spielberg did in saving private ryan , of grabbing the audience's attention and keeping it for most of the film . he snarls and says things in a low but sure-fired baritone voice , that is heavily-laced with a macho australian accent "" in this life or the next , i will have my vengeance . "" the film is gaudy but it is entertaining , always a pleasure to look at even if it is disdainful to think what crass aims it is up to . oliver reed did a feisty job and stole a few scenes toward the end of the film with his cynical performance . russell crowe relished the fight scenes and gave the film exactly what it asked for . connie nielsen added some class to the storytelling . the film did match the uneven quality of the old hollywood film , the kind of standard epic that hasn't been made for a number of years , and probably won't be made after this one because of the prohibitive high budget . if you notice , sex is all but absent from the film , there is instead , plenty of violence . ah ! people's tastes are so fickle !

461,"a noble idea for a film to satire some of the best known american pop culture heroes of the 1950s , as directed by the britisher nicolas roeg , from a terry johnson play conceived in 1982 . the film often misses the target , but since it throws everything into the mix , it sometimes is delightfully on target , providing both amusement and thought-provoking reactions . the fictionalized encounters , which try to capture the essence of the pop culture characters rather than depicting them as real-life characters , though using what knowledge the public has of them , the characterizations seem pretty close to the truth . what really makes this film work , are the excellent performances by the stars . marilyn is the life of the film , presenting a sexy and engaging sex goddess , who is both vulnerable and pushy . einstein is upset by that , mentioning that knowledge isn't something that is true-- it's just an agreement made by people that makes it seem true . the film is a bit of a mess , with no certain plot and it seems to have no particular aim it hopes to accomplish . but as a diverting look at these fantasies of the four 1950 icons , it makes for provocative theater and in the process , it sometimes offers us some inspired thoughts to think about . it sort of sucks you along for its ride and you don't mind going along because its kind of fun to imagine how those characters really were . the film's efforts might be comparable to a guy fantasizing how it would be to sleep with marilyn monroe .

462,"the league of gentlemen is a fine example of old-fashioned english humor : droll and civil . the film's strong suit is watching the precision planning that goes into the operation as it unfolds and how all these older blokes exhibit their odd personalties to mesh into a team-operation replete with proper military decorum . a very watchable caper movie , but with a decided british edge to it which might inhibit some american viewers from enjoying it as much . the lovable rogue characters give the film a spirited uplift , with hawkins , patrick , livesey , and attenborough being particularly good in their portrayals . what the film lacks is any kind of intensity , it's all comedy and manners .

463,"this most uncompromising film is based on the britisher j . g . but what this canadian film is trying to say about those subjects , is anyone's guess . my guess , after seeing this film three times , is that it is not trying to say anything that is revelational , but it takes a car crash -- something no one in their right mind can revel in and think they are sexually getting off on -- and depicts a sexual fetish cult that finds a car crash to be as stimulating as a sexual act . it is a film probing how strange the mind is , especially in this post-nuclear age ; and , how sex is created in the mind , and how sexual fetishes are no stranger than anything else conceived there . in lieu , of a regular storyline , the film consists of a series of obsessive scenes regarding car crashes and of having sex in a car . it is the kind of film that one will either love or hate . one thing can be said with a certain amount of reassurance , the film is a faithful adaptation of the book , even keeping the monotonous mood of the book's repetetive themes played out over and over again . at the 1996 cannes film festival , where it got mixed reviews of boos and cheers from the crowd , it nevertheless received a special jury prize for "" originality . "" the film has something to say that comes in the form of a veiled warning about the future of technology and the potential deepening psychopathology that is needed for a more benevolent humanity . it has caused ripples of controversy , not because of any theme it might have , but because of the sex scenes in the cars , its crossing of old moral boundaries in favor of pornography , and the way the film unfolds without a visible story . its naysayers said , it would encourage viewers to have sex while driving in their car , thereby causing accidents . all i could say to those arguments -- is horsefeathers ! if that's a legitimate reason to ban or knock a film , you might as well censor almost every film made as presenting some danger or another . one evening , james , helen , and catherine attend , what can only be described as a show that has an unusual theme , even for performance theater . hey , i've got no problems with them so far , but it seems more funny than it is serious . . . though there is something intangible about the emptiness of this film and its unwillingness to deliver any expected messages or cater to the masses demand to be entertained , that makes this film intriguing in a very special way . if the film disturbed or was meant to disturb , i can't really say that it disturbed me . it's a speculative work , like a test project , trying to see what it can come up with that works . that there is such a thing as someone having a car crash sex fetish like those in the film , seems unlikely . but that doesn't seem to matter . what matters is that this film is looking for something to say about the modern world and the new kind of strangeness it has developed . that everyone is dehumanized in this film , might be the point of it . the acting , for what the actors were asked to do-- that is , all act in an emotionless fashion except for the bizarre portrayal by koteas , is accomplished rather successfully . hunter is like them- dehumanized to a certain point , she seems to be interested in her own sexual self-satisfaction above anything else , and her near-death experience seems to have reinforced that need . for me , the story might be perceived as being more voyeuristic than controversial . it defies having a label attached to it . somehow , it drew me into its audacious storytelling . i am not annoyed to be put in the position of being a voyeur , as much as i am amazed by how all the cultists respond to their lives . the film itself is daring because it is different than other films , it covers ground where mainstream films dare not go ; its repetitiveness , its hermetic and absurd nature , make for a film that i like better than how it is perceived through all the hype it has received . i enjoyed it because it was so well-made and acted , and strangely enough , for a film that some criticized as pornographic , i found it to be in the best of taste . what it lacked was definition and perception , and a sense of getting out of its own awe-inspiring way . "
464,"this fictionalized film looks as if it could be a documentary , shot in the cinema verite style . this kid's a downer , with a low attention span and a naive recognition of how messed up he is . just live in the snow . first-time director julian goldberger got into the kid's head and presented a haunting portrayal of what it is like to be lost and frightened in a world that is too complex for this junk food eating kid , who looks like a psycho with his crew-cut but is as soft as a twinkie . what the film does best besides have their unlikely antihero be the appealing voice of the film , is catch the desolate mood of the locale . what it forgets to do , is tell a good story . that the prison system is not the answer for kid's like this , is also obvious . why he was in prison is not given , but there's hints that he was picked up as a sniffer of chemicals or some other minor offense . this kid is certainly not a hardened criminal , which is the shame of it all , as there seems to be no answers from society or from this film what to do about lost souls like him . at least , the film makes clear that its position is that incarceration is not the answer , which certainly goes against the current grain of thinking in america . despite the film's good look and the way it uses a novel approach in its film language to echo what ryan is thinking , everything seems surface deep . it could have used something else to compensate for the mindlessness of ryan to go along with his painful tale of hopelessness and the film's evocative atmosphere , which wears thin after awhile . "
465,"this film can be loosely pegged as a noir film , though it plays more like a typical 1950s caper movie . this minor slip-up , is why in a loose way , mike becomes a noir protagonist , though he doesn't have the dark side to his character this genre usually calls for . even the bank manager and the f . b . i . i think if the filmmaker reworked some of the loose ends left hanging in this film , there would have been a much stronger film to complement the very strong characterization of the earnest barry sullivan character the filmmaker was able to present . "
466,"it stridently shows in its futuristic prediction what the united states might become like if the reactionary right-wing had their way . it is a polemic exercise between the left and the right , with no room for the middle point of view . though the director tries to present some of the establishments' arguments against these young dissenters to show that he is impartial , the weight of what is going down is so heavy , that even when the tribunal members make a plausible response , it still sounds vacuous given the current situation . they mostly say things like the protesters don't care about this country , that the vietnam war is a "" just "" war because it is aimed to stop the spread of communism , and that the protesters are trying to make a mockery of the american way of life . that the politician is nothing but a debater . while the pacifists' say that war is only just when it is entered into without any hatred in one's heart . the honorable thing to do at a crisis time like this , is be a criminal -- that at another time it might be to become a politician . the film had a gritty look to it and should bring back some of the worst confrontational memories of a time the country was divided in a very hostile way . what was missing from the film , was a sense that it could accomplish anything . but , maybe , that wasn't possible , especially looking at this film some thirty years later and realizing how there was no way to justify the war and the racism at the time . to add to that the fictional suspension of individual rights and a horror chamber like punishment park , makes this film seem like a futile diatribe that lost its prospective of what its aim was . yet , if the film's polemics disturbs , but fails to entertain as a film , it still had some bite in it , and its non-professional cast made this an unusual film , one worth watching for all the intensity it displayed despite its inability to alter any one's mind from their current views . it is , simply , preaching to the choir . "
467,"this is an authentic "" dogma 95 "" film , as before the film opens , that assurance comes with a signed guaranteed shown on the screen that it was made according to the rules stipulated by the danish directors who founded this school of sparse filmmaking -- lars von trier and thomas vinterberg . the hand-held camera was obvious throughout the film as were the film's lack of special effects , supposedly giving the viewer a chance to discover on their own any beauty worth finding in the film , rather than to be hit over the head with it . like all dogmas , they eventually wear out whatever usefulness they might have had in the first place . soren kragh-jacobsen's "" mifune "" is dogma's third approved project , after vinterberg's "" celebration "" and von trier's "" idiots . "" it is the weakest of the three , but still , it has some punch in a conventional way due to the film's technical clarity . it is a playfully weird telling of a familiar romantic comedy situation , much like a hollywood formula film . it has a lot of dead spots where it tried comedy and a lot of predictability as far as its romantic situation , but it also had a certain intrinsic beauty about it that kept it afloat and made it seem better than its story was . it is , nevertheless , a surprisingly conventional work , which makes me wonder about all the fuss this dogma 95 group go through to give the impression that they are radical filmmakers . a rather trite choice of subject matter for a group that i would have thought to be more politically motivated . what worked well in this film , was that the actors had personality that flashed on the screen , and that there were some breathtaking nature shots of the golden sun going down and of the rich colors of the danish backwater fields . this film doesn't go against that observation . now i would have bet anyone in the theater and have given them 10-1 odds , that was the last of the marriage , that's how obvious this plot was . her smile is the pure one , while claire also smiles , but her's is a selfish one . this dogma 95 film left me unmoved , though its story was pleasant and well-crafted . it just felt too much like an art-house film designed to please its audience rather than to be provocative . "
468,"inspired by the 1994 novel by william trevor , this is a film about a serial killer that promised to be more inspiring than it turned out , even though it is an excellently crafted film and has more to offer than the usual serial killer film does . it , somehow , takes a familiar journey down this director's path even if it seems the director is drifting off into foreign territory . the innovative canadian of armenian descent , atom egoyan , who has in the past covered such familiar themes as he does here , revisits the themes of betrayal , familial ills , religious conflicts , sexual secrets , videotapes , and uncertain identities . bob hoskins performance is brilliantly mannered , even if he chews the scenery to gain such control , but , nevertheless , he is engaging as a manipulative predator and someone who could be both charming and frightening . what fails this otherwise competent and worthwhile production , is that everything falls too easily into psychological place by the film's end . we are led to believe we understand too much about this serial killer and that he can be redeemed , but the reality is , that we understand too little about him , despite the appropriate effort that is made to understand him . when the nature of the relationship hoskins has in mind with felicia becomes obvious , the film can't recover from this knowledge and it becomes more natural for the audience to care that the angelic cassidy somehow survives what is intended her , rather than the film going into deeper and more unfamiliar ground . this serial killer film falls below the achievements of m and peeping tom , as it falls into the range of films that miss their mark but are still enriching . "
469,"this is a winning madcap comedy , enhanced by the mercurial pairing of jackie chan with owen wilson , featuring a fluid script and some irrespressible comedy routines . though the plot of the film revisits familiar territory , of the rescue of the princess tale , and the idea of a buddy movie , where characters who are opposites must mesh together . but , what overcomes that familiarity , is the energy and chemistry the two co-stars have and their ability to look good on-the-screen together . what results are well-executed pratfalls , lots of sight gags , ingenuous fight scenes , some stupid ethnic jokes and the flaunting of indian stereotypes , but whereas those old westerns had the bias be for real , here's its in jest and , all the while , the film keeps the comedy rolling on . though not all the comedy works , the scenes of owen in the whorehouse were stale and offered the lowest kind of vulgarian humor . but there is something inexplicable about the stars that make this film effective and able to overcome its triteness . it was better than what i expected from a jackie chan hollywood film , and credit must be given to first-time director tom dey for making the film so appealing and so people friendly . it should prove well in the box office , probably reaching past its targeted teenage audience , and after all , this is a business film . . . whose "
470,"a sometimes funny parody and uncanny black comedy , about incest , sexual repression , and the jewish mob . but its failure to be consistently on focus with its characters' comings and goings , in what seems like a pointless amount of gore being displayed , acts to undermine the film's artful plot set-up . as the film is too often off target , bringing up too many subjects for it to handle , it just fires away , taking aim at everything in its way and missing just as often as it hits . the breaking of the nose gives rise to the saying , i could have beaten him six ways to sunday . there is no smooth sailing in this difficult story to behold , which might have something to do with love . if love is the message here , it is not the conventional kind , but it is one that is stranger and stronger than harry's repressions , hatred and violence . everytime one looks up on the screen , someone seems to be getting violently bumped off , yet harry manages to survive and will leave youngstown with iris by the film's end , which , oddly enough , after all the mayhem and absurdity of harry's insane life , the film turns out to have a temporarily happy ending . this might be the strangest thing about this film , for a film that has gone out of its way to be stranger than fiction or love . this film should appeal mostly to those who like offbeat stories and their comedy to be darker than black , and don't mind if confusion is the main ingredient that propels the story . i took it at face value to be black comedy and found myself laughing often , though the people i saw it with , thought it was over-the-top in blood and gore , and found little in it to like and found the film was far too self-indulgent to work as a love story for them . "
471,"small time crooks is a small time comedy , nourished by getting a fast start off the gate with some pretty familiar comedy routines -- it starts off paying homage to the italian film "" big deal on madonna street , "" but it is not able to sustain that homage or carry on with the fast-paced comedy hi-jinks after the first half hour , and what's worst , it falls into a predictable way of telling the story , which ends the film on a rather pedestrian note . this film had the look of something made in a film factory , without an edge to the routine comedy sequences . but to its credit . . . it had a lot of laughs in it . he seems to have given up being an artistic filmmaker ( i doubt if he ever was committed to being one , but he did like ingmar bergman's "" wild strawberries , "" and at one time attempted to make bergman-quality films ) . he's certainly no risk taker in this film , knowing his audience and giving them what they want might as well be his motto . he is banking on the audience cravings for a few of his patented one-liners to give them a comedy fix until his next predictable work . here's where this sweet and silly story plunges off the comedy map , as it tries to show how tracy now wants to grow as a person and join the highbrows and get some culture , but she can't because she still remains a vulgar person inside despite her new outward trappings . the running gag here is how cheap their taste is in their furnishings , decorations , clothes , and vocabulary , before and after becoming rich . this results in a fluff film , with a twisted message about money not being important to the couple , which seems like an out of the place message , since money is all the couple talks about and seem to care about as a means for their happiness . but this is a film that will only succeed if it can make you laugh and the message wrongly or rightly perceived might as well have not been sent . there are just enough woody sight gags and one-liners to make this film keep its head above water . . . for example , one gag goes like this : "" hey , did you hear the one about that polish car pool that met at their workplace ! ! ! "" "
472,"this is the original film adaptation of the graham greene semi-autobiography . the older b&w version puts less stress on the lust and more on the inner conflict the two lovers are having . it's a more reserved telling of the story , probably due to the conservative time it was filmed than anything else . this version actually leaves a greater impact on the viewer of the momentous tragedy of the self-imposed restrictions religion has placed on the relationship for her . the story never seems illogical , as does the tacky ending to the later version , which tried to get too fancy in its approach to this melodramatic love story . there was no reason to make a remake , and especially so , since the newer version doesn't add anything new to the mix that the older version didn't already have . what evolves through greene's telling of the inner spiritual battle worked out through the characters , is that what is impossible becomes what is religious and man's worldliness is seen as something that is not completely satisfying to him but is something he thinks he needs to satisfy because he doesn't believe in an afterlife . that she loves him so much , that to just have him live will be worth it . the priest responds , "" you made a vow to someone you didn't believe in -- you have the free will to break it . "" but you have also taken the first step toward god , that you could continue with , if you so choose . dmytryk has made an intelligent and cogent version of a tough novel to film , and made it into an impressionable film . the best performances in the film came from the two actors who seemed to be effortlessly acting , john mills , as the detective interested more in the craft of his job than the ethics , though always aware of the moral implications of what he is doing . his pleasurable performance stole the film . in many respects , i found this the more interesting version . what the other version had , was more explicit sex scenes and a better actor playing bendrix . "
473,"mankiewicz does a nice job of creating the dark noir mood . the film is laden with comedy , excellent performances , plenty of suspense , plus a voice-over by john ireland , and it manages to keep the pot boiling with a quintessential amnesiac story . "
474,"this is another in a long line of indie 'buddy films' about desperadoes going on the road . the only thing different about this one , is that it is consciously played for laughs , which gets it through its cartoonish lowbrow humor , as it features characters who all have something about them that is dysfunctional : they are illiterate , have a depraved mental condition , suffer from greed , or just like to kill people . it's a teenager's version of the noir classic "" the treasure of sierra madre , "" lacking the breath and depth in its story to touch base with the classic , but letting its own dimwitted energy do its talking , for what it stands for . the road it takes is across the southwestern desert and across the barren culture of the white trash trailer park crowd . she's a mute and communicates by writing . there is nothing that we haven't seen before in such road films , from a vintage car convertible to a gun fetish to white trash humor , and finally to random violence , but there is a surprise ending here involving , what else , but , betrayal for the gold . even though there were many look-alike films , this black comedy could at least stand alone for the laughs it presented . the characters all had personality , and the force of the movie overall , had a desirable effect , even if it is an easy film to forget and requires as little thinking as possible when viewing . enjoyable nonsense might be an apt description for former adman rod mccall's second feature . "
475,"the story is bogged down with cliches and cardboard characters , while the ballet dancing is the thing of beauty in this film . most of the dancers are professionals of the highest standards and it shows by their excellent performance . the framework of the story is the same formula seen in almost every hollywood sports film , as the art of dancing is only paid lip service to . in fact , if this film wasn't about ballet dancers , it could have been about chorus dancers or football players , and the same trite tale could have been woven . which shows you how much art mattered . the best reason for seeing the film , is that the dancing is alive and pulsating , choreographed by the likes of balanchine , susan stroman and christopher wheeldon , as well as ivanov and macmillan . the film is hip to ballet dancers , letting us in on the secret that many of the male dancers are gay , and a straight dancers is much welcomed by the ladies . and , that they can be easily devasted by criticism of their performance . it is was too much effort following all their predictable stories , especially when you know everything is going to be tied up in a nice pink ribbon by the end . this film reminded me a lot of hollywood's ode to lowbrow culture "" band wagon , "" which was much more entertaining . in center stage , there was plenty of dancing at rehearsals and in the two big ballet numbers they put on , before the film comes to its predictable climax for its soap opera stories . the aim of the film was to be entertaining , the art part it dumbed down for mass consumption , though its story could have been worst than it actually was , as it was kept in check from completely taking over the film . what it comes down to , is that the story didn't completely take away from the dance , therefore the film had some mild entertainment value and some sparkle could be detected in the eyes of the students when they were dancing . "
476,"it's an absorbing story but it was presented in such a mangled way , so a lot of the drama was sucked out of it and it instead became an obvious sob story about an injustice done . this steven zaillian directed film has traces of the same intelligence he has shown in his previous work as director of searching for bobby fischer and as a screenwriter for schindler's list , but loses its fire-power with scenes of endless court hagglings and what seems like an interminable amount of time spent in giving prep classes on how the court system works . this sets-up a battle of david versus goliath . the supporting players all have limited roles compared to the two gunslingers , travolta and duvall , but perform admirably . for all its telling faults in its storytelling ability , the film had an aura of reality about it that the john grisham movies never have . while duvall is shown as the masterful machiavellian tactician with absolutely no heart , whose m . o . what the film failed to do , is to bring a sense of urgency to their presentation . though they were sympathetic to the families' plight and caught the essence of what travolta was up against , which makes it better than most hollywood films , it just couldn't drive the fastball thrown down the middle of the plate over the 'green monster' in fenway park for a home run . the story became less than compelling and more of an exercise about who was the better actor/lawyer duvall or travolta . the great social impact of the lawsuit never caught on during the film , when that should have been the driving force of the film , as it was when grippingly told in the book . "
477,"the simple story taps in on the hatred the railroad people have for the tramps . aldrich for the most part steers clear of the political situation in the country , instead he uses these men as powerful mythic symbols , showing the oppressed versus the oppressor . while borgnine is a sadist , who sports a menacing grin . if the kid could just shut up and be grateful that he is learning how to be a hobo from the king , marvin could have warmed up to him a little . marvin is terrific as the spry and wizened hobo . borgine is a caricature of someone spewing hatred . it's just too bad that the director couldn't connect all the dots with the corrupt political situation that caused this great suffering and left so many with hardened hearts . "
478,"he met the director chris smith when he took a course of his in filmmaking at the university of wisconsin , and smith found that mark's story might be a compelling one , showing how by sheer determination someone can make a film and get it distributed . at the sundance film festival , an appreciative audience found this film hilarious and the festival responded by awarding it the grand jury prize . the film is more interesting when viewed from the angle of mark's personal life and where he's currently at than from him making an ed wood jr . classic film . that he is not always a likable person is also shown , as he uses people and is a bull-shit artist . it all amounts to a home movie more on the level of a precocious teenager than the work of a professional . mark pronounces it with a long 'o' because he doesn't want it to rhyme with oven . but his good will shines through , as every sentence he tries to utter results in a pause and a frivolous giggle . uncle bill is a riot in his lifeless responses to anything mark asks him , wryly amused at how serious mark is over a film he could care less about . mark is indomitable in his pursuit of his dream and chris smith has done a fine job of editing the film and nailing down his subject as accurately as he could , so that the dark side is balanced with the rosy picture mark paints for himself . all this film did was make him a laughing stock instead of the audience discovering someone with a talent for comedy . i have no desire to see coven , watching it being made was enough for me . mark's first words in the film are , "" i was a failure . "" he goes on to say , "" he was a talented kid with a bright future , "" and he wound up at 30 , as mark , with a beer in his hand , thinking about the great american script and the great american movie . "" what more can one say ! "
479,"how she handles the few dramatic moments of her life , right before her high school graduation , is what makes this a very french film . but , i guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder , because he didn't look like a train wreck to me . the beauty in the film is in judith godr ? che portrayal , that gets the most out of the terse dialogue and slim story , as she manages to look alluring in many different poses and who through her vitality and cynicism , always gives off a sense of hope that she will survive , no matter the situation . she fits the lifestyle of the existential hero . . . a female version of a camus hero or a rimbaud protagonist . the film had a very lively pulse which added to its intelligent drama . "
480,"larry cohen's auspicious debut film is a scathing black comedy set in beverly hills . there seemed to be a break down in society and cohen isn't interested in why but in what is happening to the country . but he lets the suspense go to pieces and eases the heavy rape scene with social comedy and gentrified manners . it is sordidly funny in spots and at other times it just seems shrill and pretentious . there were too many flat spots between the mesmerizing opening scene around the swimming pool and the bleak finale in a sand dune , to make this quirky effort work entirely . it seemed to be toying with the audience for its acceptance or disapproval , more than anything else . bone is a film desperately trying to get under one's skin , but doesn't have enough staying power to complete the job , except it leaves one with a lingering feeling of being unduly provoked and still laughing about it . it fits nicely into cohen's concept of film as schlock art . cohen will split the screentime with bill and bernadette at this point . bone had its moments in the sun , but couldn't get out of its shadow in time to say more than boo ! what remains chewy about it , is the bizarre psychology evoked . it is a film that will be pleasing to some much more than it will be to others ; it could be admired for its originality and for its quirkiness , but there are others who might see it strictly as an exploitive film . the film had moments when it was both terribly good and terribly raunchy . "
481,"the film was done much like a jean genet psychological drama . a-lan's soft spoken words are , "" i'm gay . it is easy to get together here . i have many friends : the stud , dandy , and lily . the film is noteworthy for the skilled performances by the two actors and the political message of the film , as delivered in such an oppressive climate as red china . it is a film that reveals how intolerant the government is of both gays and of independent filmmakers . zhang yuan confines the film to the two actors stuck in the police station and it is only via flashback that we get to see a-lan's life unfold . this kind of action is symbolic of china's s & m relationship with its own people . even though it is a stagy film , the drama remains intense , as the explosiveness between the two keeps one glued to the final outcome , wondering how this odd relationship will work itself out . the gray-green and amber background of the park and the shadowy black shades of the public toilets , give the film a somber look . if nothing else , this is a rare glimpse at modern red china's gay denizens , as recorded by a maverick filmmaker . "
482,"saskia emotes in a contrasting understated performance to the energetic amanda's . at one point the sweet talking miriam declares , "" mother , auntie kathy , a girl at swimming--and eunice , those are all the people who have kissed me . "" this is a pointless , violent road movie about two very sick girls , who are not explained or studied , but are just shown to be on a wreckless course of destruction . but judy might also be viewed as a figment of her warped mind , or perhaps she represents someone from the bible , like the avenger named judith who beheaded an enemy of the israelites . amanda displays a death wish , saying , "" i'm bad , i won't change . punishment is all i understand . "" it is not possible to make sense of how these girls relate to each other and how brutally they act . the depravity and depth of alienation she evokes from her character , and the energy that amanda plummer puts into her characterization , make this a fascinating film , if you can ever get past the bleakness of the story . "
483,"a splendid tv movie remake of fritz lang's 1941 man hunt . o'toole's performance is the thing here . why he does it is only given a fuzzy interpretation . clive donner makes o'toole grow into a character that is larger than his country , playing off his petulance , his wit and charm , against his daring skills to look death in the eye and heroically escape his pursuers . what the filmmaker does , is have o'toole make great scenes out of conventional ones . even though o'toole is the one trapped in the hole , the major seems to be the one suffocating on the truth , even as he puts on an air of decorum and lays it into his captive , his talk just sounds like jabbering when compared to o'toole's . in this film , not being able to talk properly , means that you are more of an animal than an animal is . "
484,"it's all about money and pride . the film is long on man-against-nature action scenes filmed with graphic computerized special effects , but short on character development and human drama . it is a commercial film , driven by the usual formula used for disaster movies . it is directed by wolfgang petersen , the german director of "" das boot , "" the best submarine picture ever made . the film succeeds as a nail-biter . when their vessel is down , bobby tells the captain , we gave it good ride . . . words that seem futile and misplaced , though certainly gallant . but it is the only glimmer of intelligent dialogue that appeared to be taking place in the last 45-minutes , ever since the giant waves crested against the boat and the men could only be seen in the dark with their yellow slickers . even though the film has a bleak ending and awkward dialogue , it has blockbuster written all over its sails . i think the public will accept the grim outcome and relish viewing the storm and the terrible damage it causes , because it is the kind of action film they will want to see this summer , while they munch on some popcorn in an air-conditioned theater . "
485,"this scorsese "" mean streets "" type of film has been done too many times and often much better than it was done here , for it to have much of an impact . it was mildly entertaining , setting a wiseguy mood in a wealthy suburban area instead of using the usual locale of the gritty urban streets . but the film had such a pat look to it , i just couldn't help feel that it was phony , an annual staging of a movie about wannabe mafia youths that seems to be the dream-baby of almost every new indie director . it seemed to be striving to get some laughs , release some suburban angst , while trying to find the missing ingredient in its tale of innocence lost . . . which it never found . the 26-year-old first-time director rob weiss , has this low-budget film put all its cards on the action table , moving it along at a fast clip . the weakness of this plot , is that the friendship among the three never seemed to be anything but a superficial one , yet we are supposed to believe it is packed with a great deal of emotion at present . billy is just a bad egg , a weasel . it is difficult to find one thing about him that is likable . i also found it hard to believe that he became a big-time criminal , he just seemed to be too punky . the problem with this creepy friendship tale , one solely based on criminal schemes and drug deals , is ultimately the problem with this film -- because when the friendship breaks up , who cares ! and if we don't care , the film becomes empty , though it's good for a few laughs . "
486,"the story becomes too melodramatic for even these fine performers to bring credibility to it . the camerawork of john alton is the star of this vehicle . he sets a dark mood of the los angeles scenario , escalating the dramatics with shadowy building shots . the noir theme of alienation is richly furnished , but the film had too many scenes that stretched too far afield in disbelief for it to have the necessary flow in it to sustain the tension . stanwyck was just too strong a character to be so completely victimized , so the film became more symbolic than a real flesh and blood story . "
487,"apparently , the judicial system has broken down , so much so that it can't satisfy the political electorate who want stiffer punishment and those who want more of an emphasis on education and counseling programs for the nonviolent offenders . the prison atmosphere of hostility , constant danger , noise , and inhumanity , was fully captured , as the film had the gritty , realistic look of a prison . the convicts looked scary , the prison looked real , and the feeling of despair was the only air that was present , as rehabilitation seemed to be a farce , a show that one puts on to score clemency points from the judges . the acting was just fine . i don't know if anyone seriously believes anymore that the prisons can be a place of rehabilitation . the film does a very good job in bringing this out and creating an entertaining picture because of the fine performances . but it also seemed to stage everything in the story to weigh heavily into what its message was . the film didn't feel like it was freely flowing along , and because of that the story floundered at times .

488,"a taut suspense yarn in b&w , that plays like noir because of all the eerie shadows on the wall and the conviction for murder of an innocent man . this villain role is out of character for the always sweet ann sothern , but she shows great agility in handling the difficult role . the melodramatic script was often not believable and the action part of the story looked like pretend acting , just like the therapy nancy davis was applying to gigi . but the stars pulled this one together and made the tense story , revolving around the little girl , seem plausible . gigi perreau was marvelous , giving a convincing performance as a little girl who could be both adorable and then almost frightened out of her mind . "
489," layin' low  is a charming comedy set in the brooklyn of the 1980s and laden with plenty of colorful city types . the film ends in tragedy , but somehow the film never draws us into that emotional-caring response . the ensemble cast does a nice job in sketching city life for a bunch of idlers . it's a sweet , little mellow story , with a lot of laughs in it , and with some violent scenes which never seemed real , more like play-acting . there was good chemistry among the stars , especially the relationship jerry has with both christy and angie . "
490,"a good old-fashioned mystery yarn , from john dickson carr , but this time instead of the lady vanishes , it is the husband who does . oddly enough , the one person who clearly saw her , the stewardess , denies seeing her . the story itself , if examined closely had many improbabilities , but the strength of the film is in the tension it creates within crain and how she handles it . she had a blind trust in him and it is hard for me to imagine another person in her situation acting as naively as she does . but even if i didn't find the plot to be always plausible , the relationship that developed between her and rennie was credible . this b&w melodrama was always suspenseful : there was the constant heavy fog that made things mysterious . crain seemed so helplessly alone , highlighted by showing her sitting by herself at the dining table and feeling that she is losing her mind , that set the mood for the entire film and her vulnarability is what the viewer identifies with . this excellently paced b-film , is tersely directed and superbly acted . the film seemed to be thrust forward by the credibility of the characters playing parts that were incredible . "
491,"this film has a gentle way of showing the war between the bureaucrats of big business and the little man caught in the squeeze of downsizing for greater company profits . how effective the film was , depended on how much you thought hopkin's change mattered . i only felt i was seeing a frank capra type of social-issue picture , that only goes surface deep , accenting how wonderful and eccentric the little guy is and how cold-hearted are the corporation types , resulting in too many generalizations of each type . but the place has not kept up with the modern times and is in need of a shot in the arm . the film will keep track of how the likable but goofy carey does in the romance department . this happy ending seemed artificial . . . too "
492,"this premise would seem improbable , but in the recent news of the geriatric john glenn going on a space mission for experimental purposes , it shows that their mission is possible , though not in the manner as depicted in this fantasy film . there are a lot of good natured jokes about aging and some friendly ribbing between the young astronauts and the veterans , and it all seems pleasantly entertaining , though somewhat staged . clint even makes fun of some of his older pictures , which i presume is why he has so much fun with the monkey in the opening scene . everything seemed smooth and compliable with a formula movie , and it seemed as if the actors were having a good time acting together . but through the wonderful special effects and the full cooperation of nasa as consultants , there was a sense of awe in seeing the sights of space travel . and , when clint is able to make an impossible landing , something hollywood films are good at doing , there is a sense of relief that the old timer , who now has a lined and craggy face and looks like an american icon , is safe and sound . since the film didn't take itself so seriously , there was no undue tension and everything was fun , even all the contrivances the film allowed for . this is not one of clint's top films , but if it is his swan song , as rumored , there are a lot of reasons why this is not a bad film to end one's career on . the love and affection from his fellow actors comes through loud and clear , in this well-crafted production , which shows clint could direct with the skills that only the most competent hollywood directors possessed , even if clint never reached greatness himself , as he was unable to overcome his artistic limitations . what he couldn't do in this film , was move beyond the easy humor and special effects , and make a film that had something involving to say about old age and those facing death . "
493,"the film is stunningly beautiful , as visually , it is a masterpiece . the film's thessaloniki landscapes are monumental , but at times , the story was pretentious and much too tedious . the other evident influences on the greek filmmaker are bergman's somber look at family life and antonioni's picturesque and quirky photography . but the little dialogue there was seems too supercilious anyway to really matter , as the weight of this film is captured only in its photography . but the story seems too symbolic and arty to make a direct impact , every thought , no matter how banal , has to be philosophically scrutinized , which becomes unnerving . to its credit , the film has certain scenes that stay with you the way a meditation exercise does , that may even alleviate some of the dullness the film generated , but it falls far short of a film that is great . the 66-year-old director has made an accessible film despite its ambiguity , but it was lacking fluidity in its overstated symbolism and its idiosyncratic statement was not that deep for all its huffing and puffing , and pouring out of philosophical thoughts . the film could have ended forty minutes sooner and still would have said what it ended up saying . "
494,"a further vulgarization of shakespeare's most vulgar play that succeeds in going over the top and losing its sensibilities without adding anything worthwhile to take the place of what was lost , yet it is not without its positives . this early tragedy written by the young bard is also his weakest and most turbulent play , casting out dramatical dimensions , poetry , and pity in favor of gore . it is a difficult one to come to terms with , except to see it for its dark humor and parody . anthony hopkins plays titus with the same kitsch he played hannibal lecter , but without the same results . the film was also overlong at 162 minutes , without having a sufficient reason for being that long . cumming's plays his role as an insecure , campy effete , prancing about as a puff , coifed in an adolph hitler hairstyle , as he aims to steal every scene by his gyrations and petulant looks . it all seems glossy and avant-garde , but surprisingly , the film is most faithful to shakespeare's text . titus will then slit her throat with the appetite of a psychopath , smacking his lips with delight as his chef's hat bobs up and down . the emperor's fate is also sealed in a similar manner . not every work by shakespeare has to be great , even though , if the bard wrote it , there has to be something there . this one suffers from worldliness , hollowness , and from having no point to it ; i doubt if any screenplay could rescue it from its banality of violence . julie taymor's version was a good costumed effort to show the violence for all that it is , but in the process making it into a campy grand guignol production . but i found it all coming together too artificially . it was an art-house film , way too fluffy to serve the film's dramatic efforts , as it all seemed like a fellini rip-off , taking the subtlety out of shakespeare's work for all the excesses engendered . "
495,"what saves the lesson from being a reduntant one , is the superb performance of the ensemble cast , all acting in harmony with one another . grant feels like he is just marking time by teaching , that all the kids will just become ditch-diggers anyway , so it is a waste of time teaching them to read . this film adapted from the novel by ernest j . gaines has the mark of truth and morality on its side . it evoked a sense of what rural louisiana was like back in the 1940s for african-americans , and it set the mood for what was to come about in the 1950s and 1960s , as segregation couldn't be justified anymore by a democratic country . what the film lacked was a tension in the story , everything seemed too dry and predictable , except for the theme , which was right on the money .

496,"he considers these episodes to be ernest hemingway-like experiences . with all its fantastic developments and its obscure way to tell a story , the film still remains grounded in reality , accurately picturing the wasteland of suburban life in the 1980s . the charming adrian grenier is appealing to a certain point as the hero who is both naive and adventurous in a self-destructive way . clark gregg plays his role as someone who feels inside like a woman , but who has been a man so long and still looks like one , that there is certain smugness he has that he can be both a man and a woman . but , the story never leaps beyond its startling revelation of a sex change and the devastating reaction it has for his family . it seems to wither towards its climax . when we see him hitting baseballs at a batting range and then beating up someone who makes fun of him , we're into a typical macho hollywood response mode to such problems , and it becomes apparent that this character will remain underdeveloped . the film setups an engaging story but didn't take it anywhere special , as it was a let down after such a fast start and such a promising look at a youngster needing guidance and getting it from such an unlikely source as gregg . you can rest assured , that this offbeat teenager comedy/drama , returns safely back to its genre's teen movie fold by the film's end , and that is its main fault . "
497,"this watchable neo-noir tale is all style and not much on substance . the intense acting and the quirky dialogue , plus the numerous plot twists and the penetrating character study enable the film to be entertaining in a nuanced way . it is also interesting to note that the film pays homage to great mystery writers such as graham greene , ernest hemingway , and malcolm lowry . the film works best as a hard-boiled character study , where eric roberts makes it believable that someone could end up in such an untenable position as he does , yet survive because he has the instincts for survival no matter how bad it gets . it is believable that he ran away from regular life--that he just wanted to test himself , which is the gloomy beauty of the story , giving it its kafkaesque feel . it's a story that doesn't seem to be leading anywhere or have any message to deliver , and thank goodness for that . it's probably a male oriented film more than a film for a general audience , a cult film for those who like offbeat noir films and mystery writers who get drunk and write scripts that have their flawed protagonist put their ladies on pedestals , only to delight in watching them fall off those pedestals . "
498,"these misguided adventures are things a kid needing but not getting parental help might do . he considers these episodes to be ernest hemingway-like experiences . the film with all its fantastic developments and its obscure way to tell a story , still remains grounded in reality , accurately picturing the wasteland of suburban life in the 1980s . the charming adrian grenier is appealing to a certain extent as the hero who is both naive and adventurous in a self-destructive way . clark gregg plays his role as someone who feels inside like a woman , but who has been a man so long and still looks like one , that there is certain smugness he has that he can be both a man and a woman . but , the story never leaps beyond its startling revelation of a father undergoing a sex change and the devastating reaction it has for his family . it seems to wither towards its climax . when we see him hitting baseballs at a batting range and then beating up someone who makes fun of him , we're into a typical macho hollywood response mode to such problems , and it becomes apparent that this character will remain underdeveloped . the film setups an engaging story but didn't take it anywhere special , as it was a let down after such a fast start and such a promising look at a youngster needing guidance and getting it from such an unlikely source as gregg . you can rest assured , that this offbeat teenager comedy/drama , returns safely back to its genre's teen movie fold by the film's end , and that is its main fault .

499,"what saves the lesson from being a reduntant one , is the superb performance of the ensemble cast , all acting in harmony with one another . grant feels like he is just marking time by teaching in such a barren place , that all the kids will just become ditch-diggers anyway , so it is a waste of time teaching them to read . this film adapted from the novel by ernest j . gaines has the mark of truth and morality on its side . it evoked a sense of what rural louisiana was like back in the 1940s for african-americans , and it set the mood for what was to come about in the 1950s and 1960s , as segregation couldn't be justified anymore by a democratic country . what the film lacked was a tension in the story , everything seemed too dry and predictable , except for the theme , which was right on the money . "
500,"the director is ultimately asking the viewer to be the judge , as he seems too preoccupied with painting his canvas with a love that gets stuck somewhere between a lustful sexual romp and one of pathos . what results in an incomplete ending for a film that can't stand clarity except in its photography and its affection for the three flawed main characters ( alice , martin , and benjamin ) . the story seemed jarring at times , its inexorable rhythms and its lack of dialogue seemed out of place with the attempt made in tracking each character down in depth . yet the film seems to work best when it was in a state of murkiness . when things started clearing up and the characters become who we think they were , the big secret doesn't seem that surprising , but how it is handled seems bizarre though not fully credible , as it is perplexing why the main character is so concerned with finding out something about himself that will cause him so much pain when he doesn't have to . yet there is something about this film that is more than meets the eye , even though the film left me unsatisfied , it was still so well-crafted , that i found myself liking it better than i first thought i did . the film does not necessarily go in chronological order , thereby the flashbacks that come without order , are meant to give weight to the story as presented at the time , and will give this rather conventional unhappy family story line a feeling of much more mystery than is needed . but it's too melodramatic , the guilt motivation seems too illogical , and the half-baked psychology fails to explain its characters for it too fully work as drama . the actors were all sweating their lines to make it seem as if they had to dig deep to come up with a gem here and there , but their performances were all finely tuned and seemed to add to the film's need to have confusion be its guiding light . what keeps this film going , is the way it keeps the emotional pot boiling , and just when you are ready to give up on it as merely sitcom stuff , the film bounces back from its wordless silence and halting love dramatics to boil over with fits of liberating agony . there was no dialogue to explain why he's a fugitive or what's on his mind . she turns down this proposal , but with a look more of sadness than of love , she goes to him and says , "" take me , i'm yours if you want me . "" you have to stick with this one and not get too perturbed by the unsatisfying finale to see this one through and then , you might feel its emotional grip growing on you . it's a pure cinematic vehicle , where the pictures tell the story better than the story seems to be told . there was a strangely felt wry humor that underscored the dead serious mood the film had . alexis loret , in his debut film role , gives an interesting performance of someone who is always out of place no matter where he is . but , when it comes to the heavy romance , i didn't feel that this romance was as deep as portrayed . though the director might have implied it had more going for it than sexual gratification , i saw no other convincing reason for the romance . it could be asserted that maternal instincts , soul searching , and misplaced pathos on juliette's part were responsible for the romance , but i couldn't see any other reason but the libido . martin was just not a warm enough character to believe he could generate so much unconditional love . "
501,"a very entertaining kitsch film , with great costumes , a fine sense of adventure , and an ample sprinkling of comedy . this technicolor mgm film is a remake from the 1920 and 1930 films , that were based on a play by edward knoblock . the sets are lavish and fun to look at ; the bouncy acting fits the playfulness of the fantasy story . the mix-ups are devilishly funny , and how the film gets resolved is fun to watch , as there are magic tricks that are performed and songs that are so bad that they are good , and a host of cast members come in and out of the film so seamlessly , adding their stamp of delightful bemusement to a very diverting film , which seems to be effortlessly done . this makes for some lightweight entertainment and some not so bad viewing from purely an entertainment standpoint . "
502,"a modern noir story whose task seems to be to romanticize violence , with the film looking too much , at times , like a tarantino-clone . but there are scenes that are fresh and invigorating , filled with a deadly explosiveness , but somehow the film fails to put it all together to get at what it is trying to unearth from all the gunplay . it looked at that point , that the film would be very energetic , since that scene was so powerful and so crass -- and original . but the filmmaker fell in love with the violence and couldn't control his bad impulses to do the entire film as an exercise in mindless violence . armed with a highly polished script , lots of arty gunfights , and a convoluted , labyrinth story line , more interested in double-crosses and twists in the plot than human feelings , the film turned off on too many dead-ends to fulfill its potential . if you like gunplay done as choreography , as in recent hong kong action films or in sam peckinpah's "" the wild bunch , "" and films that prefer violence to sex , action to thinking , and films that discard humor for references that film buffs can go bananas over , a film that models itself after classic movies of criminals on-the-run , then you could be on board for this one , at least , more than other viewers who might find this film is not as good as the films it is imitating . parker and longbaugh are the real-life surnames of butch cassidy and the sundance kid . a shapeless story and an unmoving character portrayal of its anti-heroes get in the way of "" the way of the gun "" for director-writer christopher mcquarrie , who won an academy award for his unusual script in the overrated "" the usual suspects . "" he has come up with a reasonably intricate script here for his debut film as a director , but it lacks a certain flow and credibility for it to be a bravura debut . there was a stop-and-go flurry in the action causing the story to grow dull , with guns always the answer to whatever the problem , and its situations took on a suspension of disbelief , leaving a huge void onscreen amid the dark ambivalence of the story line . but what was always absorbing was the actors spouting lines that seemed to come out of their mouths in an unnatural manner , yet had a touch of playfulness , as they mugged for the camera . unfortunately , the film doesn't have any touching moments to fall back on and there is no one worth caring about , so in the midst of all the violence , it is fair to ask what is it all about , besides being a parody on such films . the violence and gore that ensues , plus the twists to the story , offer no big surprises . in fact , it almost seems like hundreds of other "" b "" films , contrary to what the director might think . his role took him in and out of the film , as it didn't seem to matter what he was spouting , he could have been doing the script to another film it wouldn't have mattered , he still was the film's source of charisma even if he was cast in a supporting role . i was amused with his definition of karma , saying karma is just a belief in justice where you don't even get the pleasure of seeing justice in your lifetime . it's an inaccurate definition of karma , but it was one spot in the film that made you think . but basically this is the type of film that gives ammunition to those who are bashing hollywood for its exploitive tendencies to sell violence . in the last third of the film juliette lewis is a bloody mess , having a baby all the characters pretend to have an interest in , even the fatalistic parker becomes concerned about the baby , but while she is having an excruciatingly painful delivery , one of the film's many shoot-outs is taking place . it seemed the film was more interested in the shoot-outs than in getting to anything else to say . the film was pleasing in the most superficial of ways without offering anything to say about the inner workings of the two thugs who are the centerpiece of the film . the camerawork was superb , and even though the gunplay was phony it filled the screen with stylized action scenes that were mindlessly diverting . the film could be viewed as a guilty pleasure for those who realize that the script let them down but the actors came through with flying colors . they got the graphic violence down pat for a few sparkling thrills , and the film showed that violence is so pervasive in society that even a woman gets punched in the nose by the gunmen , which i guess , goes for equality in this film ! a film that has future cult popularity written all over its ambivalent signature , as the violence had an unsettling nature to it that will probably grow on art-house viewers of thrillers who will catch it on video . there is something intangible about this film that is a reflection of present day society and its ever-increasing nihilistic ways . what the film doesn't do , is go beyond exploiting this nihilism . "
503,"the set is bristling with problems and tension . while the topical story is about the business and cynicism involved in making a picture , and the vanity of those in the field , its deeper concern is with understanding the personal nature of failure , insecurity , and disappointment . the film borders on soap opera but manages to get beyond it because of the intelligent discretion of minnelli in his directing and the fine acting from the two male leads , with robinson's performance being nothing short of brilliant , enough to lift this film on his shoulders alone to a loftier dimension . "
504,"their relationship becomes the heart of the film , rather than the mystery story . the film's main asset is that it is played as a psychological character study of the jane fonda character , who becomes a prostitute because she can control men and is good at it . their love affair which emerges unexpectantly , is unsettling to both of them , but real feelings develop on both sides , to the surprise of each , and how they resolve it , is what gives this film its bit of magic . the film takes us into bree's world of pimps , high-rollers , prostitutes , and drug-addicts , a world klute thinks is pathetic . these scenes were too predictable and offered no real insight into that underground world of prostitution , leaving many dry spells in the thin story line . jane fonda did get into the head of an intelligent call-girl who is searching for answers to her life , enough so she won a best actress oscar for her performance , though i thought she was at times shrill and played the role with too much of a calculated effort . i actually preferred donald sutherland's contrasting role , even though the film wasn't about him , i thought his normalcy was harder to convey than her hipster role . it was a film about conflicts over emotional involvement and independence , whereas i thought fonda could recover more easily from this tragic part of her life than sutherland could . klute was fresh when it came out in the 1970s , but time has taken away much of its boldness . even the semi-nude scenes are very tame by today's standards . "
505,"inspired by a pushkin novel , which it considerably watered down , "" the eagle "" has been adapted to the screen by the sure-handed clarence brown , in a tribute to the kind of adventure story douglas fairbanks popularized in his silent 1922 robin hood film and in his zorro role in 1920 the mark of zorro . this film is a tale of adventure , romance , and intrigue , with a good deal of tongue-in-cheek comedy thrown in to help the predictable story out . it was a very popular film in its time . this , his penultimate film , is a good example of how his mannered acting and striking latin looks , made him a ladies favorite . the film also has the great art designer , william cameron menzies , do its breathtaking sets . carl davis does the musical arrangements in the updated film version , adding the russian touch to the ongoing screen action , with music by tchaikovsky , rimski-korsakoff , and prokofiev . the film was set in the 18th century , but the costumes were from more modern times . valentino is dashing in the role , but it is difficult to see what made him so popular from this movie . i feel the same way about james dean when i see his films . but there must have been something beyond what was seen onscreen to explain his tremendous appeal . this satisfying film is a good one to determine for yourself what there is about him that had his lady fans swoon over him . it is a large-scale picture , giving him a chance to do both action and romantic scenes , the kind of serious acting he wasn't asked to do in his previous films . "
506,"brian de palma is a commercial filmmaker who imitates other noted filmmakers but has not met with the same artistic success as a hitchcock or a coppola , ones he in particular gravitates towards ; but , by adding his own brand of sleek cinematography and gratuitous violent action scenes to jazz his films up , he at least salvages some identity of his own . but what antonioni does , is make you wish to penetrate his film , he makes you think about what you are seeing . coppola will challenge you to have a political view of what you are seeing . their films are so well-received as art films because they go beneath the surface of things , they have something to say . while de palma's films are all surface vehicles , there is nothing to think about . his films are pretty to look at and are good at simulating what an art film is , but they are more interested in being entertaining than anything else . therefore , even if "" blow out "" pretends to be like the above mentioned films , it is in style only . this film will prove itself in the end to be without sufficient weight to be put in the heavyweight class . it's mired in the lightweight class , working as an effective film mostly because it has a sense of humor and travolta is convincing as the unlikely hero fighting against political corruption . the running gag is that he needs a perfect scream for his current film , a psycho-like one , with a shower slashing scene , and the actresses auditioned can't give a realistic one . you can guess where he gets a perfect realistic scream by the film's conclusion . this is an obvious reference to teddy kennedy's chappaquidick political scandal . the film was taut and exciting to this point , but there are several breakdowns in the story , as it veers into the slasher film mode . de palma has moved solidly into mundane territory , jettisoning ideas in favor of high-tech shots and thrilling action scenes . "" blow out "" has moved into the range of the unbelievable horror films , worrying more about special effects than about having an intelligent story . this was not the gloomy theme the public wanted to see , as "" blow out "" was never popular in its day . it had received mixed reviews from the major film critics at the time , but the film , even though it was an uneven one , has caught the attention of some current film critics and film buffs , and is now established as a cult-favorite . i thought it was limited in scope but because of the flashy camerawork , the fine performances by both travolta ( his first major starring role ) and lithgow , and the many thrills it provided , it was easy to watch and just as easy to put out of my mind . "
507,"the moody atmospheric film moves at a snail's pace , giving me the impression that it is about to say something important , but everything turns out to lead forlornly down a dead-end . also , the main characters are not the nicest of people , making it difficult to sympathize with them . it could be said that this was one of the director's more trying melodramatic efforts , except for the stylish photography and the use of mediterranean shades of yellow , orange and brown for its outside shots , and for the indoor shots of the many rooms it shows , there are various shades of blue , to give the film a pleasing artistic look . for antonioni , contrast is the main thing to show about life : as sometimes things go good , sometimes things go rotten . the story , the dialogue , the characters , and the pace of the film are done in such a lethargic way , that it radically diminishes the love story . even the sex , which was plentiful , is carried out in such an unenthusiastic way , that it wasn't erotic . yet , what gives the film a certain sense of elegance , underlying its ennui , is that the director is aiming all his guns at being thematic . this is a film that could only expect to be well-received by a receptive intellectual audience of antonioni film buffs , who have the patience and understanding to embrace its arcane premises , vexing story , and the litany of existential themes the director is prone to . niccolo is anxious to find out who she knew that might be doing this , but his search is done in such a half-hearted way , that it creates little tension . the film's main purpose is not the story or the mystery , but in showing the difficulty it is to have a successful relationship in these civilized times . everyone's life seems to be too complicated to just love each other without finding other reasons to either breakup or stay together . the film goes out of its way to show how alienated and isolated the main characters are : mavi and niccolo are driving in a fog that is so thick one can't see anything , as they get lost for awhile while walking on the highway ; there are countless shots of doors opening and closing and of serious people talking to each other but not communicating . the only logical thing niccolo can say at the party to mavi is , "" do all your parties have this sectarian atmosphere ? therefore , he will make a film that is impossible to digest , about spacemen going to the sun to find out what the source of power means to mankind . it's a film stuck on ideas and many metaphors , but they are dragged around by a static story , trying too hard to show how negative and cold the world has become . the film is not helped by having its central character being such a selfish and uncaring dolt , while pretending to be an intellectual . most of the warmth in the film came from the photography , which is not enough of a reason for me to get over how vacant the story felt . yet , it is a film from the master director antonioni , covering his favorite theme of alienation , and he is someone whose poorer films are still worth seeing , as there is always some nugget to be found . the nugget i found , is that the director is suggesting that in this "" age of alienation , "" it is more fun and realistic to make a childlike fantasy film than an idealized love story . "
508,"she is also seen in a bold light offering her impulsive opinions about anything , which sometimes are so blunt that they hit the mark , whereas a more educated person might not have been able to say what she did in such an offhand manner and gotten away with it . what this film has going for it , are its originality of story line , the brashness of the star and of the 35-year-old mexican director , carlos marcovich , and the unpredictability of where the film is going . the problem i had with it is , at times , i lost interest in the flighty story . this film closely resembles what a free-spirited college student could do on a videocam , though here every scene looks beautifully shot and all the improvisationals have an air of professionalism about them . but i wouldn't go overboard in praising the brashness of the film , as it seems to be based on very low expectations for what a movie should be about . its entertainment values are easily met by the overall zestiness of the film and its zany characterizations , which give the film a look of rebellion ; but , its failure to uncover an interesting story or have characters with more mature views , makes this film seem flimsy . she replies , "" i didn't know you'd be so ugly . "" the film is loose and brash , filled with youthful exuberance and energy ; it constantly introduces peripheral characters , such as neighbors , relatives , and casual acquaintances , into the story , who add a cartoonish flavor to it . but the film is too scattered to mean much . it resonates only in flashes , as scenes change on the go before anything could be developed . this real-life look at yuliet took place in the years from 1995-1997 . her story has some merits . . . if the film's superficiality doesn't get under your skin . i would have to say that he won , getting away with a very slight film that is full of energy thanks to the veracity of yuliet's performance and the hectic rhythmical ways he filmed the story , which gives the film its poetical strength .

509,"lars von trier ( breaking the waves/the idiots ) , one of the danish founders of dogme '95 , that gimmicky method of filming only with certain sparse cimematic rules , creates this film in drab digital video and with a hand-held camera . he has the flair for showbiz promoting , and has created a film that pulls every string in the book hollywood wrote about making tearjerkers , but without the love for those musicals that a jacques demy had when he revitalized the hollywood musical with his brilliant "" umbrella's of cherbourg . "" this film is a captivating love it or hate it musical melodrama , one that should divide its audience to either pole , that unfairly pulls cards out of its sleeve to make sure its case against the death penalty can't lose . the story's heroine is played by icelandic pop singer-composer bjork , who won the best actress prize at the recent cannes film festival , with childlike simplicity and unbelievable dumbness on her part , allowing her character to lack depth . the film won the prestigious palme d'or for best picture . praise from abroad for this film has been far greater than the less than warm reaction its has gotten from most film critics in the states . that scene was a typical contrived one that von trier uses , throwing it in the viewer's face that everything about this film is shamelessly rigged and there's nothing you can do about it . i got the feeling , that if you don't accept his world-socialist view of things , you are made to feel like you are on the wrong side . then the most startling thing about this so far very manipulative and dull story takes place , flighty song and dance numbers break out everywhere among the characters , as fantasy and reality get intermeshed , and original songs written and performed by bjork and inventively choreographed by vincent paterson are acted out -- where some numbers take place in the factory , the rehearsal hall , a railroad bridge and the courtroom . these numbers were hardly memorable , but they were attention getting since they didn't fit the action and had a bizarre look to them . what they all had was a verve , like something important was happening , rather than the songs and dances being good music . yet there was something about this break in the story line that interrupted the boredom of the story and gave the film renewed life . it was the only time the film wasn't dried out by the manipulative story and seemed like a true cinematic fantasy experience . it was the only thing in the film that seemed to be innovative and chancy , as for once the director stopped exploiting the poor dumb woman for a brief respite , before carrying on with making her into a martyr . i don't think the director made his point that well against the death sentence by making the trial and her death such a blatant mockery . all those scenes were obviously phony , a set-up for the director to force his beliefs down the viewer's throats . everything about this film was unreal and embedded with such an effete snobbishness to show only its view was the right one about how the system works . it seems as if von trier is , as always , the ego-driven publicist and never the artist first and he is always seeking to gain attention for his views about society , without giving me the sense that he really cares about what he is railing against . i never for one moment in this film thought he cared about selma's suffering , her blindness , or that he viewed any of the workers with real understanding . his point of how economic conditions makes one a murderer seemed too simple a generalization to take seriously . it also seems to me that he used the hanging only because without it he couldn't finish the job he had of exploiting her suffering to the extreme . billy wilder in his "" double indemnity "" didn't have to use the electric chair to get across his point about how the justice system operates , neither was it used by tay garnett in his superior 1946 "" the postman always rings twice . "" both films in their earnest telling of a real story , make a better argument than von trier does against capital punishment , even though he uses every heart-tugging trick there is to make his case . he does this because what he really believes , is that he must shock an audience in order for his film to work , he doesn't seem to be able to operate in any other way . the best i can say for him about this film , was that as trying as it was to watch it and as difficult as it was not to feel exploited by the story , his film had a quality about it that kept connecting with so many things that are interesting , that despite the dullness of the film and despite my resentment at his methods of filming , i was still enthralled about the film . but i have come to think of him now , after watching his film career evolve , as less of an artist and more of a showman . they speak english in this film , but the film doesn't feel like an american one . it has the static energy of a film made in communist czechoslovakia . von trier has never been to america and most of the actors in this film are foreigners , and the story is not a very believable presentation of america and how its judicial system works , unless you want to take extreme cases as the rule . with this film , he is the one dancing in the darkness , but brazen enough to give one the impression that he is re-inventing cinema . i take him for a charming huckster , with enough vitality in his films to pull the hustle off . i just don't trust him as a filmmaker . this is the most exploitive and least riskiest film he has made to date , in my humble opinion . the only risk he took in this film , is that he would torture the viewer to death by all his contrivances and the brutally slow-pace of the film , and by the song lyrics being so empty a gesture to hollywood , and therefore there is the possibility of him not making the 'big bucks' he envisioned by bringing his act to america . "
510,"a fine sequel to the 1956 "" the curse of frankenstein . "" there is some additional hokum about the new person becoming a cannibal , if his brain does not heal properly after the operation . this theme is what sustains the b- film with a deeper meaning to the frankenstein myth and keeps him from being a one-dimensional villain . but , overall , there was a staid quality about the film that kept it from being as gripping as it could have been . needless to say , the film was hardly believable , as everything about it was disputable . yet it was entertaining and the cast did a good job , all things considered . "
511,"director-writer andrew l . stone keeps the terse story tense despite the almost certain proof the murder suspect is indeed the guilty one , but he leaves open that it is not absolutely certain until the climactic scene . at first , cameron is reluctant to believe that the very loving , prim and pretty lynne is capable of murder . this is a well-acted thriller and it is directed with some nice touches , as when cotten is romancing her on the deck and a door opens to a burst of laughter from some ship party goers . at that point the air went out of cotten , as he thought maybe it wasn't murder , but the druggist made an honest mistake , after all these kind of accidents happen all the time . "
512,"he is burdened with an unbelievable melodramatic story and the dullish performance of his femme fatale co-star , faith domergue , as the alluring margo lannington , two obstacles that are difficult to overcome . faith is the gorgeous protege of studio boss howard hughes , and makes her inauspicious film debut here . this is a film that is always enticing but could have been much better served with a different femme fatale playing faith's part . it was beautifully photographed by nick musuraca in the dark b&w style of noir and so ably directed by john farrow , who successfully caught the nightmarish visions of the tale . it is interesting mostly as a character study of a capable man blinded by lust whose life is almost destroyed . mitchum's convincing portrayal of the innocent man on the run , is what makes the soap opera story more compelling than it ought to be . spoiler to follow : proceed to last paragraph if you don't want to know the ending . the movie plays like a noir clich ? . but mitchum saves the day , realistically showing how a swell guy and such a competent doctor could be so vulnerable . claude rains as always is magnificent , in a small part but one where his every gesture seems to be constrained in a maniacal rage ready to burst open . "
513,"this tearjerker melodrama proved to be a big hit commercially for the popular silent star mary pickford . there is one scene where they both are together , and this was accomplished by the method of double-exposure . skip to the last paragraph if you don't want to know how the story is resolved . undoubtedly , the film is dated , but for its time and the excellent way the film was crafted , it succeeds as a popular soap opera type of vehicle . though , by having pickford , "" america's sweetheart , "" commit a murder , its ethics and reasons for doing so can certainly be questioned , though the happy ending satisfied the public . many film critics felt that this was the best role that pickford ever had . though the film was as heavy as goo , it was not without some passing interest for mainly historical reasons . "
514,"a rehashed formula action/sci-fi film about the near future that looks old hat and plays like low-brow entertainment even as it advances the sophisticated problems cloning might eventually hold . maybe it's because the film tried to be both preachy about its social conscience message and at the same time your typical arnold schwarzenegger action film , that it looked so confused , seeming as fuzzy and as unbelievable as the instant cloning process it featured in the film . but , as for the film's entertainment value , it passes the test for mild escapist fare , and to the bargain you have two arnold's saying lame one-liners for the price of one . but , even if this film is not as good as his "" total recall "" or "" true lies "" or even "" terminator 2 , "" it should be good enough to be accepted by his loyal following . how it will do in the box office and with the general public , is hard to say , as the film seems gloomily cluttered with nocturnal shots and the action is less than spectacular , and it is not as stylish as some other recent popular action films ( eg . and , how the public will respond to the aging arnold saving the world from an evil clone manufacturer who is merely a greedy businessman and not a super-villain , in a pg-13 film without an edge , is anyone's guess , especially since arnold's popularity is slipping . in this film he is asked to carry the load , though helped somewhat that the film is well executed , has good enough special effects and a semi-plausible cloning theme . but , he still cannot overcome the overall mediocrity of the film . for its thought provoking moments , the film wants to draw its battlelines over good science vs . bad science , showing how drucker's corporation greedily makes money off science and profits greatly from its illegal operation . philosophy is not one of the film's strong points , as there is a muddled argument for each position presented . for him , there is nothing higher than human love . he's the most interesting one in the film , so it behooves me that he has a truncated part , which fails to give him the depth needed to draw out his character and go further than the drab figure he is portrayed as , being a good scientist used by an evil businessman . "" we have a lifetime contract with a vegetable . the joke being , that you don't have to die , the corporation can clone you in no time at all ( hardly believable ) , if they have your genetic code , and the cost is a only mere one and a half million bucks . it's all been seen before , but the film seems easy to take or leave , and is only mildly offensive to both those who like their films with a bit more intelligence and those who prefer a lot more rough action . this film will live and die not by its story , but by what you think of its action scenes . i thought they were good enough in a functional sense , but there were just too many dead spots in the story for me to find this big-budget film anything more than a minor work . "
515,"but lugosi couldn't pull it off being a surgeon and ends up in a minor part as the gangster marnay . the gangster red cannon sustains paralysing spinal injuries and is taken to the same hospital as kingsley . "" black friday "" was fast-paced , had a good cast , and had an interesting story but it could have probably been more interesting if the story wasn't so convoluted . it's a thriller that could have used a few more thrills , suffering mostly from the flat way it was directed . the results are a mixed bag , but there's enough entertainment to be gotten from this b-film , to make it a satisfying watch . "
516,"an above-par courtroom drama , set in los angeles , elevated by director/screenwriter clifford odets' sharp script . he originally intended for this work to be a play . it was also elevated by an outstanding cast , with special kudos to rita hayworth's warm portrayal of a woman in an abusive marriage and by sanford meisner's forceful and expressive performance as the cross-examing prosecutor . the beauty in the film is in the long-drawn-out courtroom dramatics . the story itself wasn't too interesting , but the performances were energetic and the film had a good courtroom style , enough to make this chatty film well worth seeing . "
517,"an alluring biopic about the provocative comedian andy kaufman that couldn't go futher than to provide an entertaining look at the entertainer . if one was looking to find out who andy kaufman was , this film would be of little help . the point of the film being that there was probably no difference between the performer and the person off-stage , therefore it believes by telling the story through only his performances should give one a good enough idea of who andy was . the kaufman role was tailor-made for jim carrey and he comes through with flying colors in a virtuoso performance , as this fictionalized biography of kaufman , shows his odd personality , obsessions , and mind-set . the film seemed flat in the parts when carrey wasn't performing and his story seemed superficial . i didn't feel as if i knew him any better because of this film than i did before , though , at least , the film didn't try to answer something it couldn't . but "" man on the moon "" was entertaining , even for someone like me who has never been impressed by his comic talents . i am andy . "" this might be the way it happened , but it made for bad cinema since he wasn't seen as being funny and his immediate rise to fame lacked credibility as it was filmed , even though we know it evidently did happen . the heart of the film and indeed what keeps it lively , is watching carrey go through his repertoire in a flawless comic manner . milos forman's uneven film is missing the true craziness of kaufman in the entirety of the story . he gets that ingredient not from the conventional way he tells the story but only from jim carrey's expressive performance , as the film went from bursts of great energy with carrey doing andy to dullness in storytelling . her part was so underwritten that there weren't even hints of where the romance or sex in it was , and there appeared to be no intimacy between them . she just seemed to be andy's prop , who looks delicious on the screen but was given nothing to do , but one turn on the wrestling mat . i can't help thinking , that aside from carrey's masterful performance , there's not much in this film to take away with you . the film seems to be an unadultered homage to kaufman , looking on the rosy side of his lunacy and not getting at anything else . kaufman seemed to always be searching for something , whether in studying transcendental meditation , looking for a psychic cure for cancer in the philippines , or a way to push the limits of comedy to a further degree , and what we see in the film , is that he never quite found what he was looking for , in a career that was far too short for a man of his energies and stated talents . "
518,"a quintessential noir film , more entertaining and atmospheric than essential viewing , featuring a hard-boiled story , average though it may be , which goes beyond the main character getting killed in the first reel to spend the rest of the film examining why he lost interest in living anymore . there is also the recognizable cinematography of this genre , which is darkly shot , using shadows to frame its shots , long close-ups to show fear and to overall create a mood for what has become known in film lore as the noir world . and swede , while lying in bed in a darkened room replies , "" i did something wrong . . . the film is more or less a pessimistic reaction to the post-war period and of the greed and lust that blinded those who typify the kind of characters who dwell in the noir world , a place where corruption is the norm . it should also be noted that miklos rozsa's musical score was later used by dragnet . "
519,"a depiction of hell , resulting in a messy , sweeping political picture set in 1995 , where all the action takes place on a 12 degree winter night in belgrade , showing a breakdown in 'law and order . ' it was brutal to watch , more intense and more in your face than more recent films on serbia , one that had no subtlety or artistic edge , as the gruesome little scenes ran together in a heavy-handed manner and no voice of reason emerged , or no one to sympathize could be found , except for the all too obvious loss of overall humanity that was pictured . there isn't , unfortunately , one thing to take away from this film that could help you understand the situation better , except to truly see the hopelessness of the situation , and one could have gotten that from reading the newspapers . it's the kind of film that might have a greater impact in the homeland ( which it did ) than throughout the world , as it gives the people of belgrade a chance to look in the mirror and see what they look like to the rest of the world . this is something that could happen in the states , but not likely to this extreme because more than likely the police would have resolved it . probably the most violent sketch , in a film that was a total gross-out ( and i couldn't argue if you chose another scene as more sadistic ) , is the one between two longtime friends sparring at a gym . this serves as a perfect metaphor for what the director is saying about the current thugs running the country . the film had a raw power to it which cannot be denied , but that power was also the film's main fault , as everything about it was just too obvious and too bleak , it couldn't stop showing a country that seemed to have lost every ounce of its humanity , making every character out to be either a loser or a sadist -- probably not unlike president milosevic and his constituents . the film's theme is simply taken from a quote by one of its characters : "" this is a goddamned lousy country ; why would anyone want to come back ? '' that seems to be true from what i have seen , but the question for me , is why would anyone want to see this film ? and , i think the answer is , that in all the brutality shown , it is hard to deny that there is a truth that the film shows . the horrors of that country seem to be an everyday thing , and after seeing this film , one can only feel dazed and revolted by what is going on . but this is not an entertaining film ( i don't consider the film's gallows humor to be entertaining ) and it is not for those who like their war films with good guys they can identify with . . . it's a message film , saying these kind of horrors happened many times in history before and they will continue to happen if we forget history . i have no problem that the film wasn't entertaining , my problem with the film was that it wasn't informative about the human condition in a way that wasn't so obvious and in a way that could involve the viewer more with its characters . "
520,"a stunningly original film , but one that is hardly plausible . yes . it is entertaining to a certain degree . the terror seemed more theatrical than real inner angst , which took away from the film's tense scenes . the film's theme , a recurring one in filmmaker cronenberg's repertoire -- of an unhappy body in a palace revolt -- suggests in no uncertain terms that dreams can kill . . . and that anger if unchecked is something that takes its toll on the individual and on others . this transference method is called "" psychoplasmics . "" the story proceeds on an erratic course of mixing gore and shock with cerebral challenges , never establishing which one it is more commmitted to , as the story moves too far adrift to maintain a credible suspense . instead it relies on the intense performance of oliver reed , as the so-called genius experimenter who lost track of right and wrong , to pull you into the politics of what the film is saying about ethical medicine and the implications it has for the patients and society . i say . . . there's it's a film that could easily be viewed as being about a bad marriage and an even uglier separation , in other words a domestic drama with the trappings of a horror film . while throwing out a lot of nauseating sights and many themes , the film failed to hold together to make this a solid effort , but if viewed for its parts rather than its sum , it had some very strong scenes of relating one's body problems to the constraints of the mind . in any case , it's more cerebral than the usual special-effect horror film and is worth seeing for its uniqueness . "
521,"for those who love the following in their horror tales : schlock , an old-fashioned grand guignol story , and a hammy performance from its star , it should be noted that this film has all that . well . . . you the film was atmospheric -- plenty of cobwebs , dark corners , and ghoulish creatures around to add to the eerie tale . i suppose it was chilling enough but it still lacked that missing magical ingredient to make this a more satisfying film . i think the problem was that the story dragged after the exciting opening scene and never could pick up steam again . this turns out to be a minor film from roger corman's oeuvre , not up to his other more daringly told horror tales . . . yet , it is enjoyable in a goofy sort of way . "
522,"a cute family drama/comedy about destiny and the choices one makes . this indie film is set in chicago , comparing the protagonist's working-class background in the produce market with the high culture of the opera world he rejected . but . . . the george seems in a rut . . . not her managers have a divided opinion about giving george a shot at singing something spontaneously in her show , but she sides with giving him a chance , as she aims to make opera more accessible to the public and not to be only for the purists . the film ultimately is about whom does she love more -- the artist or the prominent politician . i bet you can guess who wins ! this was a likable but not a particularly moving tale . the characters were pleasing , but no more . the situation they were in seemed realistic , and the way they handled themselves gave the film its comedy sparks . but what the film was missing , was sparks from the romance . what the film also lacked was a more telling story and a bit more tension . it seemed to be played too loose and easy , as if the problems that come his way were part of the problems one would expect to find in any sitcom . nevertheless , i loved the atmosphere the film created -- of mixing the stock workingman types with the stock opera types , and with george cutting a nifty path to his destiny between his two chosen fields of endeavor . as for the opera singing -- let me shout from the rafters , bravo ! ! ! "
523,"when you can't get sissy spacek to be your star and you get porn star marilyn chambers instead , things should become sexier . chambers is fine as rose , even though her sexual abilities are put under constraints by the conservative nature of the script . the side effect that occurs is freaky indeed -- she develops a fanged phallus under her armpit . he has some fun with this theme , taking on the subject matter with mock seriousness , showing a series of attacks caused by marilyn . there is also an incident in the porno theater , which could have been funnier . the film ably depicts the city in a panic and shows the victims foaming at the mouth , reduced to madness . these scenes are mostly played for shock value , but have a certain sophisticated humor about them and relate a concern about medical procedures , alerting us to the fact that doctors have the power to do just about anything to their patients . one of film's main faults , is that it offered no characters that we could care about , but it instead developed an offbeat story that had some kind of political message hidden in its humor . it was quite enjoyable in a less than biting way . "
524,"party ( director/writer : manoel de oliveira ; screenwriter : agustina bessa-luis ; cinematographer : renato berta ; editor : valerie loiseleux ; cast : michel piccoli ( michel ) , irene papas ( irene ) , leonor silveira ( leonor ) , rogerio samora ( rogerio ) ; runtime : 95 ; gemini films / madragoa filmes ; 1996-portugal / france ) the couple are shown to be avid collectors who like to pretend they care about culture but really have these objects only to impress others . she explains the absurdity of the world by saying , "" the world belongs to lunatics like hitler and mussolini -- there're the ones who are most noticeable . "" there's a surprise ending , which nicely resolves this little love conundrum . the film appeals to the intellect to answer its questions about love , but fails to be appealing emotionally . it was just too chatty and the characters always seemed to be symbols , too unapproachable to be considered as real people . but i'm a big fan of michel piccoli and irene papas , and i found their performances to be very stimulating--which is reason enough to see this art house film . "
525,"a superficial but entertaining roller-coaster-ride of nonstop action featuring clich ? characters and contrived dangerous situations , mainly conceived to show off the special effects . the story is so slight that there is no danger of it interfering with the action scenes . it's a hollywood blockbuster for those in need of escaping reality for two hours and should prove to be enjoyable for those who are willing to go with the flow of the action and suspend their critical judgment . the reward will be a visual treat of well-executed stunts and a film that had the glossy look of a national geographic photography shoot . movie viewers could go snowblind just watching a series of mountain catastrophes befall the adventurous climbers , as the film throws out almost any possible danger there is to be found on a mountain and the mountain climbers try to overcome these impossible obstacles and , there is , needlessly to say , a race-against-time sequence , with a last second rescue in the works . the opening eight-minute scene , derivative as it is , is brilliantly done and captures whatever underlying tension the film was to later on build up to . she is still upset with what peter did and could hardly face him , much less talk to him about it . the commercial motive for the climb and the callous way he will soon treat his fellow climbers , makes him the film's designated one-dimensional villain , and adds some more spice to a film that is overspiced already with clich ? s . the rescuers will try to blast the victims out of the cavern , but must be very careful when climbing because with just one spill of the explosive liquid there is the certainty of a tremendous explosion . there will be many tremendous explosions that rock the himalayas , and -- if mountains repeatedly exploding and climbers falling down mountain peaks in colorful ways is your idea of enjoyment , then this is the film for you . the action keeps coming , the clich ? s get resolved somehow , and even though the action sequences couldn't possibly be real , the great photography and beautiful vistas made the locations seem out of this world . the filmmaker used the southern alps in new zealand as his setting , and you could have fooled me , because it sure looked like the himalayas . it also looked like it could be a long commercial for beautiful yuppie adventurers who are shooting an ad for club med , or a national geographic tv special , or even one of those action thrillers that doesn't believe it needs good dialogue to tell its heroic fantasy story . "
526,"it is richly adapted from a jeffrey eugenides novel by director sofia coppola . the film is an evocative visual depiction of a typical suburban family and community . it dwells on the sadness found under all the attractive girls's smiling faces , leaving one with a lingering feeling of helplessness about their situation . adolescence is scrutinized by sofia coppola in a cinematically crafted manner , finely inspired by what we think we remember about that age when looking back at it , with the implication that the girls at that time knew more about the boys than the other way around . the boys , except for one , are insecure and clumsy around the girls . edward lachman's photography has a mesmerizing look to it , as he seems to have his camera covered with a filter to make the shots appear fuzzy , which complements a story that can't be completely put together because we don't know the answers as to why the girls' did what they did . despite liking much about the film and respecting the eclectic approach the director used , i still found that this film wasn't talking to me . i felt i was asked to be a mourner at a once in a lifetime story that has the possibility to pop up some day on the tv news as one of those bizarre events that just happen without cause , but the story itself went no deeper than how the tv news would cover it . the exploration of the teens in their growing pains , their ordinary wants , and even in their grandeur , left me scratching my head at this allegorical tale , wondering how it was that the sunshine couldn't get inside them , why they were symbolically cut down in life like the diseased elm tree in front of their house was , where i could at least see the disease in the tree's yellow leaves . i don't know how much of their futility i could see , as the more i thought about them , the more they seemed like ghosts than real people , and they all started looking like each other , so i couldn't distinguish one from the other , except for lux , who for some reason in all her boldness and sexuality , couldn't find the strength to live . which left me perplexed as to why the film thrived on not telling a complete story . if i tried to know more about the girls , i would only become like the shrink , giving off pat answers to something that was supposed to remain a mystery . i don't know if this is a good or a bad way for a film to leave the viewer , but i do know i felt something profound was missing here , as the film was more revealing about the boys and their idealization of the girls than it was about the girls and what they were really like . this seemed misplaced storytelling , since the girls' story should have been more compelling than the boys' awkward adolescent tale was . what saves this film , is the innovative way the director filmed the story , covering up the fluff to make the story look deeper than it was .

"
528,"a slight melodramatic story , but an efficiently made moral tale with noir overtures . this film does a good job of poking holes at that dream , showing underneath the surface all is not well . but the nightmare indicates more than that , as it indicates there is something troubling even the youngsters brought up in this so-called ideal environment . "
529,"it's a decidedly corny and manipulative coming-of-age film that never quite grabbed my attention , but it was sure pleasant enough in a surface way , telling an old-fashioned story that carefully skirts any controversy . he says he took a job as an accountant so he would be sitting at work and people wouldn't notice that he walks with a limp . the coming-of-age messages in this film are presented in a low-key manner , as they reflect on a number of things seen through the childish eyes of willie , such as the pains of war , the disappointments of hero worship , the importance of friendship and loyalty , the thrill of puppy love , the necessity for community pride , the need for parental love and racial tolerance , and his overall fond memories of childhood . in a formulaic scene using every ounce of its energy to tear at the viewer's heart , skip wakes up after a life-saving operation , as an immense relief comes over the face of willie . the film should be enjoyed by children of all ages , as the dog steals the picture with his antics and spinning tricks and playful ways . adults might be taken in by a sense of nostalgia , about seeing an idealized childhood they might have had or wished for . those who grew up having a dog as a pet , should respond with approval about how much fun it was to have a dog . for the film to be better received , it would have needed more drama . but , as it is , it is good enough as a plain old-fashioned story about the love affair between an introspective youngster and his loving dog . muniz made for an appealing youngster , skip stole every scene he was in , and the understated and elegant performances by both bacon and lane , gave the film some life . if you're in the mood for a lighthearted boy-dog story and are not looking for anything deeper than that , then "" my dog skip "" will jump right up on your lap and lick your face . "
530,"it is a darkly violent film that fails to be dramatically engaging , but has its brief moments of edification as it satisfactorily points out how each side harmed innocent citizens in their fight and what ultimately the union victory meant for the country . but the film could not present a coherent plot , as it seemed to shrivel up as the story dragged on after its colorful battle scenes . taking the southern side , the film found humor in the awkward situations presented and found beauty in the landscape photographed , and reasons in the southern cause which doomed them to failure . but many things about the film seemed to be perfunctory and more like a costume show where the soldiers were more interested in showing off the plumage on their cowboy hats than in giving a dramatic presentation . this explains a key weakness of the southern cause , according to the filmmaker , that the southern values are tradition-bound and part of a static culture . they have been spending their time having longwinded unnatural conversations that sound much like sermons , so sue lee's intrusion is more than welcome at this time . though this is a technically correct and serious movie and tries to cover a controversial topic in an intelligent way , yet the presentation of the story didn't seem to always jell . it was a dull film , the acting was misplaced , the story was too distant and the dialogue was stilted . it never got around to being an entertaining film , and it could never be perceived as just an informative film , because it could never quite spit out what it was trying to say . i also found tobey maguire's performance grimacing to take--this was the wrong part and film for him to go through his innocent contortions that he has done in all his previous films .

531,"david lynch's lost highway , his first feature film after five years , is a surreal thriller with a puzzling plot , that asks a lot from the viewer , as far as accepting this far-fetched tale on face value . it's meant to be a non-conventional film , a shocker , an attempt at post-modern noir , an avant-garde sci-fi ghost story that is stylish and engrossing , but what it mostly is , is a confusing film that tries to be weirder than his eraserhead and blue velvet films , but is too outlandish to be compared with those superior features . it also smacks of being pretentious , of putting down the characters in nonhuman terms , as if they are so unimportant that they can easily be reincarnated to appear as someone else , without any explanation being given . it was a cold story , seemingly with psychological undertones about multiple-personality disorders that stretches logic to the breaking point . but it held my attention throughout and concludes with a roller-coast ride down a dark , desolate highway , with an ending that does little to give meaning to the puzzle . but it does complete its narrative by tieing up the loose ends of what the characters were plotting and it keeps intact its pessimistic mood . it sounded like this is something that could have been said in an adult version of an 'amos and andy' sketch . lynch then goes into exploiting his usual themes of violence , gore and dubious sexual situations and we also get to see arquette stroll around in her underwear , when she's not completely nude . she was the least interesting of all the characters , partly because of her insipid performance and partly because the two characters she played were not particularly interesting . i'm not exactly clear what it means , but a lot of things in this film serve as doubles , including the couple's house which is a double for the lost highway hotel , where some heavy-duty action takes place in the film's concluding moments . both bill pullman and balthazar getty are effective in their roles , as they both seem to be acting in a low-key mode . while the loggia role was too predictably gangsterish and seen too often in recent films to bring much to the table here ( it was second-rate in maniacal comic-viciousness compared to hopper's same type of role in blue velvet ) . the movie was somewhat effective not because of the actors or the story , but because it was elusive , atmospheric , unpredictable , different in form , and gracefully ethereal . it was a film that took chances , resulting in an uneven work , but in its dark moments was able to shine as a haunting film . if one wishes to make sense of this film , it would have to be done on a metaphorical level , and it would take dismissing logic and loving a film that relishes in its darkness and obscurity . "
532,"it is hard for me to believe that one of the world's greatest directors and one of my favorites , paul cox ( lonely hearts/my first wife/man of flowers/cactus/a woman's tale ) , made a film that was so saintly that it seemed to be without dramatic affect or chinks in its pious armor . this is not a commercial film , nor one that tends to compromise its serious tone in order to become more entertaining . it is a true story that tries not to flinch from the suffering it presents and from the altruistic virtues of the dedicated priest who is only interested in comforting those shunned by society because of leprosy . it eschews the tricks of filmmaking in its presentation of such a morbid subject , to its detriment . there is no bend in this film . in this beautifully shot film on the island of kalaupapahe , catching the lushness of the hawaiian islands , cox has taken the subject matter of suffering to a new degree of intensity and requires the viewer to be either fully absorbed in it or else it would be impossible to feel anything about such a miserable topic as 19th century leprosy ( hansen's disease ) . there is medicine for treating leprosy as of 1940 , but the undeveloped countries still can't afford that medicine , so the disease is still around . and as brilliant a study as this is , taking on such a difficult subject , this brilliance fails to amount to anything more than being a history lesson about hawaii and about those banished to die alone from that disease on an abandoned hawaiian island called molokai . he is so touched by this , that the first leper he sees , who is a child , he not only touches but embraces . unfortunately , the storytelling remains flat despite the superb character performance by the australian david wenham . in one scene , the most dramatic one in the film , lepers are tossed off the boat docked on the island's harbor and many of them drown . it is a scene of immense cruelty , but seems to have happened as if it were a dream and not real , as not much is made of it and the film just continues on without giving pause to that event . the film just couldn't say more about the priest except that he made conditions better , converted many to catholicism , and contacted the disease and died , relieved to know that the nuns have come at last and that there is another priest to carry on the work . these are fine accomplishments , but i'm afraid , they are not dramatic enough to energize this film . i felt anguished about all the piety i was seeing , but the film despite all its obvious flaws lingered with me for a long time afterwards and i'm not quite sure why . that is why i liked it better when the film had a chance to sink in , than i did when first watching it . it's a tough film to enjoy and i'm not sure i learned anything about suffering from it , that is if i was supposed to , but i do think i saw someone who i believe is an actual saint , and he was a spellbinding saintly figure despite being so unapproachable . it was the very best thing i have to say about a tedious film that i am glad i saw , even if i was not entertained by it . "
533,"a big , loopy , overlong , dullish docudrama-style thriller , about the losing battle of the 'war on drugs . ' it is at times more preachy than dramatic , taking the point of view that something has to be done about the drug situation but not saying what , only that what's been tried has not worked and the youth of america are being unduly harmed by drugs . there's nothing new presented here : same old answers , same old film , but this one takes itself more serious because of the talented cast and the formulaic way this story was adapted from a simon moore work , which was scripted by stephen gaghan and directed with precision but in an uninspiring way by steven soderbergh . it first ran as a mini-series on british tv in 1989 , a medium it probably would be the most logical place to view this updated ambitious version . once all the stories are in place , the film shows how human frailty plays a part in the corruption of various individuals . manolo succumbs to being bribed by the drug lords as he is overwhelmed by the money he sees passing hands and does something he would never have done , if not tempted . the film wraps up neatly , tieing up all the tragic ongoing drug war stories . so he asks out loud , how can you wage a war against your own family ? the film soft pedals any advocacy for legalizing drugs and offers no hard-hitting critique of current policies , except to say it doesn't work . it seems to have safely placed itself in the middle of the argument , not taking sides ( a rather wishy-washy way to leave things ) . i don't know what could be said , other than this was a competently made film , the actors were forceful in their roles , with the plucky performance by the conflicted cop benicio del toro outshining the others , and for some comic relief , there was some amusing dialogue between cheadle and guzman . the film had a nice look to it , as cinematographer soderbergh aka peter andrews , has given the film a look of urgency , using a handheld camera , and working with different tinctures of desertlike yellow-orange shades and icy blue lighting to get a better view of his subjects and their hard-boiled tale . "
534,"the production also changed screenwriters , as david mamet's script was rejected and his script was replaced by steven zaillian's . the film is stylistically pleasing to the eye . its serial killer scenes are excessive , but they do allow for comedy to soften the blows and , also , since all the victims were not particularly nice people , watching them being mutilated was made more bearable . the film can be divided into three parts and all with different results . the film's opening is meticulously choreographed , showing in detail how a police bust can go sour . the film's second part taking place in italy , is brilliantly conceived and acted , it is the heart of the film , with its visual effects matching its dialogue and storytelling . though , even this part of the film has its faults , as some scenes will drag on for far too long , allowing a tedium to creep into the story . the last part , when back in the washington , dc area , is a total gross-out , that brings the film down to a mundane campy level , as bad taste takes over , making for a very sloppy and exploitive surprise ending . overall , this sequel didn't live up to the high-pulp-art standards of the original , but it was still successful in being a technically superior cinematic happening and the quality of the acting was always first-rate . hopkins's riveting performance is interlaced with wit and a sense of the genteel , though it also comes with some over-the-top moves ( though there are no slurping tongue sounds when he goes into his cannibalistic mode as in the original ) . the nervous , icy but vulnerable persona that moore ably brought to her role , much like foster played it , keyed in on her fight with male authority figures who can't accept her because she's different than they are , more than with her mental chess game with lecter as in the original . in the climactic scenes , hannibal comes back to the states , and his long-anticipated meeting with clarice takes place -- which turns out to be a fizzle , or a real lame-brained idea on how to put a twist in the plot that becomes unnecessarily twisted . the film , that was faithful to thomas harris' novel until this point , now goes off on ridley scott's own direction and it becomes an absurd mess , with nothing working right , and all its good work is nearly eaten away by the director's bad instincts . what can you say , but sometimes you try something new and it just doesn't taste right . "
535,"a slight melodramatic story , but an efficiently made moral tale with noir overtures . this film does a good job of poking holes at that dream , showing underneath the surface all is not well . but the nightmare indicates more than that , as it indicates there is something troubling even the youngsters brought up in this so-called ideal materialistic environment . "
536,"this theme has been done better many times before and in a superior way in such films as "" shane ( 53 ) "" and in clint's own "" high plains drifter ( 72 ) . "" this film adds little to the genre , except it is a visually stunning film as photographed by bruce surtees and clint's heroics are enjoyable to watch , as he unabashedly brings back many of the western's classic confrontational scenes , such as the showdown on main street and of the helpless man made to dance as the gunslingers fire away at his feet . otherwise , this is a somewhat disappointing venture , not because it isn't well-acted or directed , but because it is so stale that it becomes uninvolving . they are a rough looking bunch of desperadoes , all wearing long dusters , giving the final shootout , a very recognizable western touch . it's a fine film for those who don't mind that hero-worshipping is a good chunk of the plot , and that what was metaphorically hinted at never develops because of the film's awkward presentation . "
537,"it was crisply directed and well acted , and its quick pace fitted nicely into the stylish way this b & w film was presented . "
538,"one character says of the farm , it is in such a remote spot , even the coyotes don't come here . it's a marriage consumed by hate . "" deep valley "" offers a dramatic look at how love can make one feel alive again . the film comes to a boil with its very moving conclusion , after a very slow start . the acting is first-rate , making these melodramatics seem realistic . "
539,"zhang yang's bittersweet dramatic comedy , "" shower , "" is meant to be a crowd pleaser . its manipulative and sugary story is set in modern beijing . why he didn't phone is a mystery to me , since he doesn't seem to go anywhere without his cell phone . the film's more serious message , is of the family's estranged relationship . the director zhang yang has created a graceful , masculine film ( all the main characters are male and the story is told from their view ) , avoiding for the most part the sentimentality that could have sunk the film , if handled by a lesser director . this mainstream , middle-brow , foreign film was the winner of audience awards at festivals at rotterdam and all over europe and asia , which means it clicked with varous audiences because of its universal appeal . though , i thought , to make his point about the old and new china , he pulled out too many old contrived tricks out of the hat , from the bathhouse being torn down and replaced by a shopping mall , to a retarded brother stealing the film with his comical and good-natured appeal . yet what i found to be outright fascinating , was the strong relationship between the wonderfully benevolent zhu xu ( the king of masks ) , an actor who has a certain magical screen presence , and the gifted actor who played his retarded son , jiang wu , and the equally gifted actor pu cun xin who as the older son , was used by the director to signify how well the transition was going in china from the old to the new . but what interested me most about shower , is that it gave me a chance to observe everyday life in a country that has been closed to the west , and the film has done it in a most endearing way . other than that , i still found the story too sweet for my taste . "
540,"and , even though , he is told that the hamam is now out of fashion and the one he has inherited needs lots of repairs , he decides to remain and restore it to its traditional beauty . it was a strange emotional love affair that this film offers its protagonists -- a love affair with a city rather than with another . the film presents a lesson on the old and new cultures of both italy and turkey . but for a film about passion , this one was very reserved , showing no nudity or sensual scenes , in fact very little passion . "
541,"a fairly routine contemporary western , which was originally shot in 3-d , but was later re-released without that gimmick . if you ever wanted to see both a rodeo and a movie together , now is your chance . under richard fleischer's capable direction , the film does a marvelous job of capturing the realistic flavor of being around rodeo performers . but the love story is rather sappy , and the point about how dangerous the rodeo is , especially for those who get older and can't stop performing , seemed too melodramatic . nevertheless , the film thrived on the very good performances by gig young and the supporting cast , especially by harry morgan . it was able to film an entire rodeo event in tuscon , arizona , in almost real time . it is basically a soap-opera version of nicholas ray's much superior "" the lusty men "" ( 1952 ) . there is good comraderie among the riders , featuring friendly rivalries , but there are also occasions for spats . "
542,"it plays more like a theatrical ghost story or a greek tragedy than a western . tantoo cardinal has a minor part , even though the film is theoretically about her , as the film's title states . it's a film that revels in a dark brooding mystical flavor and of being a revisionist-type of a western rather than one of those traditional oaters . unfortunately , the film never held together in a cohesive way , and seemed forced and awkward at times . it should satisfy mostly those who are in need to see something different , something that is cultish and attuned to sam shephard's penchant for showing dysfunctional families . "
543,"naturally , coming from them , it is a very loose interpretation of that greek classic . this film even gets its title from the part in sullivan's travels when joel mccrea , playing a successful director , wants to stop doing comedy to make instead a serious socially conscious drama called `o brother , where art thou ? ' the film will display moments of visual splendor and a riot of comedy coming about through the characterization of the three stooge-like convicts , but overall the film flags in its effort to make the story more worthy than a few skits that work . the major skit in the film , is a wonderfully choreographed ku klux klan rally that is disrupted by the boys in a comical fashion . the film reaches its climactic moment , when they sing in disguise at a political rally and get recognized with a standing ovation by the audience as the soggy bottom boys . the story seemed to die when it tried to conclude in some sane way , as the film was played mostly for the comedy , so the story had no emotional impact or little complexity to it , even though it lightly touched on racial and religious issues . there were also several obvious references to homer's epic , but mostly it was a film carried by the comedy performances of the three dimwitted characters , with george clooney showing he had an old-fashioned charm , much like the old hollywood stars , plus he has a good ear for comedy , and showed that he could carry a film . i was somewhat disappointed by this big mess of a film ( trying to depict the depression-era in the deep south as in the midst of great social changes due to anything from its music to the tva--with comedy being prescribed as a the cureall for everything ) . it was amusing and fun to watch , but could never get over its limitation -- a weak storyline . "
544,"it's a colorful adventure story of saloon brawls , romance , and corruption . the brawl was unrealistic but marvelous to watch . the stellar cast of stars and noted supporting players keep the action rolling , as everyone seems just right for the parts they are playing . marlene couldn't be sexier , wearing brocades and gowns , changing from one gown to another at the drop of a beer stein . for comic moments , there is the dialogue between marlene and black maid marietta canty , who is yearning for a black dude to appear in the yukon . "
545,"a nice premise about the 4th dimension results in an exciting low-budget pulp sci-fi film , which is supported by some fine acting by robert lansing and lee meriwether that gave the film some tension , the only spoiler was some incredulous acting by james congdon , putting a bit of a damper on the film . this b-film also look stilted at times , but was able to go forward with a riveting story and overcome its shortcomings and lackluster special effects ( except for the thrilling walk through the wall ) . as far as i know , there were no winners , but it was fun to see the way some film moguls promoted their films back then . it seems that a year's worth of energy takes place in a second and gives scott this superpower . the crudest line of dialogue in this hokum sci-fier , is a question asked by meriwether to lansing : do you want to be remembered as a creator or a killer ? "
546,"guy ritchie has cleaned up some of the mess he made in this encore to his surprise box-office cult hit "" lock , stock and two smoking barrels , "" but has made the same kind of empty , semiserious/comedy/crime caper , with many of the same actors from that film . but , this time the story holds together better and is much more amusing , thanks in a large part to the ensemble cast who come and go in the film with seamless fluidity . it's a film filled with an assortment of colorful runyonesque characters from the underworld of crime , or illegal bare-knuckle boxing matches , or from the outcasts of society . this film , like the director's other one , has no strong role for a woman . the main plot is about a series of mishaps over a stolen diamond that somehow brings together a varied mix of characters who are after it or are inadvertently drawn into its disappearance , but the plot is really irrelevant , it plays as a mcguffin--this is strictly a character driven film , with all the characters being either lively in a cartoonish way , undeveloped , or forgettable . the movie will spin-off in different directions , telling each groups' story , until it all comes together in the last reel and plays itself out . the film is played mostly for the comedy and it throws everything it thinks is crazy into the comic mix , even a shaggy dog story . the language used has many expletives and is often hard to understand because of the heavy accents . the violence is brutal but cartoonish , as the film is styled much like a comic book . the rest of this heavily induced homage to musical video films , has a soundtrack that ranges from massive attack to oasis . ford's menacing psychotic performance , stood out as the film's most memorable one . pitt's self-effacing comedy was the performance i best enjoyed , as it gave the film a sparkling light touch ; while , dennis farina , also , was pleasingly comical and added some light touches to this cartoonish film . the only slow down in the film is in the opening moments , when the large cast of characters is introduced . other than that , the film moves at high speed , with all kinds of film gimmicks , from jump cuts to multi use of graphics . this is a film that thrives on controlled chaos as its signature theme . i would call it another dumb cult picture the director has made , one that suffers because there is no one in this film to care about . "
547,"the film brings up a few interesting points about defending such an unappealing man and how legitimate is the insane plea , which if allowed to be used as a plea could really bog down the justice system with criminals trying to manipulate the system . the filmmaker probably didn't feel confident enough with kensington's testimony in favor of insanity and had winston put on a show for the court to prove he was really nuts . the film for all its soft spots , still had a good but enigmatic performance from mitchum , whose motives for taking on the army bigwigs and putting a dent in his career are never made quite clear . keenan wynn was an appealing loony . the film was interesting enough in spots to hold my attention , but it defeated its own purpose by making general kempton so politically immoral and wynn so nutty , that the film's liberal message can only be viewed as a muddled one . "
548,"the opening battle scene is chaotic and bloody that begs for comparison with the realistic way "" saving private ryan "" opened its film . this old-fashioned type of hokey heroic war film , which since the vietnam war has been out of fashion , should be praised for its realistic gory opening battle scene and for its hollywoodish personal gun duel at the end , which was as thrilling as the one in "" high noon . "" the problem with this supposedly true story about a genuine russian hero , was that the long middle part was bogged down by an unmoving love triangle and a lot of empty political rhethoric that slowed down the action and took away from the suspense of the two snipers matching wits with each other . it also took away credibility from the overall truth of this real war story . but it is this love triangle that saps away from what the film was about , which even more than the war story itself , is about two men trying to see who is better at what they do . this could have just as easily have been the theme for a sports film , therefore the politics feels superfluous . the trouble with the film , is that it didn't work well for stretches that were too long , and the only performance i found interesting was ed harris's . jude law played his role like a matinee idol in the old days of hollywood war films would , which was to look good under all the war grime and be the good-hearted hero without a flaw . his performance did not hinder the film , but on the other hand , it didn't seem special to me . but the performance i found the most wanting , was joseph fiennes's , which i found belabored with muddled marxist speeches that made no sense . in fact , his role never added up , as i have no idea what he was supposed to symbolize . if he stops believing in the marxist cause because a girl rejects him as is indicated in the film , then he has to be a more shallow character than the director intended him to be . his performance woes could be blamed entirely on an inadequate script . "
549,"it is a biopic that is brutally honest about the exiled writer as an opponent of castro's , one that lets us see that liberation to him was not only a matter of politics but of the freedom to be a homosexual and an artist , something which the castro regime couldn't agree with and came down harshly on both homosexuals and artists , by sending them to prison camps . his happiest moments in childhood seemed to be watching the nude men bathing and those moments connected with nature , such as his love for the landscape and the ocean . spanish actor javier bardem portrays arenas ( someone he closely resembles ) with great sexuality , perception and feeling , giving a virtuoso performance . castro will allow for no artistic freedom or homosexual activity , which he labels counterrevolutionary . julian schnabel has created an emotionally penetrating look at a man living with his alienation in a marginalized existence and using that bitter experience as a source of energy for his writing . this beautifully photographed film , which looks much like a series of paintings on canvas , might be too bleak for a general audience , but it paints a more realistic political view of castro's cuba than most of the recent films i have seen about this subject , and should be of special interests to those of all persuasions who care about freedom and the arts . "
550,"it results in laughs that are engineered from the lowest common denominator of comedy . but the good news is , that there are laughs to be had , if you are willing to bite into the over-the-top performances , the unseamly sight gags , and absurd plot . the bad news is , the film is sympathetic to these revolting hustlers and the film's amoral theme is hard to justify , except to say that this is just a cartoon for adults . it also begins to drag , as the premise grows weary from overkill . "" heartbreakers "" is a forgettable fluff film , that tries unsuccessfully to work its way to romance and also be a caper flick . it works best when showing off the boobs of weaver and hewitt , who are outfitted in dresses sluts would wear to walk the streets , as the film proudly relies on the old adage , that sex sells . there were a number of funny bits , and they came from hackman's w . c . fields-like performance , calling out for the love of smoking and preaching its virtues , even encouraging children to take up smoking . what the comedy had going for it , was a lot of spunk , enough to overlook the film's many drawbacks . "
551,"anthony mann is a master at directing these cheapie films and making them look stylish . he gets the most out of this thin story because of the complementary performances of raymond burr and steve brodie . violence and desperation are the themes of this noir film . if examined closely , there are many holes in the story , but what works very effectively is how the film shows that middle-class aspirations for the postwar period are tinged with cynicism . it's shown how there's a sense of brutality that fills the everyday american social scene . the paranoid couple feels the urgency to look out for themselves , not trusting anyone else to help them . this feeling of hopelessness the couple has , gives this film its classic noir look . "
552,"the mystical theme of evil was never fully developed , but the film was well photographed and acted , and the story was very creepy . there were many odd touches that worked very well , that director freddie francis added to this original screenplay by jonathan rumbold & peter spenceley . there's also a surprise ending that fits in well with the film's theme of man's inhumanity . it makes for an above-average horror flick , one that horror fans in particular might enjoy more than others . "
553,"a minimal story that is too thin for a feature film . it is about urban deterioration and alienation in taiwan as seen just seven days before 2000 and leading up to the 'new millennium . ' it makes one act like a bug , crawling on all fours and so on , as the victim first shows flu-like symptoms . at the 1998 cannes film festival , this taiwanese-french drama won a fipresci award , given by international critics . what i liked best about it were the half dozen musical numbers sung by grace chang , as the two tenants lip-synch and dance along to the tunes . the film would be interrupted by the fantasy scenes , where the dressed-up protagonists would go into their lively cabaret-like song and dance routine . some of the lively songs to counter the non-action scenes were : 'oh calypso , ' 'go away don't come back , ' 'i want you to-what i want is your love , ' 'gesundheit , ' and 'i don't care who you are . ' this film was initiated as part of the french tv series of one-hour end-of-millennium dramas . its appeal will probably be most appreciated by the music lovers of those old hong kong films ( grace chang was a popular singer in the china of the 1950s ) , and those admirers of french directors rivette and demy , whose musicals are also followed by strange stories and a dead-pan humor . it also should appeal to those who want to see the unusual , and their reward might be that this is a film that makes them think they have something to think about . for me , nothing much happened in this intriguing kafka-like idea for a film to rise above its leaky promises . it needed more of a story and protagonists with more personality , in order for it to feel more alive . "
554,"a solid action thriller directed by alfred hitchcock . but it has many plot flaws and suffers from poor pacing and can best be perceived as a precursor to his much improved other 'framed innocent man pic , ' north by northwest . the film draws to an action conclusion , with barry and fry mixing it up on the statue . the film can be forgiven for its many patriotic speeches extolling the virtues of america , since there was a war taking place . but it can't be forgiven for how shoddy the story line was and how you can just about challenge every scene in this film as being fake . when the nazi ring gets cummings in nyc , there's no way they would handle him so casually , making his escape seem so easy , as they didn't even tie him up . when taken to nyc by baxter , a call would have been placed to kruger exposing cummings , which for some unexplained reason wasn't done . the other major flaw was that cummings and lane were much too bland to give this story personality . hitch's first choices of gary cooper and barbara stanwyck would have made the film that much more charismatic , though cummings and lane were not that bad as much as they were colorless . "
555,"a funny spoof on hollywood , scripted by and starring steve martin . "" we've got to get a crew , and i want the best damn crew we can afford ! "" he has given kit three rules to live by : "" there are no aliens , "" "" there is no giant foot trying to squash me , "" and "" i feel like i might ignite , but probably i won't . "" he is further told , k . . . i . . . t stands for 'keep it together , ' which means keep mr . weenie in the pants . bowfinger assures her that this is the way kit likes to work , it's 'cinema nouveau . ' this movie about making a movie has the hollywood phony la-la scene down pat and under frank oz's sharp direction , the film gets all the laughs it can from its very funny satirical premise . martin and murphy were never funnier , and the supporting cast adds just the right ingredients to the comedy presentation . even though most of the film does work , some of the comedy routines became tiresome as the film progressed but not enough to spoil the lighthearted fun . "
556,"a good joel mccrea flick . it is suspenseful , entertaining , fast-paced , and tautly scripted by eric ambler from a novel by geoffrey household . "
557,"it was a hit at the 1998 afi filmfest . wade didn't see what happened and he doesn't know if he should believe jane , but he doesn't like her solution to the problem and the two of them show that they are cut from a different cloth . the film has the minimal amount of dialogue and holds our attention because the protagonist is a good guy , who ironically can only find freedom when he's in a real prison . the film's main flaw , is that it proves its point by wrapping things up with too nice of a pink bow tied around it . "
558,"this bizarre supernatural art-horror film is the first feature with all dialogue recorded in esperanto ( an artificial international language created in the 1800s so everyone in the world could speak in the same tongue ) . there are english subtitles . it's a gorgeously photographed b/w film by cinematographer conrad hall ; a spooky tale about murderous sea creatures . it's filled with hokum , as it tells about the battle for souls between the god of light and the god of darkness . guess who wins ? this thin story has merit , as it casts a spellbinding effect over its eerie doings and strange surroundings . if its strangeness you are seeking , or a cultish horror film from the 1960s that is an oddity , or if you are a fan of horror films , then this is the film for you . others might not be so taken with the strange events taking place , events that seem more nutty than real ; and , they might not be taken by shatner's stiff performance . i found this b film engaging in an ingmar bergman way , but without the swedish director's ability to tell a better story . but , the film deserves an audience beyond its cultish fans .

559,"it's a gritty cop movie when the two protagonists are inarticulate and are trying to form a relationship to ease their inner pain . their romance is quirky and seems to be stumbling around to get someplace . unfortunately , when they do become articulate and mesh together , the film moves into the predictable formulaic mold and ends in a cornball way . her physical prowess in that incident would make make even the most macho policeman feel proud . even though catch seems like a freak show , sharon feels something about him that she doesn't from the other guys she goes out with . as for their hot moments together jlo is a natural for sex , but caviezel seemed too distant to really be getting into it . but the film can almost be forgiven for its sore points in storytelling , because these two star performers bring something to the screen that is curiously arresting . the problem with the film is that the filmmaker couldn't let their romance play out in a natural way . to make matters seem more artificial there is some loud , syrupy music before the film ends and the credits roll by , as jlo and caviezel drive off together seemingly having survived their personal tragedies with some big fake smiles on their faces . i wonder how many market research reports it took for them to come up with that happy ending ! "
560,"the film's poetic title can be explained as follows : that the sun always sets instead of rises during the day of an execution . they are more interested to see how the chair works than in anything else . the jury didn't believe the 'ghost story' he told . but 46 says he can't be fooled , he would know his gestures anywhere . the story was well told , but the acting left a lot to be desired . and all that religious stuff thrown in , about how god listens to you , was strictly cornball . but as far as b-films go , this one is above average . "
561,"strange bargain ( director : will price ; screenwriters : from a story j . h . a well-conceived mystery b-film , but strictly second feature material . "
562,"the film takes us into territory film's rarely traverse . it crosses the emotional boundaries of a forbidden love . timing , which is a key to all romances blooming , is just right here . on the island , we see them kiss and are not made aware if anything more intimate took place . the film asks the question about what makes us love someone . mom's ideal is hardly less childish which is the point varda is making , the ideal mate sought is all about one's feelings and they are irrational . this is a suggestive film , touching a tabu subject , but it handles it delicately with an unflinching directness . this affair is viewed with the same frankness varda thinks we should view all things in life . the current aids epidemic must be faced with humor and real knowledge , or else ignorance about it will cause more damage than good . this film did not exploit an exploitive situation , and it provided much fuel for thought . "
563,"the plot is pure film noir , but the film's production values are even cheaper than the usual noir film . it is shot in a dull , shadowless manner and the performers seem to be lifeless except for milburn stone , who shines in a rare starring role for him . but it comes too late for anderson , who committed suicide just a little earlier . the plot was too convoluted to give the film credibility . but the film's premise was still interesting enough . "
564,"the energy and vitality of these musical scores and a host of bizarrely dressed supporting performers who fill the stage with song and dance , gives this film a comical circus flavoring , which manages to cover-up its clich ? -ridden story as much as possible . it's directed with an eye for color , especially the color of rouge , by the pop-musical enthusiast , the australian , baz luhrmann ( "" romeo and juliet "" / "" strictly ballroom "" ) , an mtv type of director , who is more interested at getting at what dazzles than the why of the dazzle . the film is a series of perpetual motion shots , never pausing to delve into any character study . the problem with that , is you don't really care what happens to the lovers . the spectacle of the film is the only substance offered , and its made sumptuously beautiful for the eye to feast on . what excuses this film from being such a rip-off of other films , is that what is stolen from other films works very well here . it gives the film all the breathless moments found in other films a chance to breath again in this whirlwind of a production that is in a constant climax mode . if all it took was energy and beautiful sets and costumes , then this production would be a glorious one ; but , what this film didn't have was a love story that could touch the heart , even as it screamed out that it was all about heart . this is an easy movie to praise for being inventive and diverting , but it cannot be admired for a film that has a semblance of truth about it . it's just another enjoyable but forgettable hollywood musical , in a long chorus line of such ventures . the film has the feel in all its excesses of a ken russell type of musical crossed with any number of hollywood ones , even such an illustrious traditional one as "" singing in the rain . "" the wealthy duke is the heavy in this film . he is played by richard roxburgh , who plays the one-dimensional role as tritely as it is written . the film's gimmick is having 20th century musical songs and routines , that are eye popping , fill this 19th century set musical . they range from songs such as : "" the sound of music , "" "" your song , "" "" diamonds are a girl's best friend , "" "" material girl , "" "" smells like teen spirit , "" "" like a virgin , "" "" lady marmalade , "" "" silly love songs , "" "" all you need is love , "" "" up where we belong , "" "" don't leave me this way , "" "" heroes , "" "" in the name of love , "" and "" roxanne . "" this is just a partial list of songs , as the stage is always tuned for some song and dance action . all the main characters played are the usual stock archetypes--nicole kidman was eye catching as the nightclub star and courtesan who is really a sweetie for a whore , but she was too physically big to be handled in a believable way by ewan mcgregor . i was amused by john leguizamo as the rascal-like toulouse-lautrec , and jim broadbent was overpowering in his role as ringmaster of this operation . he seems to be much too stagy a thespian for these more profane hollywood actors he's surrounded by , as he stood out from them because either he was a much better actor than they were or because he hammed it up too much . in any case , his performance did stick out like someone who is thumbing a ride back to topsy-turvy . yet i felt myself partial to his performance , as in every scene he was in i couldn't help being overwhelmed by his strong presence ; though , kidman's performance was the key one of the film . she handles her part in an admirable way , showing us a lot of leg and feeling for who she was ; but , the love story had no sparks and just didn't work right . it's a film that looked good ( lots of garish colors and stardust ) , sounded fine , and felt so-so . a great escape film in the tradition of hollywood spectacles , a film that does justice to the cancan dancers of the moulin rouge . it's a fun film to let one's hair down , to sit leisurely back with some popcorn and watch this film speed across the screen ; while , from time to time peeking in on the jewel-encrusted elephant that goes for satine's boudoir , or checking in on mcgregor's impoverished artist's digs as he slaves over the typewriter with an outside neon sign shining throughout the night ( speaking of clich ? s ) . "
565,"director claude chabrol has come up with a diverting thriller , that is well-crafted and features a magnificent performance by philippe noiret as christian legagneur . what was missing in this better-than-average thriller , was a sense of passion . everything seemed to be happening in a too matter-of-fact manner . "
566,"old-fashioned way , the ( director : william beaudine ; screenwriters : from a story by charles bogle [w . c . fields]/jack cunningham/garnett weston ; cinematographer : benjamin f . reynolds ; cast : w . c . a joyous w . c . it's a different version from the silent screen one that bombed , as here fields is allowed to ad lib and do his thing . fields is in fine comic form here , even doing a ridiculous juggling act with a cigar-box . "
567,"he replaced the deceased warner oland , and plays chan in a more avuncular style . this film comes at the onset of ww 11 and therefore has a patriotic theme , which is well-crafted into the sabotage story so as not to seem misplaced storytelling . "" one enemy is one too many . "" the best part of this enjoyable whodunit , was that it was hard to guess who ryner was . "
568,"he was replaced in the film by wheeler oakman , who doesn't have much of a part . the story was a conventional hero against villain one , but the film had a certain splendor about it that elevated its melodramatics . "
569,"mildred pierce is a noir melodrama that served as a comeback film for waning star joan crawford , who was recently dumped by mgm . the film was nominated for 6 oscars , and joan won the best actress award . she certainly had a reason to . but this kid is so rotten and has such a vile mouth , that it's impossible to believe that her mother could still like her so much . the acting and cinematography and curtiz's directing were fine . the story didn't make too much sense , but it was lively . blyth is over-the-top bitchy in her femme fatale role . but the noir film also is intent on making the point , how difficult it is for a woman on her own to make it in a patriarchal society . "
570,"a thoughtless formula movie about street racers , that moves so fast from one scene to the next it could be geared for those who suffer from add ( attention defecit disorder ) ; it should give you a few jolts and cinematic thrills , but the price paid is that logic is the first thing thrown out of the car window . the theme of this summertime movie could be that there's little difference in morality between criminals and undercover cops , and that's probably giving the film too much credit for thinking about anything but the box office . it's all about racing cars that seem like rockets when equipped with nitrous oxide ; it's the driving scenes that keep you from nodding off and since they use real cars , with real stunt riders , that's what grabs your attention throughout and makes you a captive of this meaningless but childishly fun tale . the film's best attempt at dialogue goes something like this . . . first place racer ( diesel ) : "" it don't matter if you win by an inch or by a mile ; winning's winning . "" but if you don't mind being taken for a mindless adrenaline ride across the glittering blacktops of los angeles , this could be excused as a guilty pleasure treat . this was exciting but meaningless stuff ; there was no artistic accomplishment derived from this by-the-numbers action pic . the acting can't be faulted , but it was left on the skidmarks on the road , as this script was too inane to provide any realistic characterizations . the two women had badly underwritten parts , walker was forgettable in his role , and diesel was all high-octane energy , acting either angry or looking tough with his shaved head while constantly flexing his musles . he gave this film whatever acting charisma it had to have , so at least one human could look as good as the cars . this was the kind of film where you could have walked in for the last 15 minutes and would have had no trouble following the story . it's one of those bad flicks that is irresistible because there's a charge to it that rides through its mundane story and allows it to almost get away with its ludcricous dialogue . the dialogue that made me crack my biggest smile went like this -- dom to brian : "" i live my life a quarter-mile at a time , for those 10 seconds , i'm free . "" if you are looking for a film about reality or one that has a philosophy , or one that just makes sense , i would avoid this one . but if you want to see a film about people whom you probably wouldn't like if you met them on the road in real-life , but on film you can be tolerant of them and even might find this film oddly enjoyable , then this popcorn movie might taste buttery to you . it has those other recent car movies , driven , gone in sixty seconds , and grand theft auto , beat by a city mile . "
571,"an atmospheric and most entertaining charlie chan episode . it was the longest charlie chan made at 79 minutes and it was the first one not based on an earl derr biggers book . this film was more a case of charlie chan in the english countryside than in london , but why quibble over a title when the story was so entertaining ! "
572,"nobody does an adultery film quite the way the french do it . this melodrama is no exception . the co-director g ? rard depardieu is also one of the film's stars , and does a credible job in both roles . there's nothing much to do in town , so mina is a frequent movie-goer . films give her a chance to escape reality , as she excitedly tells tommy : "" good movies make me feel good . "" he feels it's a slap in his face . the film builds to its climax as mina's passion , onced opened up , can't be stopped . it is intelligently handled , but somehow i did not find the film compelling . perhaps it was because georges was painted as a dull man whose strength was in his hands and in his decency , but who had no interest in fantasy . in the last scene at the gas station , a bad imitation of the scene jacques demy brilliantly did in the umbrellas of cherbourg , georges and mina meet while filling up and are going off in different directions . the scene had no real feeling to it , as it felt forced . it seemed to crudely hammer out its point that adultery is a way of escaping a boring marriage , and it seemed more interested in wrapping up the film than in engaging the story with more life . the film looks at this adultery from the view of the woman , which makes it different from the way most films are done . it takes no stand on the adultery , but what it does very well is catch the subtleties and complications that occur in a very believable way . there is a lot of hurt to go around , which makes it a bittersweet love story . the film is set in the normandy region of the 1960s ; it might not seem as relevant today , as its old-fashioned story and french new wave flavor of the 1960s loses a lot of the psychological impact for today's viewers . what it savors , is the subtle performances of bouquet , depardieu , and berling . though , without the middle-aged carole bouquet's touching characterization , this would have been an impossible bridge to cross . "
573,"the acting was good , the suspects did a fine job of not letting on who was the guilty one , there was a good comedy routine between the wise guy sheriff and the wise man oriental sleuth , and the story was well-crafted . this was an above-average one in the series . "
574,"it starts off with some whistling and a monologue by the unseen whistler , just as it was done on radio : "" i am the whistler . . . and i know many things , for i walk by night . "" what it will be . the whistler states at the end : "" i know because i am the whistler . "" the result is an entertaining b film . "
575,"the film becomes a strong love story , rather than an attempt to do a bio on joyce . trieste plays a more important part in this film than does dublin , probably because modern dublin is entirely different from the one joyce knew . that this film is the anti-tourist look at him , one that shows his darker nature and of how jealous and maddening he could be about sex , is a credit to the direction it was aimed at . nevertheless , the film is still a conventional one . the storytelling was of the old-fashioned kind , which in this case works as a detriment to the film . too many situations of the artist complaining the way they do in formula films of this genre exists , such as when joyce complains : 'no one understands me . ' because of its pedestrian approach to the artist , trying to get to him through seeing how nora viewed him , it failed to peel away the many layers of this very complicated genius ; and , it failed to make the story a compelling one . at times it felt like a soap opera rather than drama . what i learned from the film , that wasn't common knowledge before , was more about nora than i did about joyce . this is basically her film and her story . the main actors were engaging . susan lynch is a bold and daring nora , with a quick uncouth wit and a sometimes long face which changes when she smiles and shows how earthy she can be . the problem with all the stylized intelligence the film brought , which is a fine achievement , is that it always appears strained and never carefree . it looks like an art-house film that can't get out of the strait-jacket it placed itself in . "
576,"there will be lots of titty shots and shots from her waist down . but he's much smoother than the bimbo girls and shows them his phony id card while smooth talking them . the problem with this slickly done film , is that everything is only surface deep . we never read the terrorist's mind or get to know much about him or why he does what he does . this is strictly an in-your-face film experience , as the director uribe keeps it at a sensual level and never probes for a possibly deeper story . what this does , is make it a film that was diverting because of the nuanced performances by g ? mez and gabriel . a forgettable film but , nevertheless , an enjoyable one to see . "
577,"the poverty row studio monogram pictures picked the series up for the remaining episodes and the quality diminished . the film has many plot twists and the usual chan setup for the mystery story to unfold . but the story is far-fetched and tries too hard to be mysterious , which causes it to falter in credibility . but the desert atmosphere of the 16th-century castle , the usual comic antics of number two son , and all the suspects moving cautiously around the dark corners of the castle , should please charlie chan fans and give them their usual thrills . "
578,"an above-average entry into the charlie chan series . this version is a remake of the 1931 fox release "" charlie chan carries on , "" a film that no longer exists . he says , "" it's a bitter challenge to me . "" what made this chan adventure fun was that the many characters in it were easy to know , and it was a difficult case to solve . "
579,"japanese auteur , beat takeshi kitano ( sonatine/hana-bi ) , one of the more provocative living directors , continues to make unusual films that are difficult to categorize . this one veers away from his usual violent ones and is a more conventional bittersweet road comedy film , but it is also a very strange film , with many odd slapstick touches to it and many experimental shots of weird images and uncalled for dream sequences . he plays the lead character kikujiro , a seedy , low-level ex-yakuza who is gruff , sentimental , bumbling , and profane . the movie seems to be about outsiders confronting the middle-class . it divides its sections like a child's photo album , as each episode is about how he spent his summer . it has titles like : "" the octopus man . "" there's also no more school activities like soccer practice . there is a madcap comedy scene of mister not knowing how to swim and nearly drowning . the film feels very sentimental , but scenes change moods with the drop of hat and it's not that easy to predict what comes next even though it looks in many ways like one of those familiar road pics about a mismatched innocent kid and an adult who's rough on the exterior but really cares inside . in the end i don't know exactly what this deliberately paced film , which seems too long at two hours , is trying to say or what it accomplishes ( which is not a negative comment , but rather reflects that the director succeeded in making his own kind of film ) . the only thing that made sense to me in a positive way , was that they were both outsiders and the filmmaker is saying it will be tough for someone to make it in japanese society unless they are disciplined and pursue from an early age what they want . the kid at this early age will have to reconcile that granny will raise him , and that her advice is to study hard in school never sounded more conventional but nevertheless seemed to be sound advice . what the kid learned from mister , is that there's a wrong way and right way to do things . the kid had one of those unforgettable summer vacations that put a little fun into his sad life . i wasn't won over by this film , it doesn't seem like the type of film kitano should be making , but it has a strange quality about it that somehow appeals to me because there's an edginess to it around its carefully manicured sentimentality . it also seemed to have its heart in the right place , as kitano has said his own father was an inspiration for the way he played the title character . there was a grimness to this film that its physical humor couldn't hide . "
580,"but if the plot was silly , the fun in this charlie chan story was in watching number one son ( keye luke ) run around like a chicken without a head , seeing charlie overcome being shot in the leg and being kidnapped , and how the film captured the racetrack atmosphere . it makes for a satifactory but not an always well-developed mystery film . "
581,"this charlie chan episode lacked humor , as there was no number one son present . but despite being a bit dry , it applied the usual formula methods and proved to be entertaining . "
582,"a gritty , realistic look at life in the black ghetto . the film is flawed by the obviousness of the situation it shows , yet despite these flaws there is a power in seeing how real these people are . there was no new ground broken , but it did hit a nerve as to what life in a housing project looks like . the film has a powerful opening , which sets the stage for its tragic tale . the film works because it had an honest energy to it , though when it tries to say something meaningful it feels like so much jive . the triteness and predictability of the story prevents the film from traveling too far from the reality of the housing projects the filmmaker knows . the film can't penetrate any further than some surface responses . it's a cautionary inner-city film that should well serve the youthful urban audience that will be most attracted to its story and should relate to them better than it would to a wide audience . "
583,"a classy western filmed on a low-budget . this is a very pleasant western drama about those who are very good opposing those who are rotten . it's a film with good family values , and it's done in a very satisfying way . it makes the most out of its human interest story , as the script by dan ullman slowly builds up to its climactic action scene . joel mccrea gives an outstanding performance as a moral person , who must do what is right even if it means placing himself in danger . "
584,"an entertaining mystery filmed from the back lot of mgm , though it convincingly looks like foggy london . the only thing that is found inside is a note in red chalk saying : pay or be seen no more ! it was strictly lightweight fare , done in a breezy style , but it proved to be an enjoyable b-film . "
585,"it doesn't make too much political sense and it glorifies the nazi police force of berlin in a revolting manner , but it's a snappy film and quite entertaining . the disclosing of the one masterminding this scheme adds the final surprise to this film that is full of plot twists . "
586,"it's set on the lower east side of manhattan , with its abandoned buildings and shabby tenements , which gives it the look of a war-torn city . she's as loopy as one can be . jarmusch is one of america's most talented independent directors , who continues to make original films . this is his humble beginning in films , and the result is a well-crafted technical accomplishment with flashes showing of his great ability to tell a story . permanent vacation is not for the casual filmgoer , but for one who can appreciate an independent way of looking at film . "
587,"edward dmytryk was a victim of the hollywood blacklist , here he returns after a few years in exile to make a stanley kramer produced message drama shot in a realistic style . the film makes good use of the san francisco streets to tell its serial-killer psycho story . the film's message was not that well received , but the suspense of tracking down the nondescript psycho had a good touch to it . the film was a blend of film noir and social drama , pointing out the urban problems of alienation and the public's indifference to those who are mentally unbalanced . "
588,"sternberg had a different vision for the film and after the opening chaotic scenes were told like a straight crime story , the director changed the reality of the silent film and abandoned hecht's version . sternberg gave this film a blend of realism , german expressionism and hollywood sentimentality . this works out fine , as bull is even more successful than before and becomes the uncrowned king of the chicago underworld . bull was portrayed as a burly , physical man with complex emotions . he always wanted to elevate feathers in stature and enjoyed doing it in a crass way , as he gave her jewelry as presents . that he could be generous as well as ruthless and had a laugh that could fill a room with his giant personality , made him a villain who was not one-dimensional . during its time this was an edgy film , but the times have changed and its story doesn't hold up as well today . it's a film that is mostly interesting for its historical contribution to cinema , as it set the conventions for this genre . it is also a visually challenging film , as sternberg filled the screen with symbols and imagery it had never seen before . this changed the way gangster films were made , and the visuals of this film are still considered to be innovative and stylish . some critics have classified this as an example of film noir mainly because of all the alienation and corruption shown . it's not like the film noir of the 1940s , but more like a noir predecessor . interestingly enough , at the first academy awards ceremony in 1929 , the film received its only award , for story writer ben hecht . "
589,"warning : spoiler in the next paragraph . the film ends with a long kiss between the japanese-american detective and the white artist , making a loud statement that it's fine that the heroine prefers someone of a different race . it's a satisfactory fuller work , that is lurid while also reflective of the racial divide in the country . in his gritty way , fuller hammers home the point of the need for racial tolerance and that there's urban alienation out there to deal with . the problem with the film , is that the mystery story was never developed and seems included as just an afterthought . "
590,"director joseph l . mankiewicz switched greene's anti-american premise around and made it an anti-communism theme , which was to the detriment of the film as it seemed to lose its potent messages . mankiewicz turns it into a feeble murder mystery and an uninvolving romantic love triangle , which is told in flashback . the film was shot in magnificent shades of black and white , and it was filmed on location in vietnam giving it a look of authencity . "
591,"warning : spoilers throughout review . the star of this film is pal's special effects , orchestrated by gordon jennings , which won an oscar . the acting was wooden , the romance was blah , and the religious messages tacked on were pathetic . but this sci-fi spectacle had much in it to be praised for ; it was especially scary , the martian design was sleek and ominous ( there were spider-like characters with cobra-like heads ) , and the recreation of an atomic bomb blast was spectacular . it wisely stuck to the theme of mankind's arrogant belief of his own superiority rather than go the red menace route as most sci-fi films of that day did . in the lab the scientists study samples of their blood collected and the martian electronic eye forrester salvaged , which the martians use as a periscope , leads the scientists to the conclusion that the martians are physically primitive even if they are mentally superior to us . they also have anemic blood and because of the darkness of mars , it's 140 million miles away from the sun , they can't handle a strong light . "
592,"the crime caper was too absurd and trite to carry the film , but the fast-pace and the finale featuring an exciting car chase through the deserted streets of lower manhattan gave the film some oomph . but backett pretends he doesn't know what he's saying , as he stalls to check out the story . it was a taut suspense film , catching the despair of the protagonist who because of his human failings had a momentary lapse in good judgment and went through a hellish experience to atone for his misdeed . but they just couldn't get any romance going in this film to make the story seem more palpable , as it works mainly for its action sequences . "
593,"in his short career , mark wahlberg has been most effective when playing characters full of na ? ve sincerity . in boogie nights , the yards , and even three kings , his talent is in making the audience believe he's a good guy with a lot of heart , just trying his best . the problem with the film lies in director stephen herek's inability to take advantage of the strengths that wahlberg displays . herek ( bill and ted's excellent adventure , mr . holland's opus ) , directing a screenplay from crazy/beautiful director john stockwell , does rely on wahlberg's sincerity at first -- we easily sympathize with chris' work ethic and passion -- but doesn't allow it to carry the movie later , when the film could really use it . from that point on , rock star unfortunately takes itself a little too seriously , taking time to document stuff we've already read about ( it is a full 15 years later , after all , and hair bands like motley crue have been telling these stories for a while ) . rock star would've been better off as a bigger satire of the time , ripping into the music , the people , and the period , and allowing wahlberg's wide-eyed , once-in-a-lifetime experiences to anchor the movie's emotional honesty and sympathy . aniston could have certainly contributed to that ; i can't imagine too many people staring into those expressive eyes on the big screen and not empathizing with the woman . that would go a long way in getting us deeper into the characters , but it doesn't happen . herek does direct the concert scenes with a certain urgency and is able to capture that arena rock experience , as cool or ridiculous as you might think it is . but as chris finds his way in the final act , the movie breaks down a bit , more interested in having us feel good than actually being sincere to the story . they should've asked mark wahlberg about sincerity -- he knows how it should work . rating : * * * |------------------------------| \ * * * * * perfection \ \ * * * * good , memorable film \ \ * * * average , hits and misses \ \ * * sub-par on many levels \ \ * unquestionably awful \ |------------------------------| "
594,"there isn't much of a plot , and what there is isn't that important . it is simply a frame within which to explore the culture of some vibrant spanish gypsies . in fact , the actual "" talkie "" scenes almost become too much of a distraction from the rich portrayal of the community . in between are moments with those in charge of the caravacas family , building a slow , poignant path to revenge . luckily the plot development is repetitively simple so that all of the characters have room to be sympathetic . there isn't an annoying "" good and evil "" perspective placed on the viewer . this film is not about picking sides in an argument or making morality calls . but the music and dancing are the key roles in vengo . between the variety shown and the pride taken in skill and passing down of tradition , it's easy to become mesmerized with the culture . a nice added touch is that men take as much pride as women in being able to evoke physical grace . and though the dancing does have a sexually alluring quality , it is not the reason for participation . it can be difficult to grasp the lyrics because they are only partially subtitled . this is unfortunate for outsiders who know little about gypsy life because it's impossible to guess at the inspiration for such emoting performances . at least the emotional expression of the singers provides an easily sympathetic intensity that evokes an understanding about how attached the music is to tradition . gatlif has managed to utilize an old , almost boring , plot structure to respectfully portray a culture much overlooked . he obviously loved his subject and the way in which it was filmed provides a contagious appreciation for a people often misunderstood . rating : * * * |------------------------------| \ * * * * * perfection \ \ * * * * good , memorable film \ \ * * * average , hits and misses \ \ * * sub-par on many levels \ \ * unquestionably awful \ |------------------------------| mpaa rating : nr "
595,"an enjoyable monogram made charlie chan mystery , with much trickery disguising who the real culprit is and a very clever premise but one that is not always well executed . this is accomplished through working the corpses like a puppeteer does the puppets , therefore it appears as if the dead person is walking . there was a flurry of one-liners , confusius-like sayings , and some stereotype racial fright humor by moreland exhibited . it all made for an entertaining but not totally satisfying film . "
596,"there's supposed to be no one aboard the ship , but all the passengers say they received a call from daniels to come aboard ; though , daniels denies ever making such a call . the boat remains at the dock , as charlie keeps everyone on the ship . he's a movie actor , travelling incognito . but , as is usually the case in this series , the least likely one is the guilty party . but the story itself made little sense . what was outstanding , was the atmospheric harbor scenes . this gave the film an eerie feeling and made the fishy story seem less briny . "
597,"a pleasant film that is not all that good as far as the crime caper story goes , but still has something about it that is endearing . it's in the tradition of hollywood films as escape vehicles , as it evokes a nostalgia for those kind of b-films that the studios used to routinely put out and were not that worried about the gaffes in the production . if you're a fan of the 1940s film noir , especially the classy billy wilder "" double indemnity , "" then you should find much in this latest woody allen comedy/mystery film to remind you of that film and others like it . woody sets this film in 1940 and catches with amazing accuracy the upholstered apartment furnishings , the lingo of the times , and the clothing worn and hairstyles . it was like watching one of those b-films , but instead of being in b & w this one is a lazy color version of it . it's the kind of faded out coloring that would have been used to make a 1940 film noir , if they were made in color . the retro scenes of all the interiors were exquisitely designed by santo loquasto and shot by zhao fei in mostly plum and gold colors that burnished on the screen . that's a home he made burglar-proof . admittedly this is all a thin and rather predictable story incorporating the usual woody nebbish sexist and egotististical character , and to make matters worse it comes with an unbelievable heist plot and with mechanical one-liners with silly double-entendre sexual meanings . it's a role that he's ritualized and could do it sleepwalking by now . but it worked for me because i didn't care about all that and instead got caught up with the film's casual look and the way it caught the look of the period's film noir , and i found the clash he had with helen hunt brought out the sides of his personality that he's battling within himself all his artistic life . woody seems more relaxed in this role than he has been in his more recent films . and , since the film has no artistic pretensions--it's more a homage to the b-films of the forties , it seemed easier to handle than some of his more recent ritualized woody-by-the-numbers flicks or those pale imitations of those european auteurs he so much admired like bergman--films he slavishly imitated that never worked for him . mind you , this is not a good film but one that can be viewed as an escape from reality . something that is not all that bad during these troubling economic days of that compassionate conservative administration of president bush . seeing this film made me forget for the moment about bush's war on stem cell research and the way he goes out of his way to please his extreme right-wing supporters and those big corporations that also supported him . the same purpose could be said of those early films in the forties , with the world being invaded by nazis . escape films were very much in vogue and served a purpose . i don't usually care for escape films , but every so often they feel right and can be enjoyable if you can really escape reality by watching them . those are the kinds of films i let my critical guard down on , and that's the case with this woody allen flick . "
598,"richard wallace directs a film noir that is more a character study than it is a puzzler . it was an entertaining b-film that ably caught an honest but desperate man somehow hooking up with a falsehearted woman in a dangerous relationship , as the actors good performances overcame the cheap production values and slight story . "
599,"a film noir that is more a character study of a small-time jewel thief than one concerned with its pulp story . the artistic shots are like those that orson welles did in "" the lady from shanghai . "" the film succeeds as a visual feast in noir photography , which includes shadowy framed scenes and close-ups of the characters sweating during the heist . the film's weaknesses lie in the slight story and how it came at the end of the film noir cycle , so all the artistry of the noir devices seemed to be beaten to the ground by now . "
600,"this film has a different look to it , as its color tones are strikingly in browns and soft yellows . they added a touch of black humor . ripstein also has a dizzying amount of extra shots of things that don't play exactly into the story but add some arty points he's trying to make about the outside influences facing the alienated julia . i wasn't enlightened by these unnecessary scenes , in fact i thought they were pretentious . almost the entire film is a boring rant by julia , where a fine actress like arcelia ramirez just over acted and failed to bring the audience over to her side . her classical story didn't play like great drama , but felt more like soap opera or a tragic headline newspaper story one reads these days of a mother snapping and killing her children for no logical reason . all the drama evaporated from this presentation , as the film's reward seemed to be a visual feast of looking at the interior of an apartment situated in an ugly apartment building's courtyard . yet this film shouldn't be totally ignored , as the auteur director took chances with this story and was technically innovative as he gave the film a different look to it . that alone should earn him applause for the effort made . at least , his film wasn't stale as most commercial ventures are today . the overriding fault for this art-house film was that it is not poetic in a story that must be poetic to be felt as drama and not soap opera . it unfortunately comes off as too distant ( it's lost in the mundane world for the answers to julia's problems ) for the viewer to empathize with julia's internal misery . it also suffers from comparison to other medea presentations--so many great versions of it were put on as plays , plus the film versions by pasolini and von trier were far superior . "
601,"one of those innovative shoestring budget sci-fier films that edgar g . ulmer made a career out of . this one is overall a competent work with some uniquely atmospheric scenes . it used the same set designs as ingrid bergman did in the 1948 "" joan of arc . "" the alien invaders didn't put up much of a fight , but i bet if ulmer had a few more days of shooting time we would have seen a lot more action . "
602,"considering the budget constraints the film was operating under , this film nevertheless proves to be an entertaining one and features a well-crafted script by jerome bixby ; it is one that is devoid for the most part ( except for the character played by kim spalding ) of stock characterizations . it sets an eerie atmosphere by its shadowy photography and in the claustrophobic setting of the spaceship , and even if the monster in a rubber-suit was not as scary as laughable--that only proves how much fun the film could be . i happened to like it better than i did alien , even though the later is technically far superior . "
603,"he has taught film at columbia university and nyu , and has said that he made this film because he can't remember as a youth watching films that were made in chile . the film was written spontaneously while at the workshop to fit the emotions of the teenage actors recruited . it's a familiar theme about teenage alienation , as the story suffers at times from being strained . also , there are raw emotional scenes that are difficult to watch when they are extended for too long . but what prevents this one from just being a clich ? teenager film , is that they are presented as genuine teens even if they are not that appealing and the story might not be compelling to everyone--especially those who watch such loud kids in public places and are turned off by them ( i guess that would include me in that category ) . the film is political in nature and it should be best understood by the teens now living in chile who are familiar with the social climate in their home turf . the teens grapple with their frustrations and loneliness , and mature somewhat by the film's end . this seemed to be what the audience was rooting for to happen , as they were obnoxious but not bad sorts . "
604,"a gothic mom-in-distress thriller for those who might believe in ghosts or at least are open-minded , or for those who like a scary puzzler story to be grounded in those old-fashioned techniques of getting at the human emotions rather than being a computerized technical special-effects production of the supernatural . the 29-year-old acclaimed chilean-born , spanish-based director , alejandro amen ? bar ( open your eyes/thesis ) , provides a surprise ending to this chiller , which the clever viewer might guess since there are enough clues laid down . that's something "" the sixth sense "" did , but there it worked better because the story was more plausible and less artsy , so when the surprise ending resulted it seemed more satisfactory than in amen ? bar's film . the dark and somber tone of amen ? bar's film lingers for too long to make it seem anything more than an atmospheric and stylish mumbo jumbo scare film . it creeps along at a gruelingly slow pace , belaboring its point that ghosts can live among the living . but time seems irrelevant here , as it could be set at any time , though the story fits most readily into the victorian period . the house is not only creepy and filled with ghost sounds , but is enveloped in darkness because all the windows must be covered with thick curtains as the children are mysteriously allergic to the light and if exposed it could be fatal to them . there are 50 doors , 15 keys , and enough dark corners and creaky floorboards to even scare a dead person . when those clich ? d scary formula effects don't work enough scares , the background music goes into a high crescendo to add more chills . it's a scary movie because it takes on a number of different themes ; such as , madness , ghosts haunting a house , religious dogma , sexual repressions , and hysteria . the film was heading in the right direction until the surprise ending left me less pleased with it . the striking performance by ms . kidman , who carries this pic , and the feeling of loneliness it had established , make it a film that has much to recommend it despite its shortcomings . "
605,"a chic modern vampire tale that is visually pleasing in its presentation but its scattered storyline seemed anemic , as it wavers between a love and horror story . it also offers a facile philosophy tract on good and evil ( the chinese director studied philosophy in england ) , as the director takes a stab at making this film into a religious fable about finding the truth . that i take to be the film's heavy statement , as it comes between the vampire's long stares , heavy breathing sounds , and gushy looks at his women vics before he sates himself on their blood . it was a strange and stylishly modern vampire tale that is set in london , that tried to be ever so cute and succeeded mostly in being enigmatic and weirdly captivating as both a thriller and a romance story . the relationship between the cop and the suspect was grounded in reality and had the only dialogue in the film that wasn't risible . their perfect love is interrupted by some ridiculous dialogue between them , especially the one about the theory of three-brains . the film isn't good when it comes to following the script , it seems pleasing only because of the visually chilling atmosphere it presents . this is the kind of delicate horror film with artsy pretensions that has law tell the pale looking l ? wensohn , that he needs the love that is in her blood . there were too many lines like that for me to be pleased with the film overall , as it seemed to me that it wished it could be more campy and funny yet it foolishly took itself to be a serious drama . there was something comical in its blood that it couldn't quite get out of its bloodstream . he lacks a specific component in his blood without which he will die . a good premise does not necessarily lead to a good script , and that's what does this hazy puzzler in : the beautiful looking film just doesn't make sense and can't be explained away by such weak attempts at philosophizing . "
606,"a syrupy serving of freudian analysis that looks tempting but tastes of too much superego , id , and subconsious jive to be taken seriously . it's hollywood's version about what psychoanalysis is all about , which is making the analyst a combination of a savior and parental figure who can magically unlock the secrets of the mentally ill by offering them love and concern on a couch . this is the first major film about that subject , and its sincere presentation to show it in its best light is often awkward and seems quite outdated when viewed today . hitchcock throws in a murder mystery that works a little better than all the mumbo jumbo psych 1 lingo the viewer must sit through . it's a very heavy-handed film that is earnestly played by the stars , but has no resonance . it was one of the master's weaker films , yet it's still worth seeing because there are many imaginative hitchcock touches throughout . the script was written by ben hecht , who obviously didn't have much of a feel for the subject-matter . ingrid and peck do their best to work through the stale lines they are forced to say , though they never make their characters believable despite their best thespian efforts . this film is really spellbound . "
607,"it is shot in a semi-documentary style and looked more like a crime caper movie than the film noir category most film critics have classified it under . the story of duke malloy catches ferguson's interest . to make the film more snappy the producers called in raoul walsh , though not credited , to shoot some scenes over . but the filmlooks dated . "
608,"it has an exciting plot and is properly atmospheric despite its cheap studio sets . but , it seemed anti-climactic when compared to the tight story that preceeded it . the film had the mood of film noir , as milland is the innocent one who has no luck convincing society that he is indeed innocent . there is a sinister tone to the film that plays well . it's a scene that perfectly captures the chilling mood this thriller evoked . "
609,"one film critic , tom milne , aptly said that cornel wilde maintains his reputation in this film for making the most likable bad movies around . sharks' treasure is an action-packed nonsense thriller that is very entertaining . in this oddity film , wilde is the producer , writer , director , and star . he could have used someone else to give him some help with the plot and he could have worked more with the supporting cast to make their roles more plausible and meaty . everyone seemed like a cartoon character , as there was no attempt made at character development or for the storyline to make too much sense . the film feels like it's stuck in a strange space-warp , as the all-male treasure hunters are out at sea and are pretty close to going insane . these hombres are bad dudes , bad actors , and bad punsters . this all seems bizarre and hardly real , but it's full of emotion and the action is a hoot to behold . it's a film that has to be seen to be treasured for what it brings up from such a slight story . "
610," joy ride  is calculated to draw fear from the viewer and does not attempt to develop character or enlarge its story , as it goes on a wild cross-country ride into dark terrain . its menacing trucker theme reminded me most of steven spielberg's 1971 film "" duel , "" though this one is played more for laughs . it's also aided by many noirish images and small touches among the supporting characters that give the film a quirky humor , as it scales familiar genre territory from remote gas stations to dead-end dusty roads to hostile redneck bars . but here the material is freshened with a different take on it . but we never see him through the hazy windshield of his rig , which makes him even more scary . how he does--just doesn't seem to matter , as the film plays out its hand as a sophomoric joke gone dangerously bad . anyway , while the story is moving at a frenetic pace , serious thought is not called for . there's b-film fun here if you don't mind the many holes in the story and how slight the plot is and how the sadistic trucker can set so many successful traps for them when it doesn't seem possible , and that we are never let in on the secret of how he does it . fuller nervously says , "" much more than usual . "" but there's always an element of fun in how absurd this all is , and the mostly teen-ager audience where i saw this film laughed at parts of it and shrieked in fright during the parts that were creepy . it's not a terribly interesting film but the director john dahl ( "" red rock west "" / "" the last seduction "" ) and his writers clay tarver and j . j . abrams , have made a film that knows its audience and knows how to pull its punches . it's an easy film to critique for what it doesn't do , but what it does do very well is take you for a comically dark fantasy ride and the filmmaker keeps this thriller tense throughout . the result is a cleverly done cultish film that's scary , building to that grotesquely violent finale in the motel . it's also a bit kinky without any explicit sex scenes . a film that should be admired totally for its entertainment value and filmmaking craftsmanship , and the engaging performance by zahn . "
611,"his slow but steady transformation into political awareness is the most reassuring omen sent out in this non-didactic , straight forward ambitious project of sayles . the strength that comes from such a story , is in the telling of it and the powerful images presented . the problem with all this , is that since no specific country was named , it must mean that sayles considers this to be a universal problem , and that makes the problem gigantic , with no one to be specifically blamed , especially since these kind of human abuses have been going on for ages , it becomes difficult to zero in on what can be done to prevent such happenings . the other problem is that one can get the feeling that there reaches a point where one feels he is being manipulated , that there is so little that can be done by individuals alone , that governments have to be held accountable for their actions , and people have to be aware of what their governments are doing , even if , most of all , people have to learn how to help themselves . this is a very strong , independent minded picture , that chooses to tell a very difficult story , one that not many people will take comfort in . but the question arises as to how the message of such despair will get out to people who are so far removed from that isolated part of the world . it seems that this film might have some influence , but there is little that individuals who are not from that region can do , as proof we have just to look at the terrors faced by those in this film who tried to help . dennis schwartz : movie reviews ozus @sover . net "
612,"the cast is superb . it is rare that a film has such a meaty part for one woman to play . . . this film has two such parts . the girls never seemed taken with a genuine love of music except as it suited their talents . the well-crafted screenplay by frank cottrell boyce , is ably directed by tucker , who is directing his first feature film . the only fault i found with his direction , is that i thought it was unnecessary to have duplicate scenes of what hilary and jackie experienced , that is , we didn't have to see it from each one's point of view . i thought the film would have been better served if the action was continuous , the going back over the same scenes from a different point of view really killed the pace of the film , slowing it down too much . this is a film that glows with confidence , sparked by a maturity of material , that tries to unravel some of the mysteries in life that make one wonder about certain decisions made that can impact one's entire life . the film worked so well because of the contrasts between the two female stars , they prevented the film from burying itself in a pit of sadness and , also , it was deftly handled by the director's ability to keep the movie light , not to make jackie's situation into a downer . . . and the music helped , it was simply marvelous . "
613,"and somehow rappaport concocts a mythic love tale around this premise , that is similar in some aspects to the orpheus and eurydice myth , whereas orpheus rescued his love from hades , but even though he was told by the gods not to look back or she would disappear , he did look back because of his insecurities and fear that eurydice would think that he didn't care for her anymore . so she lets her live with her , even though she would rather not have her there . this film is distinguished by its stylish use of opera , classical painting , and victorian soap opera like-dramatics , to get across its strange wit and rilkean-like observations of what can be seen from life when you become a passive observer of it . it could be a very witty movie if you are receptive to the characters' personality foibles , as they mock or imitate what the real-life troubled modern heterosexuals in nyc are up to , as paul acts out the part at being the tall dark , silent type of macho he-man , who is animalistic in his attraction to both sisters : estelle , with her pretentious romantic soul , who is endowed with beautiful breasts ; and her more down to earth sister , who is not the romantic type , but is more prosaic in her outlook toward life , who is attractive but suffers from psychological problems and fits of violence . everyone is meant to be a cartoon character , ones' whom you can poke fun at , especially when they take themselves seriously . estelle becomes a sort of representative of all women who are bitchy , wrongfully hurt in a relationship , or too consumed in their fantasy world of what a guy should be like to ever form a lasting relationship . the film's aim is to be humorous about this . in any case , this is a very unusual and original work , that is sometimes slow-going , missing the mark by being too outrageous and covering far too much ground for its own good ; but , more often than not , it is right on the mark , using its token males , paul , as an insignificant stud , a servicer of the female race , and jack , as an untrustworthy spouse , perceived as being capable of violent acts , as the sisters encompass the gamut of womanly wants in a man , in a most peculiar way . this film should appeal to urban dwellers who have been in a triangular heterosexual relationship and came out of it more confused than when first entering it and to those who have a more tolerant and sophisticated attitude toward impossible relationships . . . . . incidently , the funniest line in the movie is reserved for paul , who tells estelle , "" i wouldn't even tell you a lie , much less the truth . "" i think that line summarizes what the movie is ultimately about . "
614,"keitel , if you stretch your gullability a bit , is a great american film director , returning to his native greece after 35- years in the states . what fascinates him , is that they saw the century come in with its hopes and aspirations , they were not politically motivated , but were interested in recording what went on with the people and the times they lived in , what was right and wrong about those times , regardless of the mess that resulted from the mistakes the politicians made . this is an ostentacious and mesmerizing film , about a film director's obsession with the importance film plays in recording history . it is also a film that is bleak and despairing , as it goes on its long and weary journey over hostile territories , where governments could never be anything but inhumane and where revolutions were betrayed and costly . this allows us to see what the director saw as a child . again , it is a homage to how important it is to record history so that it cannot be forgotten . this allows for the film to wax poetic , to become a meditation on the landscape , to indulge our sense of the incomprehensible , as we see what the film-maker is seeing ; we all become foreigners in this eeriness , in this lost century , where the truth has been maimed . its images are always powerful , even if the dialogue seems superfluous and banal . it is starkly photographed in the fog and in the rubble torn buildings where the people barely exist , as they remain there , hoping for miracles to get them by . the fog is the only place normalcy is allowed to be , and even here , the dangers are always in the background . that is the message delivered , from this politically motivated and visually aesthetic film , full of emotion and bereavement for what could have been , but is now ruined by blind hatred . the film is tiresome , at times , too cliche ridden for the potent message it delivers for it be as great as its cinematography is . "
615,"dark city is a sci - fi/noir thriller , that portends to deliver a message relating to the powers of the mind and the meaning of identity . everything attempted here has been done before , but that still doesn't take away from the film's feeling of looking like it is an original . credit must go to the creative use of special effects and the outstanding set designs used for its bedimmed city . and since he is not sure if he did it or not , he has a dazed look on his puss , like he will have throughout the entire film . hurt is the deadpan , hard - nosed type of movie cop you would see in a 40s noir film , leading the investigation . he will be on the run for the remainder of the film , innocent though he may be , just like a protagonist in earlier noir films , questioning authority and trying to pull himself together , unsure of whom to trust . his visit to the automat brought back pleasant memories of my childhood in nyc , but this automat was cheerless and cold , only its bright lights served as a sharp contrast to the dark eeriness of this city . he falls in love with her anyway , and the message of the film becomes only too clear , it is in the heart that the individual is born , and the heart can't be dissected and experimented with like a science blinded by technology and ignorant of the imagination . proyas has created a visually challenging movie , that is backed - up by some thoughtful ideas . it is the kind of film that ufo'ers and alien watchers will tell ya' , see , i told you there was life out there in space . but to others , this is still only pedestrian stuff , it is not the real deal . and the flat acting did not add anything positive to the story . i enjoyed the film for its ambience and for the creative mood it set . but what diminished its positives , was how the main purpose of the actors seemed to be , to spout robotic messages for the characters they were portraying . i wished that proyas had enough confidence to allow his visions to do the talking . "
616,"pi is an earnestly written and directed , low-budget black & white shot sci-fi film that is made for intellectuals , but shows them in a depressing light . the attacks he gets on the nyc subway are particularly horrifying , such as being followed and seeing a brain on the subway platform . its number has served the public well for generations . but our hero is rebellious of this symbol's status quo in society . margolis futilely shouts out that he should go home and relax , and take a bath : that he thinks too much , he should learn how to act more intuitively . the flaw in this intellectualual characterization of gullette , is that the director chooses to end gullette's vision and search , by saying it is not so bad that he took out a piece of his brain because of all the problems he was having , now he can experience the ordinary things of life . what is clear , is that aronofsky blames science , just as much as he does capitalism and religion for the way the world is in turmoil . this is aronofsky's first feature , something he won best director for at the sundance film festival . it is good to see that a film that is so cerebral and difficult to make can so popularly be received by selected audiences and most critics . but this being said , the film's popularity still scares me : i think it is popular for the wrong reason . this film , in retrospect , might be viewed as an anti-intellectual film since it emphasizes that gullette is more appealing when he is not completely absorbed in his intellectual pursuit . just as the film's merits are easy to praise , the film's flaws are easy to find fault with . aronofsky has his protagonist retreating sophomorically into passivity in lieu of his quest ; this flaw should not be overlooked , it so seriously challenges the film's main character from establishing who he is and from our understanding of what is really being said about intellectuals . i think , it should have been emphasized , that it is irrelevant that the protagonist is an intellectual , because he could be any personality type and that would not alter the fact that he was going through a nervous breakdown , and in essence , that is what has happened to gullette , who is just marvelous in this very complex role , in a film that gives off a rich aroma of intellectual pursuit , but cannot digest the full intellectual and mystical meal it has cooked . "
617,"a heavy going and at times annoying , but , nevertheless , embroiling drama . religion acts as an inhibiting and possessive experience throughout the film , as the first time director weaves a tale of alienation and sexual liberation in a puritan type of setting . it is easy to realize how difficult it is to break from one's religious traditions if you are raised and indoctrinated with it . the flaws in the film are that the direction is at times unfocused , as too many scenes are awkwardly shot and difficult to watch and comprehend . there just seems to be too much internally going on for any follow-up scenes to uncover all the loose ends that remain untied . the protestant family is way too complicated to gloss over its 19th century life style . the film is too long and boring at times ; and , the love affair was not credible considering the lack of passion ( these lovers were just not a believable match ) ; and , the film hammers out too many far reaching religious themes that it cannot properly address . but the acting and cinemaphotography are superb . her sexually explicit scenes with wilkinson added to the religious tremors of the film and the sense of her alienation , but since i did not find their passion convincing , it was difficult for me to believe that their relationship would have taken place . the governess is an absorbing , marvelously acted film , but not necessarily an entertaining one . "
618,"the story is funny , somewhat romantic , though at times resembling more a tv series like columbo than a movie , but in the end turns back to the private eye genre it started out in . i thoroughly enjoyed this uncanny and inventive caper , except for the unconvincing acting between pullman and kim ( she was too lethargic ) -- which made it difficult for me to get involved with their relationship . zero had a light heartedness about it that was endearing and worthy of that mind solving sherlock holmes genre it so alluringly wanted to emulate , but too lacking in overall integrity to achieve more of an original tone to it , than turn out to be a reasonably witty film , achieved under the direction of the young son of the famous film director . "
619,"what gets into the headlines determines how most of us view the world . emira nusevic plays herself , with the realistic sense of danger emanating from one who actually lived through this story . since the war is precipitated at this point in history by the serbs , the film has little choice but to point out that the serbs are mainly responsible for what is happening now . what is so forcefully happening in sarajevo , even though it is on the news everyday , has not caught the american people's attention as much as you might think it would . the this film offers an honest portrait of the media in action , as it also depicts a public that is more interested in being entertained than being informed . it seems as if the public could care less about what is happening there . so it shouldn't be all that surprising that the public also showed its indifference at the box-office to this heartfelt film . "
620,"for most of us , we have formed an opinion on how we think it works , even if we realize that statistics of arrests and convictions do not tell us the whole story . it is not until we see an actual trial , do we sense how delicate a system we have , how in the hands of forthright , honest , intelligent , and fair-minded participants , the system should work fine , but if that is not so , we better watch out , the system can backfire on us and make us scratch our heads and wonder if it is possible for justice to work . and that is what this objective documentary does , as it allows us into the courtroom to see how the participants do their job . for some reason there is a separate trial for jessie miskelly , the pint sized 17-year-old , who has an iq of 72 , he speaks in a slow and deliberately awkward manner , and seems less intelligent than even that low score indicates . just seeing them and hearing their story , and seeing no solid proof put forward , except for innuendo and a coerced confession , is not what i call a solid case against them . the job they did frightened the heck out of me , because of their unwillingness to check everything out , and as much as the crime revolted me , this revolted me with almost equal disdain . this is a knife that could have very likely been used in the crime . jason could hardly say a word , and seems to be mortified , not really aware of what is going on , and appears to have no connection with anything occult , except he likes to hang around with damien and listen to heavy metal music . if ever there was to be a public outcry against how the judicial system works and the arbitrary use of the death penalty , this film should give you food for thought about how unfair the judicial system can be for those who are of the poor class . it was frightening for me to watch how the process works . there is no outcry from the community about injustice , and even if this case is the exception to the way the courts operate , that most cases are handled with more of a search for justice and with less of a rush to judgment , which i sincerely doubt , this compelling documentary leaves me perplexed , not only in my questioning of the verdict , but the whole process itself , and wondering if our system is so flawed , that it would really be damaging to impose a death penalty sentence on anyone , realizing how political all verdicts appear to be . "

623,"the father is paternally played with a very sweet charm , by veteran actor , seymour cassel . this is an original and quirky story , but it also follows a long tradition of films that took similar routes ( ferris bueller's day off , the graduate ) , so what seems to be taking place and in what direction it is going and who max is , cannot be simply or absolutely stated , which is great in some ways but completely mind-blowing in other ways , as this somewhat cheesy story has more holes in it than swiss cheese , yet no matter how it seems to be served , it always seems to be a story that is tastefully done . max is not exactly a nerd , as he is pushy , being neither completely likable nor obnoxious , who propels himself into the rushmore scene by pursuing extra-curricular activities to such a degree that it reaches the point of absurdity , as he is involved in so many diverse activities , that it is a wonder he has time to even take off the preppy jacket he loves to wear around the campus . it is at rushmore where he is bursting with untold energy for adventure , entrepenureship , and romance . there are many twists to come into play as the story is disarmingly told , forcing us not too get too comfortable in what we expect to be a sane commentary of the going-ons here . these scenes were wickedly cruel to comprehend , as the story flipped over from comedy to psychological drama , and to a certain extent , a temporary suspension of belief . yet it was this facet of the story that was most novel and daring about the film , as it let the characters freely play out who they were without contrivance . therefore , even if you didn't particularly care about the way things were going , you were at least taken aback by seeing how everyone interacted with each other . blume retaliating by smashing the kid's bike . the young director's previous film , bottle rocket , was also written by him with owen wilson , it was also quirky but a bit less professionally done . both films show promise of better things to come . there are still patches to this story that need further developing and to be pruned along the edges before we can say we have things in order , but after saying that , i must say that this is still a first-rate film , with a lot of bite to it , depicting characters in a discrete way that allows them to be very real and formidable . this is bill murray's best role yet , and for newcomer , jason schwartzman , the son of actress talia shire , a role made for him in filmdom heaven . "
624,"even though , arthur miller wrote this film for marilyn , and she was most affecting in this vulnerable role she had , this was possibly the best role gable ever had , excluding gwtw . also , it is interesting to note that this was both clark's and marilyn's last film . clark insisted on doing all the rigorous stunts for the film . if you are looking for that kind of western here , you will not find it , even though you have a director and stars of the film who have been very successful in previous western films , depicting that genre as it has come to be expected . there are no heroes here , only lonely people trying to live with their illusions , just like the audience is trying to see them as they were led to believe cowboys should be like . all this might be confusing for those who never dreamed they would see a western with its stars having psychological problems , and worried about earning a living . that sounds too much like what ordinary people are going through . this is a superior western despite its non-action and debunking of one of cinema's great myths , mainly because of its incisive characterizations of these misfits , and because it was fun watching these big stars work together , especially when realizing that there was a lot of truth in the script that pertained to their real-life situations . "
625,"how do you like to see christ depicted in films ? the wachowski brothers must think they hit upon something really important to convey , because in my book , any film that goes way over two hours in length , thinks of itself as important , and by earmarking the young literate computer age audience to buy into their intellectual sci-fi'er , as they flatter them by telling them that it is only at a young age that one can develop the ability to have a chance of understanding the message delivered here , they have done just that , making me wonder how they expect adults to react to their film . and the good news the film brings , is that "" the one "" is alive , as prophesized in the bible . as the filmmakers get involved in their little pseudo-philosophy game of what's real and what isn't , promising those with an open mind a chance to be unplugged , to find out what is real . i think , they really believe they will get unplugged , mainly , because they had the good sense to pay money to see the movie . what the wachowski brothers are good at is style and visuals , and what we see on screen is ground breaking fun to watch , in the form of exhilarating camera work from the opening sequence onwards , as a mixture of kung-fu and sci-fi schmaltz is used , which is as entertaining as it is ominously intellectually pretentious , as a computer hacker named trinity ( moss ) , she is a take off on mary magdalene , which is why there is no sex between her and neo , just intent eye contact , as she uses her kung-fu and super-natural skills , just like its done in the comics , to escape from a police trap , that comes by way of info an informer gave them . all that talk , all those explanations , every bit of pseodo- philosophical occultism is pulled out of the hat to make the story plausible , except the more rationally it is explained by the group's leader , morpheus , the more holes in his story are opened up , and the judas in his group , who only wants to return to the matrix , in his old job at the factory , is tired of all this hype after nine years of eating the same slop , is played by cypher ( joe ) , now eating a juicy steak with the agents and declaring ignorance is bliss , seems to make as much sense as the mumbo-jumbo morpheus is talking about . as morpheus explains all this to neo , who believe me , if you just take one look at him , no one in his right mind would mistake him for even one second , as "" the one . "" i don't think he even has time to go out and see an escapist sci-fi film , just for kicks . it is serious business saving the world , with not many people even willing to thank you for your effort . but he , at least , found morpheus , the one he was searching for , but as an interesting twist in the story , it was morpheus who was looking for him . you will only get questions in this film , not answers . but one of the questions is , from what source do the questions come from , and that is answered in an interview with the directors , i read in the film 'zine , american cinematographer , as the wachowski brothers freely talked about what kind of film they were trying to make and who influenced them . the film ends with neo , looking like clark kent , as he is stepping out of a telephone booth , to give the film the full comic book flavor it deserves , as if superman is there , already in place , ready to stop the bad guys . for the film's point of reference to anything resembling theology and theory , it was jean baudrillard's simulacra and simulation that was used as reference material , referring to his take on ecclessiastics . he is the modern french philospher , with his theories of time as unreal and his critique of hyperreality and how the truth can't be reached , but violence can , that influenced the wachowski brothers in the making of this film . but even more than a biblical film ( though if you are looking for this to be a spiritual film , there are plenty of symbols in the film to allude to this being so ) , or another look at the world of lewis carroll's alice in wonderland , this is a computer-age film , that questions if we have just become batteries for our computers , who have evolved past us in their knowledge of the world . and the only intellectual question we may be left to ask ourselves , if we take the new myth presented here seriously , is who needs christ when we got superman , or do we need neither or both , or do we just need christ ? "
626,"as for me , i'm not partial to these pentecostal preachers and their heavy handed , pushy methods of self-righteousness . to watch a movie , which almost imitates a church service in length and purpose , is not particularly entertaining or spiritual for my tastes . what this film does very well , is examine the character of the man preaching , and what affect religion has on the people . duvall is sonny , the apostle . if we didn't live in a society where so many folks think like him and mistakeningly and arrogantly take the letter of the bible as gospel , then he would be considered a certifiable nut case . what duvall has is zeal , he is a non-stop talker , always railing on about jesus and satan , quoting scriptures , offering up the whole evangelical bag of tricks . that he is good at it , is not the question . that he is annoying , except to those who need to be with someone like him , someone who is demonstrative in his praise of god , someone who can make them feel good about themselves , even if they are a sinner and a lost soul , is another thing . these unevangelical moments , of him on a date with her , talking real talk , were gems , and these scenes made the film a more enjoyable experience . it was also fun to watch duvall smile , because as good an actor as he is , and he is one of the good ones , his friendly smile always has a trace of cruelty around the edges . it seems he can only play parts where he is all wired up , frenetically moving in every scene . in this film , he has created a work that tries to be more than entertaining , reaching for a more artistic film . as for me , i live not to be preached to . what made the picture dull for me , is the subject matter . but what excites me about this film , is that i believe it has a truth to it , that can't be denied ; and that , duvall has accomplished a virtuoso performance , supported by some excellent actors in supporting roles and non-professional actors giving the film an intimacy and a flavor to it that is special . "
627,"la femme nikita ( director : luc bresson ; cast : anne parillaud , jean-hughes anglade , tcheky karyo , jean reno , jeanne moreau , 1990-fr . ) an exciting and entertaining actioner that tests the plausibility of its story with an unreality check , yet is real on its emotional levels , testing the heroine's reactions to love , guilt , loss of identity , and a deprived upbringing , which is rare for this genre to be so concerned with actual human values . anne , the wife of luc , plays nikita with a flair , exhibiting the tremendous energy and orneriness needed to make the part exceptional . the film plays like an mtv special , using a splash of coloring to light up the screen and very fast paced action sequences to keep you mindlessly glued to the screen . but that is disarming , since this film has more than that to offer , even if it does not seem so during certain stretches of the film . it is worth sticking with this film , it gets better and less predictable the more you get into it . though its ending , does leave a lot to be desired . this part of the story lags , as we watch how this violent misfit channels her anti-social aggressiveness into acceptibility for her new role in life , one that society , supposedly , can appreciate . there is one great scene where we see the young nikita putting on makeup next to moreau , and we are dazzled by looking at the faces of the two stars fill-up the screen , with moreau , wrinkles and all , still looking quite sexy and alluring , and in my way of looking at things , the one who is the more alluring . so , we have come full cycle , and nikita has developed an appreciation for life that she never had before , leaving us with much moral fodder to chew on , more than most actioners leave us with , and we come to the understanding that this incredible story , that is hardly plausible , that is seemingly cartoonish , is much better than it appears on surface because somehow or other it satisfies our need to know something about covert operations and the people who go into it on a non-voluntary basis , plus the movie is very entertaining and was able to hold our attention , even through the rough spots in it . "
628,"this is fundamentally a feminist oriented road movie without the politics of the movement playing a part in the story , as the film is steeped in personal irony over abandonment of loved ones and fantasies that can't become real , without any particular message to deliver , except that these two have their hands full coping with their life , as it seems , it is only by their humor and forceful spirit that they can manage to survive . since they consider themselves artists , they feel their act speaks for itself and are particularly upset at being blind sided by one hostile viewer of their show , an overweight lady who feels that they made fun of how obese women look in their act and she felt they did a disservice to women who have that problem , as she upsets them as she rails at them before walking out . since the family treats him as someone not to be taken seriously , yet it is quite evident , that he , alone , has a real love for something that the bourgeois in his family just don't have . a chocolate salesman tells them every one is an actor trying to sell their product , but the important thing is , if you try hard enough people will forgive you for what you are lacking or might not even notice it . that his gimmick is to get the children to eat the chocolate first , then the parents are delighted that the kids like the chocolate , so his sale becomes an easy one . though , what stands out , is the marvelously genuine performances of the heroines of the story and how appealing they were in such a troublesome way , that there public appearance might seem calm and collected , but behind the scenes they are being gnawed at by all the chaos in their life . this thought provoking film , touched many different themes with equal breath and veracity , but this also highlighted its most glaring weakness , that it couldn't focus in on any one theme completely , as it mostly questioned middle-class values and the need for a person to find a way to express themselves enthusiastically , pointing out that maybe , that is all one can hope for , yet leaving so many other things unanswered that it brought up , that you could write your own movie from all that was left unsaid that remains speculative about the girls and their situation . "
629,"she , in fact , looks a lot like the director . so we can guess that some of these horrible experiences are something that might have happened to him in puberty . this loner theme is belabored and beaten into the story , so much so , that the obvious couldn't be made more obvious . there are no subtle messages . there is , also , no revenge of the nerd , or any analytical probes into what she can do about her low self-esteem ( and i am most grateful for that ) . this is simply a film that looks at why schools and families , for the most part , impart no concern about "" culture "" in the children they teach and raise , and why they can't respond with civility and intelligence to those students who need the most help that they can get . and the response is given so bluntly : "" because you are so ugly . "" he acts more like he was an adult than a teenager , even the rock band he starts , is not a rebellious one , but he does it because it will look good on his resume for college . in any case , whatever she does seems pathetic , and even though she is very smart , she does not do well in school . since the film sinks or swims , depending on how credible heather is in depicting this unhappy youngster with her vulnerabilities , it is safe to say that she fitted the role perfectly . there was no place to go in developing heather's character by adding these major societal problems to heather's story , that's for another film . solondz knows his subject well , he is able to understand and convey what it is to be brought up with self-hatred and how such people can react by being sometimes just as cruel as the society they are a product of , and the result is an unusual movie that focuses in on a subject very few filmmakers have chosen to do . "
630,"as the one giving the orders , the big boss , he is a less portly version of sydney greenstreet , playing the type of role once reserved for the mirthful greenstreet . don't ask too much more about the plot , it is not particularly pertinent , and some explanations about what this film is about , were obviously snipped off at the cutting room . but an unclear story and poor dubbing quality of most of the non-english speaking actors , does not really hamper the absurdity presented on screen , because it is done in such a way , that it defies any critical commentary , having a dark humor about it that is funnier than hell . chabrol has gone to absurd extremes of humor in this commercially driven screwball comic/mystery , that has the agents working for the greek government , at least i think that is who they are working for . the one in charge of them , is a lazy , sleazy , and mediocre bureaucrat , named sharp ( bouquet ) , aptly named because he is a dull wit , who is clueless about what is going on , as he confronts the two agents working for him , the imaginative but usually wrong , robert , and the more steady dex ( ronet ) , who like sharp , has his eye on robert's appealing wife , shanny , only he doesn't get his face slapped like sharp does by her , as sharp makes too much of an overt pass at her . jean seberg , the much maligned actress , is just terrific in this breezy role , showing a certain amount of vulnerability and courage and sex appeal , and an eye for comic timing , as she takes over for robert when he is killed just before he was going to tell her the info he has about the black boxes , and they were to celebrate the news with champagne and love making . the road to corinthe , the european title for the film , is the road to the marble foundry owned by kalhides . it is the place where there is this great mix of intrigue and murder and comedy , as the black boxes are discovered there , hidden in the statues' heads , and as kalhides says , if you think i'm not imaginative enough to put them someplace else , you are wrong , because some of them i have put in the base of the statue . it is a wonderful b movie experience , that rips deliciously into the spy film genre and comes away with a bundle of laughs for all its awkwardness and a ridiculous ending to a story that fails to make much sense . i think chabrol hit it best , when the opening epigraph states , "" i do not ask you to believe it , but i suggest that you dream about it . "" well , maybe , you don't want to dream about it , but if you daydream about it during the time of day when you are a little bored with things or upset over something , the absurdity of this film should bring a smile to you . "
631,"in this movie , that goes beyond the boundaries of what a movie is , because it has become a trademark name that is as easily recognized as any popular brand name is ; if i mentioned kfc , you would know that i am talking about a fast-food chain that sells fried chicken ( ugh ! ) , and if i mentioned star wars ( ah ! ) , the same familiarity would ring a bell with you . since the movie first surfaced in 1977 , it has been a very popular film , basically over-taking many other types of films that took on the moral battle of good and evil , such as the western , and it created a new myth that does not challenge the old myth , but incorporates pieces of mythology not only from the judeo-christian roots of the bible , but from the eastern religions , as well . it has become so commercially successful a film and enterprise , that even though the film cost about 115 million dollars to make , its profit margin is a sure thing , since it has merchandise deals tied into its release , that are estimated to be around 3 . 5 billion dollars . with this in mind , there can be no ordinary viewing of this film , since it is already hyped and promoted beyond any reasonable level of expectation , it is therefore hardly likely that it could meet such expectations , even with its fanatical fan base , willing to stand on long lines for a long time in order to get tickets and who will most likely see the film a number of a times , and a public that is primed and ready for the product . how many times will viewers want to see it , is hard to gauge at this early date , though what is guaranteed , is that it will draw large crowds and pump life into the movie industry , as many will see this film as an event , therefore making it critic-proof and ensured of being a legendary film no matter what might be perceived of it on screen . what takes place on screen , if i can consider myself , a voice of moderation on this subject , is not as terrible a storyline and acting job as one could be led to believe by listening to some film critics , nor is it as great a film as many unabashed fans might think , who feel taken with the innovative special-effects , and are really caught up in the aura and excessive exuberance the total film's package presents to them , from john william's recognizable star war themes , to some original musical scores he added , as special for the film . there should be something in this film for everybody to like , especially in a thx theater , where the digital sound system and wide screen is best suited for viewing it . the tremendous effort put into the details and scope of its project , makes it seem stupendous at times , and , even throughout the film , when there are lulls in its story , it still sets a very galactic mood , that is trance-like and illusionary in a positive hypnotic sense , but it does suffer , at times , from being too talky and lacking enough emotions and depth in its story and in its characters , and is scripted with a banal dialogue , plus there is no romance in it , which makes it a film that is more geared to a younger audience , an audience that will be around to follow all the other episodes that will surely come forth . as a positive feature of the film , it is not interested in gratuitous violence , and for that it scores high marks , as there is no blood in it , as all the action scenes involve mostly robotic things being dismantled . the pace of the film picks up with its most innovative addition , an exciting and , i might add , dizzying racing sequence featuring "" pod "" space ships , as ani has to win the race to gain freedom for himself and for the jedis to get their needed space craft parts , as a wager is made with ani's junkman boss on the pod race . this is pure video game stuff , that should thrill its younger audience , perhaps more than it did me , but it was effective and added something new to the star wars legend . delving into the evil nature of politics , there is the dual role played by ian mcdiarmid , as senator palpatine/darth sidious , cast perfectly as a shadowy villain and a hypocritical senator , who in future episodes will become emperor palpatine and should provide more chills for viewer's to reckon with . without its frightening villains , star wars would be stripped of its soul . some of the actors did not impress me enough as the above mentioned . it is probably not fair and not nice to criticize a youngster like jake lloyd who plays anakin skywalker , but i thought , that though he was sometimes bearable to see on the screen , as when he played with his computer toys , he was , nevertheless , miscast and did not have the skills to pull off the difficult role he was asked to fulfill . anikin's mother , the great swedish actress , pernilla august , is just right for the part ; in fact , she is too good for the part , because she makes the boy seem very amateurish and not caring enough when he is teamed with her and can't respond with the proper emotional responses expected from his role , while she is fluid and graceful in her role , even though she is stuck in a wooden part . there were non-distinguished cameos by samuel l . jackson and terrence stamp , that have neither added nor distracted anything from the film . i would have preferred seeing unknown actors in those minor roles , giving them a chance to get known and earn some "" bread . "" some of the more exciting scenes , that weren't crammed too tight with every computerized gizmo lucas could throw at us , so that we were literally choking on too much alien and droid consumption , came from the just gorgeous and eye pleasing set designs on the planets , such as the submerged underwater city on naboo , filled with dangerous sea monsters , and a coliseum-like stadium on tatooine , where the "" pod race "" transpired , covered by talking head sport's personalities . its soaring skyscrapers and a sky filled with exotic spaceships and its views of the world , that was just too stunning to fully grasp . all these space landscapes gave the film all the color and spectacle it could ever need , making it a most entertaining and enjoyable movie experience , which is really what this movie is all about anyway , since i find it difficult to get too worked up over its so called "" new mythology , "" joseph campbell blessed or not , since this movie only expresses what is just a shell of what myths can mean to a society . be that it as it may , i do understand that many feel that what is missing in today's society , is some kind of positive myth , that there is something that has gone wrong with our culture , and this film does offer some encouragement for those who feel movies have caused a certain amount of degeneracy in this country's cultural war , and they should be pleased that lucas's film reasserts , his personal belief , that good can triumph over evil , as many feel restless and unsure about the world they live in and need reassurance that we have the same positive values other generations of americans have had , and they should look forward to seeing a film such as this one , that has such a rosy outlook . it is a movie about the taming of nature in the future but made for the age we live in , and will be remembered by future movie viewers , not for its trite dialogue , but as a step up the ladder in our technical and computer skills , and in our deep yearnings to find hope in the world we live in . it seems regretable that we have to wait three more years for the next installment of these episodes to be released . i would say that this imperfect film , is still , a not-to-be missed film , and even if it has become tied-in with corporate america , nevertheless , george lucas used his great technical skills to make this film as artistically good looking as he could , not aiming to make an exploitive film . and for that , we should all be grateful . i have immensely enjoyed the film for what it was and was not overly concerned about what it was not . i think it is fair to say , that when you plunk down your money and see this film , you will be getting your money's worth . "" may the force be with you ! "" "
632,"in it he questions american values , suggesting that it is better to lose and be a nice person than to win and stand for nothing but your own self-aggrandizement . she becomes the easily recognizable villain in payne's satire of american society . makes harelik's love for her seem highly improbable . paul is one of those rich kids who is very nice and very popular , but who is not a very sophisticated or manipulative person . in some ways , this film reminded me of two diverse recent films i saw , welcome to the dollhouse and rushmore . they all had an anger to them , pointing at something in society that is not all that it appears to be and saying that is where the problem lies . in this screenplay , by payne and jim taylor , it has accurately captured a certain look and feel high school has about it . this film was able to show how its school was not conducive for the individual to feel free in . that all the characters are flawed , unable to see beyond the very narrow limits they operate under has made for a very trying tale . the film just didn't know how to end its story by landing on its feet . it had a great performance by matthew broderick , who was subtle and obvious enough to bring out the inner and outer conflicts in his life . yet , the main problem remaining is that aside from the flaws of all the characters involved , there is no one else to blame for the moral dilemma that is presented . "
633,"it is adapted from a semi-autobiographical book written as a teenager in the '50s , for a national literary contest , by john kennedy toole . when this slow-moving film works , and it often does , it is artistically and subtly satisfying to behold , as it spins its simple story in flashback . all this drama is played out quietly . the the film ends abruptly and magnificently , without a summation of what might happen to david . how this child grew up during that period of transitional southern history , in a climate of racial bigotry and christian hypocrisy , in a family with obvious economic , psychological , and cultural problems , sets the mood for this dramatic story . the cinematography was beautifully done . gena rowlands was impressive in a very subtle performance . jacob tierney as david , gave his character softness and breath in a laconic performance . the only problem i have with his performance , is that since this is his life story being told , he seems to be too emotionless . i found that hard to fathom ; if it was me on that nighttime train , alone , going to who knows where , as my brief life passes before me , i would have certainly been more animated about the situation i was in . this film is not davies' best film , it was too dull at times for that ; but , it is a solid film , an honestly done effort that was well-researched and presented . it offered an interesting observation about the rural south , that is often filmed , but most of the time , it is done with less tact than how it was done here and with less of a real artistic touch . "
634,"but how else can you explain billy as anything but absurd . some people call that love . the film throws its bowling ball into the gutter a few times , as it belabors its points about sexual repression and phobias . she is the best character in this film . the comedic edge to the story works well , though at times the film is too arty . it is as if , vincent , as the director , is trying to beat us over the head with the point he is making about billy's life being a constant foul-up . . . this is an uneven but successful film debut for vincent , both as a director and as a star . "
635,"skarsgard's chilling performance does a pyschological number on his character , and the mysterious and soberly colorful norwegian atmosphere gives this film an appealing flavor , allowing it to appear as if were a noir film . this more than makes up for the less than appealing story line . it is worth a look , if for no other reason , than to see how a murder is handled in a beautiful and idyllic country such as norway . but this film has more to offer than that ; it seriously questions police conduct and authority , as it leaves a very damaging message , something that is hard to ignore about authority figures the world-over : questioning if the police are mentally fit for the work they do . "
636,"and that's the gist of the plot for this sophisticated and superbly acted romance story , that turns the tables on the old notion that the man controls the destiny of the household . because of the expressiveness and raw emotions of the stars , as they go through all kinds of mood swings and power plays until they resolve this very ticklish and perplexing problem they face , we are confronted with a situation whereas pierre has done nothing ghastly to ruin the marriage and the couple still profess a love for each other , yet they are undergoing a separation . his quiet manner , hurt expression , and look of bewilderment says it all . "" in a couple , one suffers and the other one's bored , and vice versa . "" it now becomes a question if they can weather this storm and the bitterness that is so much a part of their love . a pivotal scene is when the verbal fighting , accusations and hitting take place , that was really unexpected from this urbane couple , except we see it building up and festering inside the stricken pierre . the director wisely doesn't give us too much information about her lover or the details of their love life . that more or less sums up the direction the director was going with this one , by trying to explain the imponderable reason for the snag in their marriage due to a lack of communication . this is an intelligent film , told from the point of view of the man , though this film is not as powerful as paul cox's similar type of film "" my first wife . "" its huge plus , however , is that it avoids the use of cliches usually reserved for explaining why a couple is breaking up and plays up the small petty things in a relationship that strain one's nerves . this marriage-go-round leaves us off in familiar territory . most of us know how it feels to be unsure of someone we love . and it stings . this work is a testament to a confused couple who are sensible enough to face things that are unpleasant to them in a forthright manner without covering it up . it is only the real good directors , as evidently christian vincent is , who can pull off such an imbroglio with everything turning out to be in a daze for them ; but , nevertheless , ending up intact .

637,"this is werner herzog's first feature and is easily his most conventional story to date ; which , nevertheless , results in a rather interesting drama even if it is a somewhat heavy handed metaphoric one when it relates the mental breakdown of stroszek to the irrationality of war . there is nothing for the soldiers to do on this barren island , with its torrid greek sun bearing down on them , which makes their stay here seem like an imprisonment . but he is going off on lethargic mood swings , where he can't function for long periods at a time . but the soldiers don't buy into his story , even though his life story is probably more real than theirs . when a piano player plays chopin and tells them how chopin was really mean in his music contrary to the way most interpret his work , we see for ourselves how this music seems to have a dizzying affect on stroszek , who is beginning to show some serious signs of cracking . herzog's characters exhibited many bizarre touches that made them full of life , certainly different from any american film about nazi soldiers . these soldiers seemed like flawed human beings , trapped by the environment they were in and their own idiosyncratic nature , all of which made this ordinary film seem rather special and well-worth taking note of . "
638,"it is a most relaxed and enjoyable look at the neurotic comic , who appears to be no different than he is in his films . but what is vividly shown , is how exhilerated he gets from playing the clarinet and how wonderfully morbid he is about everything he does , from eating a vulcanized spanish omelet in spain to getting seasick on a gondola in venice . you can't help but realize that this is really woody , it is not a put on , and you either love him or shy away from him . some of the snippets from the numbers he played included the joyous songs like "" down by the riverside "" and "" home sweet home . "" if there is any criticism for the film , it could be noted that we didn't hear enough of the band playing . there are good vibes there , as they all seem to be on the same page . what might be surprising to a lot of people , is how good the band actually is and how much fun they seem to have playing together . that he receives an engraved plaque for this , encourages woody to joke about how it comes easy for him to be a hero . woody comments that he is always wants to be somewhere he isn't , if he is in milan , he wants to be in new york , if he is in new york , he might want to be in paris . "
639,"the title comes from the markings found on packages delivered by the postal service . the inspiration of the film comes from the studio-like hollywood musicals of the '50s . his other influences are the great french directors of the past , such as renoir and vigo . i rented up down fragile , along with rivette's first feature , paris belongs to us ( 1960 ) , and it was interesting to see how rivette kept some of the same themes , how one has the need to be alone and also the need to be with a group , how one handles reality and fantasy , and the politics of being . in his newer film , which was stylistically and cinematically a much more sophisticated and well-done production than the former , we see these themes come out clearer , brought out by a director who is more assured of his abilities to work with actors on a more experimental basis , as they each collaborate on the script , as he gets them to improvise in their roles . the film follows the life of its three main characters : ninon ( natashe ) , louise ( marianne ) , and ida ( laurence ) , as they try to work out their many problems in life , occasionally breaking out in song and dance at the oddest moments , even when the film is moving along in a dramatic fashion . this lighthearted approach to the film annoyed me on my first viewing , but when i watched the film for a second time , i felt more relaxed and was able to get in the mood rivette probably intended for his film to be viewed ; which is , that it is up to me to fill in the meaning of the story . but , this also , allowed me not to take this film as a very serious work but more or less as a spectacle in the hollywood tradition , a tradition that rivette gladly acknowledges a kinship and admiration for . its entertainment value was enhanced by the gorgeous use of colors , which captured the summertime paris streets and parks , as well as the beautful indoor sets . we followed the moped messenger , ex-whore , ninon , do her deliveries . that this musical is better than most of the hollywood musicals it flatteringly immitates , is true to a certain extent . it is better in the sense , that rivette is able to bring out the poetry of the real-life situations and present his existential view of life and not just play for the song and dance to be the thing . though the hollywood performers are more professional and have better voices and quicker feet , is certainly true , but they also , seem to rely on an artificial story . while for rivette , as amateur as his performers might seem to be in comparison , the story still seems real and important , and the musical numbers are intrusive but seem to be imbued with a magical quality about them , that makes them seem just as fantasy oriented as the typical hollywood production ; and , in my opinion , that makes for a more interesting and better film . though it makes for a different way for american audiences to appreciate the musical , a form of film that hollywood at one time was the most innovative creators of , but has now all but abandoned that genre because of high production costs and not enough box office gross to show for its efforts . "
640,"the movie is a mixture of their music , lifestyles , and an apolitical , quick peek at an impoverished havana . it is done in a wonderfully nostalgic manner , as wenders becomes an admiring fan of theirs , allowing us to see how humble and human these most talented musical souls are . wenders has done a good job highlighting them , though i would have liked to have seen more of their music as performed in carnegie hall , instead of seeing an overabundance of shots showing how well they were received there and how appreciative they were of that rousing welcome . he didn't even own a piano before the film was made . their genuine camaraderie for each other and love of country and gentleness , shines through as much as all the wonderful music they play . fire ! i'm burning up . call the fireman ! they tell each other , it doesn't get any better than this . i wonder how much longer castro's communist revolution will go on ! "
641,"one of the better sci-fi'ers to emerge from the 1950s . the only part of the film that is in color , is the red letters of the title . no money is taken , only sugar . go figure its ants that did this ! so you can't blame sgt . since the girl's father was a f . b . i . agent on vacation , this makes it a federal crime and the f . b . i . it is these constant little touches throughout the film , more so than the special effects , that make this film come to life . this film was intelligently presented , the special effects were effective enough , and the cast , especially edmund gwenn , all provided fine performances , all this adding up to a really decent and subtle film . "
642,"while at the beauty parlor , she is interviewed for the film , filling us in with a more complete look at lenny , as she provided anecdotes , snapshots and home films of him and recalled how he was a quiet child who could have fits of melancholy , but was a happy-go-lucky person most of the time . he also made what he calls a z- film with his wife and friends , a funny low-budget crime film that showed he basically was like the other comics , willing to do anything for a laugh . and that , even though , he had the comedian mentality of just going after the laugh , he was still able to develop into being something more than your typical comedian . it became his obsession in life and caused this once slick hipster to sadly be seen losing his cool demeanor . lenny felt , "" it's become chic to arrest me . '' please don't lock up these words . "" "
643,"the film was powerful enough in its political jibes to have made the state and the church and the opposition party condemn it . though this is not the director's top-of-the line artistic work , it does fit positively into his opus . it seemed awkward and out of place in this straight forward film , whose darkened cameras captured enough of the sobering mood of poland for the story to be a compelling one , a story about the unfinished business of the struggle for freedom . "
644,"the b/w film starts off fast-paced and never stops to catch its breath . this comes about after there is an actual lineup in the film , as all the ship's porters are brought in so that dressler could identify the one who threw his luggage in the cab . but since the rather snooty dressler was not observant of these lower-class types , he was unable to pick the porter out of the lineup . these two psychopaths are real beauties , and give the film the kind of quirkiness that keeps its brutal scenes counterbalanced with a nice edge of verbal nastiness . warner's last words , duly noted for julian's benefit are , "" why be greedy ? "" this film is not noteworthy for its sadistic story , but what makes it rise above the ordinary b movie , is the strangely provocative dialogue and the utter depravity of all the criminals , who are shown in all their ugliness and unredeeming features . the outcome shows that they can't rise to another social level despite all their efforts to polish dancer's image . "
645,"a great labyrinth plot , ala hitchcock , as mamet delves into the greedy corporate world and its nasty secrets of espionage and bitter competition , and dangles this world in front of us , with all its perks and glitter and hopes for money being the big payoff for these corporate types . this nearly perfectly executed film , never fails to surprise and it accomplishes this by telling an old-fashioned story without one explicit sex scene or one single curse word , earning it a pg rating . the chink in the story's armor is , when you see how it ends , you realize it doesn't add up . the fun seems to be in the telling of the story and not in the story itself making sense . this is a masterfully crafted thriller for the '90s and its new values and lingo . steve martin ( that's right , pal ) steals the film with his stellar performance mixing affable charm and dark mystery to hide his persona . this something , 'the process , ' is what should put him figuratively on 'easy street . ' 'the process' is a mcguffin , a hitchcock invented term , it is something to focus your attention on without knowing what it really is . its explanation for the movie is that it has something to do with a formula that can control the global market . but what mamet really is showing , is greed and how that poisonous desire makes the world spin . this is pointed out when the board members of a company want to know how much they will earn from investing in it and joe writes the supposed astronomical figure on a blackboard , which the audience is not privileged to see but is supposed to be impressed by it through the response taken from watching the widening eyes of the board members . this pulls him very close to the audience , as they identify with him and his situation , even if it is hardly possible that they themselves would ever be in such a position . this is the kind of hero that speaks realistically to what could happen to anyone in today's work place , especially to someone who doesn't play the corporate game , and who doesn't know that the first axiom in business for the dishonest types , is always do business as if someone is trying to screw you . in this film , it has nothing to do with spain or a prisoner . this tale is more frightening than a hundred action films put together . it is eerie because the innocent hero asks , during one of his low points , "" why steal what others worked for ? "" it is a film that earnestly asks , `why is it that nobody in this world is what they seem ? ' has mamet really ended the film by tying up all the loose ends and leaving us with the kind of ending we as an audience wanted ? and the answer is . . . maybe . this is a film for people who like to use their noodle and are able to appreciate films that can't be tidied up so easily . even the so-called tidy ending here might not be as tidy as it first appears , if you look carefully you will spot some loose ends . "
646,"in his forceful and blunt way , hiding his violent tendencies with the warmest smile in st . petersburg , he professes to have a real romantic interest in her , sincerely sympathizing with her that men are often beating her up . she seems to so passively accept her beatings as part of her life , which i guess is symbolic of how russia treats its women . everything that we learn about the new russian attitudes comes from seeing it through danila's naive eyes . this scene for one thing tells how xenophobic the russians have always been and still are . his mindlessness and quiet charm , and the heroic qualities he often displays , are both chilling and pitiful to observe . if anything , this slickly done gangster thriller , should be taken as a political warning by the west that russia is a wounded animal and still dangerous , and a wounded animal is frightened and will often do anything to lash out at those it perceives as hurting it . there were many diverting scenes that make that point crystal clear . his performance gives the film a reverberating force , depicting the chaos currently going on in a deteriorating country , and how difficult it would be to reach someone like him , when he can be so deceptive by just smiling and so distant by tuning out what he doesn't want to hear . it is in his soul that rests the centuries of russia's life of misery and war , whose struggle is never over but always seems to be just beginning . he has infused the film with a raw power , that touches the nerves of the things that westerners understand the least about the russians . all this makes for a fascinating film , one that is popular in russia , and is quite different from the usual russian films exported to america . it is one of the most insightful films i have seen about modern russia and how organized crime has taken a foothold in the country . it is a film that has its finger on the problems the severe economic decay in russia and the rise of criminals to fill the void of a lost morality , has caused . this film has the look and tone of those old american b movies , but with a little more depth in its political aims and much more pessimism for its country'sfuture . "
647,"so it is with rohmer , who in actuality might not be such an exacting realist as first thought , but more of an artist who happens to be a realist , perhaps in the mode of a monet , whose artistic work is appreciated because his water lilies mean more to him and should to us than just the flowers they are . this is a very ordinary love story between middle-aged lonely people who are unable to make a connection with someone else , even though they are people who have a lot to give and are far from being losers . for rohmer , being moral is simply living as simply as one would : being natural . being a french film , it is very chatty . it also takes a long time to develop as it makes sure that we understand all the people involved and what kind of philosophy about life they have , before we come to the crux of the story . how the people speak and how they react to the ordinary things in life , is really what rohmer is interested in . it is what gives this film its flavor and distinguishes its director from others of the french new wave , of which he is a part of . to watch a rohmer film like he intended it to be observed , is to take in the magnificence of the natural , whether it is the opening of the film when we are introduced to the town's older white buildings , as the light falls against them and contrasts its whiteness with its black shadows or if we view the verdant fall colors of the countryside and its sense of a cultivated peace as the sun shines on it . this sense of beauty has stood the test of time and is worth savoring . but her matchmaking doesn't work because there is no chemistry them . what is most endearing about the film , even if it is a bourgeois tale , is that it has a french charm to it and a deep-seated respect for all the people involved . that the amorous professor and the playful and impulsive rosine and the dull leo are shown in equal terms with the industrious magali and the elegant isabelle and the sincere salesman g ? rald , which is a sly way of telling the story in a non-judgmental way . there's much to recommend in this film that feels right and touches a sore subject that should interest mostly those in their forties and later years of life ; what the story lacks is a great deal of imagination and a something more substantial in it to make the modest story have something more to say than it does . the film only goes so far in being realistic before it has to resort to farcical contrivances to keep our interests . but even if it is not always interesting , it does keep us on our toes rooting for the nice winemaker to come up with something more than a bumper crop . this was rohmer's fourth and final film about the seasonal cycle , and it might be the best one , letting in the most sunlight and being very pleasurable to watch , highlighted by fine acting by all concerned . by the time the film ends , we have the feeling that we really know these individuals , it is as if we met them in real life and they have become our acquaintances . "
648,"the children , despite their discontentments with the outside world , are almost mirror images of their empty parents , unwilling to be honest with themselves , or too honest with themselves for their own good . the ice storm is magnificently opulent in its whitish , blueish , and gray colors ( the ice was artificially made , but it looks only too real ) . it symbolically represents the truth that can't be denied , no matter what games the adults ( wife-swapping ) and children ( touching their private parts ) play . the beauty of the ice storm is even more menacing and attractive when it is added to the more placid beauty of the town's countryside ; but it is also dangerous , as we see how the one surbanite truly influenced by the beauty of the storm , also succumbs to it . it is amazing that this film was made by a foreigner , who is able to get into some of the nuances that pricked the skin of those living through those times ( it still surprises me , though hollywood has a rich history of foreigners doing just that , examples would be , messieurs lang and sirk ) . the characters are intricately drawn together , but each is complex and not reduced to being a caricature . ricci's performance is simply breathtaking in its verve , as she appears to be the only one of the teen group who really feels what is going on politically and socially . this film is to be admired for its vividly icy observations of suburban life , letting us clearly see the intensity and restlessness that lies behind the carefully manicured personas of the rich . its use of the ice storm's raw power , in all its beauty and danger , as a metaphor on the dysfunctionality of the characters , were both well-utilized and , at the same time , utilized too much . the ice storm came to symbolize what can so easily be taken away from any one , in one rapid moment , if one is not prudent or careful in their life . the film can be slightly faulted for putting too much weight on the ice storm and its symbolical message , and for trying to make too much of the comparison between the children and the parents , thereby not doing enough justice to either , as the characterizations tended to appear to be too forced into fitting in with the metaphor of the ice storm . "
649,"a delightful screwball comedy , making use of sci-fi gimmicks to bolster its story . willie plays the role with rolling eyeballs and other gestures that smack of a stereotyped racism that is upsetting to many of today's african-americans . when willie sees the invisible man , he exclaims , "" well , cut off my legs and call me shorty . "" this 72 minute film is the kind of old-fashioned comedy that can cheer you up with a few laughs if you are down , or if you are in a silly mood make you feel even sillier . it's a classic . "
650,"my sex life ( or how to get into an argument ) [comment je me suis dispute . . . some might find this appealing film about parisian twenty-somethings , who refuse to grow up , to be quite amusing . these troubled student-intellectual types love to talk and are charmingly neurotic , in a film that unjustifiably goes on for three hours but does so in a surprisingly breezy fashion . i would have more carefully edited this film , as there were too many scenes that were nice but not impactful enough to keep . what the film does just right , that caught my interest from a psychological point of view : is penetrate the students' loneliness , the mind-games they play , their ideas about sex and love , their foolish need to lie , and the tribal nature of their relationships . these sort of devilish characters could be very attractive to the opposite sex , especially if they are handsome like he is and equipped with a facade of sensitivity and innate intelligence . you see , he thinks he loves another girl even more , sylvia ( denicourt ) , whose performance steals the film because of her unwitting sexual charm being displayed in such a capricious manner . nathan does not know that he knew sylvia before , which should tell you something about their close friendship . this really fine ensemble cast takes this meandering , real-life type of a story and makes it into an absorbing drama , carefully scrutinizing their intricate and confusing lives . val ? rie is very demanding , and suffers from being a bit metally unbalanced . jeanne balibar gives an eye-catching performance , one that adds just the right degree of spice to the meal being cooked . there are a few diverting subplots that are deftly handled by the director , as paul is snubbed by his pretentious ex-friend rabier ( vuillermoz ) , who becomes to his chagrin , head of the epistemology department at the university . what the film fails to do , after one may grow weary of all the charm it exudes , is provide any rationalizations or explanations for the split-ups and ongoing relationships . there are no shared intimacies , or greater emotional or intellectual depths explored . but the film is still a rather compelling and superbly acted-out black comedy , that has its glorious moments , but cannot go past its own facile limits it set-for- itself . "
651,"it is a politically oppressive climate in the madrid of the 1970s , with the dictator franco in power . there are too many coincidences for me to be wholly convinced that i am not being manipulated into accepting a story with a certain political agenda to it , but there are so many wonderful gripping and beautifully done scenes , that i found i was taken in by the relationships going on and curious about what would happen to these folks , and glad that almodovar ( dark habits , high heels , women on the verge of a nervous breakdown ) has chosen to make a film this time that has a story that makes some sense . i found most of his other films to be basically sexually bizarre , with storylines that were not particularly lucid . clara , who is only a minor figure in this story , nevertheless , her story is the one that moved me the most . his story is the most challenging one , and the one that is hardest to comprehend . almodovar has shot a sophisticated film about characters who really develop character-wise and who are in-tune with the times they live in . this film is definetly one of almodovar's more resolute efforts . "
652,"and , still other secrets that have a greater implication for the world and are deadly in a political sense , of science carried out by the big corporations like it was a business run for the bottom line . in the dinner scene that was , unfortunately , flatly done , but was nevertheless the heart of the film , as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat , a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything . the scientists engage in a rational argument , highlighting their different points of view , while lillian reacts in an emotional way , siding mostly with david's view but coming at it from a much different angle . it was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies . that the director's point of view is absolutely right , is beside the point . the point is that the characters lost their humanity and became one-dimensional characters . what can one expect out of life ? the answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art , which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way . that this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions , leaving no room for deeper arguments , is the shame of this decent and smart film , that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white . no telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in ; it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic . there is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me , as i don't like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically . that is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit , that inspite of its shortcomings , it was worth seeing because of its visual statements , though they were also not too subtle , they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently , of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them , and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference . perhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film , was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene . "
653,"she has not planned things out too carefully , having no money , and the trip doesn't seem like it's much fun , more like a misadventure , with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in . but this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here . in this film , the subject of drugs is never broached , only hinted at in an off-handed but slurring way , as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light , strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken . it is written by the director's brother , who has previously directed regeneration , the playboys , and trojan eddie . the title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls . this scene didn't make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation , unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people , also . but i doubt that . the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet , as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes , expansive views , illustrious mosques , and grand sunsets . the background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane , provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film . the film's weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor ( she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation ) and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia . she perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along , smoking some hashish , and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn't have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey . the film's strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are , and no one is that good or that bad , or judged too harshly for their shortcomings . bilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity . julia , the cornerstone the film is built on , is a mother who cares about the children but doesn't know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them . this is a very freudian way to look at things , as this sudden realization , that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey , at least , for the time being . and , after all is said and done , who's to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences , just like she probably was ! "
654,"racial hatred is something that we are not born with . films of this nature are very difficult to do ; firstly , because they tend to become merely message vehicles and , secondly , hatred is a mindset that must be unlearned and films tend to think that they must sermonize to get their good intentions across and sermons as a rule do not make for pleasing dramatics . when this film is most effective , it goes for the jugular of its racist veins and pulls back no punches , using lucid arguments about why there is racial disharmony in this country and it does so in the language used on the street . when it backtracks and feels that it has to explain itself and sort of apologize for what it has shown , and allows the main character off the racial hook rather abruptly , the story seems to weaken and become somewhat artificial like so many other films of this ilk , afraid to let completely go and allow the chips to fly where they may . what the producers of the film might be afraid of , is that the message about why youngsters become racists was too convincingly done , that their gripes are too reasonable and might leave a bitter taste in the mouths of those who can't face the realities of life in contemporary america . that this is a country where so many of the nasty newspaper headlines seem to be about racial problems ; and , also , this is a country that is consumed by its bad karma from its past racial history to its unsettling now and it is thereby impossible to hide from these problems wherever one lives in this country . this film convincingly exploits this racial tension , up to a point , as it tantalizes the audience with a reality that is lived out for real in many of the viewer's everyday lives , as many of them are the innocent ones caught in the cross-fire of those extreme racists on both sides of the color line . so one of the questions that crosses my mind , is what can this film add to our knowledge of hatred that would make us feel we are onto some way of dealing with it any better than we have until now ? perhaps it is an unfair or an unanswerable question and not the purpose of any film to do , but after seeing so much ugliness on screen , using gang violence , race baiting attitudes , and the polarization of the races to make its point about the current social crisis , it makes one wonder what is the method to unlearning the hatred learned , especially when all the great religious leaders and artists and philosophers could only reach those who were convinced already that hatred was wrong and couldn't change the world into an harmonious place , even if their message was an eloquent and a correct one . i expect this film will actually be relished for its provocative stance and its real sense of hatred it was able to duplicate in those white or black punks committing the violence , with the extreme views of hatred outweighing any other message the film was trying to deliver . and that is the beauty of the film ; the real lesson it puts on the table , the one that must be confronted ; it is what makes this film invaluable and genuine , a documentary-style look at racism . in britisher tony kaye's debut feature , after a successful career in doing tv commercials , he brings some of the attention getting scenes that commercials use to reach the consumer and has come up with a riveting film that paints a necessary ugly racial picture in bold black-and-white photography during some of its more graphically violent scenes . but the director was not satisfied with the finished product , claiming that the film's star , edward norton , re-edited the final version giving himself more screentime and that the studio themselves changed the film so that it could be more acceptable to a greater audience . the film did have an incomplete look to it and its ending did seem to be missing something , as there appeared to be holes in the story and the film ended too abruptly to make sense . nevertheless , the director did a good job , this is a provocative film and it is one that is grounded in reality and will be remembered for its powerful images of hatred . this was the hardest part of the film to swallow whole , especially when the change comes about so rapidly and the film did not do a good enough job storywise of showing how this change could be internally possible . what excelled though , was the acting , especially by norton , who understood his role and got the most out of it . this part of the story was too incredulous and sketchy for it to be anything but a well-intentioned but misguided effort at making everything turn out to be pat . dr . sweeney was also too sketchy a characterization for the film to feel fluid . he seemed to be placed there to provide the film with a safe way out of its difficult dilemma it dug for itself regarding the extremity of race relations . but it was just that extremity and its rawness that gave the film the kind of edge to it that made it potent . she is solid . in her small part- it's too bad she wasn't given more to say , she outshines the arguments against hatred presented by her weak mother , the ineffective murray , and the too good to be real principal . the most obvious flaw of the film , is that derek's ultra right-wing arguments against liberals and how the blacks are ruining the country , never get answered back in a satisfactory way . there is no one to speak up for what most people in america think is fair . and so when the tragic ending to the film takes place , what is there to say ! we have seen the worst about america , how herd-like certain people can behave and how the prison and the venice beach that is depicted both lump people into groups because of race . but if this is the current reality , then there are certainly alternative realities , where different human beings can live together in peace , which the film tried to show through dr . sweeney's presence , but that didn't work because his actions seemed too contrived . it is too bad that derek couldn't see how rotten his ideas were in time , maybe his intelligence wasn't all that it was cracked up to be . he didn't seem like he was a criminal or the typical dumb skinhead type , but he seemed as if he was someone who got confused over his bad ideas and didn't know what else to do . in my opinion , the film didn't really capture the mindset of the neo-nazi wholly , it just peeked in on them and was starting to zero in on their psyche and why they become skinheads and what makes them exit from being one , but it ended up by just lumping them together with all the other sterotyped groups and failed to go far enough in showing us what makes them , in particular , tick . there just seemed to be too much ground this film was trying to cover and it just couldn't adequately cover the entire history of contemporary racism without turning the film into a documentary . but this is still a quality film , that is both visually powerful and disturbing , showing how much dirt there is to bring up about america's ever-present racial problems . i just wish the film didn't give us an entire year's history curriculum about racism in two hours . if it didn't back off from its characterization of derek and danny , and if it kept hitting the sore points in society that ordinary people find hard to talk about without getting overwrought or emotionally racial about , we might have had a great film . the potential for this good film to be much better than it was , was certainly there for the taking . i guess all we can do is wait for his next film and see what he does with that one before we can fully accept his argument for what went wrong here , but let me praise him and the fine supporting cast for what was right about the film , which was most of the film .

655,"raising arizona ( director/writer : joel coen ; screenwriter : ethan coen ; cinematographer : barry sonnenfeld ; cast : nicolas cage ( h . a very funny spoof about a colorful couple who must have a child and will try to get one by any means possible . through the use of a voiceover , emanating from h . i . as the narrator , the logical sequence of the story is followed . the film has its moments of serious pauses , as h . i . there are a few more complications along the way , as h . i . here the comedy was predictable chevy chase sort of material . the coen brothers know how to make a quirky film and they sure know how to write side-splitting dialogue . and if you are looking for something heavier , like a lesson to be gotten from all this or a searing comment on society , maybe you could even find that here also . though sometimes the comic situations and the way all the characters talk funny , seem forced , it still recovers from these lapses and bounces back with more off-the-wall situations once reserved for "" keystone cop "" comedies , like ferocious dogs chasing the hero , improbable victories for our improbable hero while fighting goliaths , and store clerks who have hidden vengeance inside them . if it is absurd comedy that makes you do cartwheels , something that is unique and dark enough to have some bite in it , then this film is funny enough to overcome some of its failing moments .

656,"this directorial debut for kitano ( hana-bi/sonatine ) is a visual stunner in unmitigated violence . the "" violent cop "" is as violent and gratuitously violent of an entertaining film as i have ever seen . but even as the chief lectures him that he is too wild , he has to admit that he is effective in getting the job done . it's an action flick that questions one's sensibilities and has enough original twists in the story to keep you guessing how many of the cops are corrupt and what method will be used to kill off the yakuza members . there was something very likable about kitano's monster cop that might be hard to rationalize , but it does draw him close to the audience in a surprising way . if you like your violence with a dose of some intelligent dramatics thrown in for good measure , you should find this flawlessly well-paced film satisfying to some degree . but you better have a strong stomach for violence and how ridiculous this story is , built around titillating the audience with an abnormal display of graphic violence . "
657,"it is always fascinating when a great foreign director takes a look at his own country in a way that outsiders can't really see it . he seems to have their best interest at heart and he cures them of their ills , and they know this , but the ones in charge don't seem to care and treat him as if he were a quack . i have not read the book to confirm this but this is what the director said in an interview that was reported by a film 'zine . what struck me as rather odd for the moment , until i thought further about it , was the film's opening , as the first words spoken are english that come from american bomber pilots flying over okayama , an island village next to the doctor's hometown of hibi , with a pow camp and a factory . this seems to indicate the influence america and its film industry has had on this quintessential japanese director and the need he has to show that the world is not necessarily a homogenous place , that all nations are influenced by each other . it is a rather odd philosophical opinion for one to have , especially for one who was himself getting bombed during the war ( imamura was a teen at the time of the war ) . no one in this film will get exactly what they want . this is a chaotic story that covers more topics than you could shake a stick at . this imamura film is not by any means his definitive one , but it shows enough of his lifetime concerns to be an interesting one for him to make his swan song in . what it suffers from is that the combination of comedy and serious drama have too many awkward and slow moments , that show many reactions to what the director visibly feels and makes them look as if they were predictably put into the cluttered story and don't have a breath of their own . to see how great a director he is , is to contrast those tepid scenes with some of the scenes that have his magical hand in it and see how simple and moving they were . there is no moral judgment that this is an american bomb , as it seems the philosophy here is , that when you live by the sword you must expect to die that way . the better choice for his country would have been one of practising a more loving nature , something that seems obvious , but what is also obvious is that the world has not learned that simple lesson and continues to rely on military might to fight its battles . in one conversation between akagi and sonoko , the beauty of their characters is magnified , as the deadly bacteria is viewed under the microscope and sonoko on seeing it , exclaims how beautiful it is : sonoko : "" are there men and women bacteria ? "" akagi : "" neither male nor female , just perpetual reproductive motion . "" "" that doesn't exist in nature . more fun . "" this film might not be a masterpiece ( which i don't think it is ) but it is clearly a film by a great man , a man who sees the contradictions in life in an amusing and contentiously cynical way , someone who can put the virtuous doctor in the same boat with the whore , and not be bothered by any moral judgments about who the better person is , because to him they are both beautiful . a strange farcical comedy results , that is often brilliant and at other times too messy to follow in all the cloudy trails it leads to .

658,"the relevance and devastating emotions of the slaves were intelligently presented ; even though , at times , the film was static and seemed to have no legs to get it going in the direction it wanted to be going . yet it still turned out to be a potent and forceful movie . it is hard to be critical of the stand for morality and piety the film makes ; but what saved this picture from being the "" holier than thou self-righteous bomb "" i thought it might have been , were the presence of john quincy adams ( hopkins ) and cinque in the film . without their human emotions , one by his words , the other by his facial expressions , the film would not have been as impactful as it was . there could be only so much that one can take from watching the misery of others , until it would become overbearing and defeat all its good intentions . or else , the film would have been a very difficult one to watch . spielberg is the master of a visual story , and here he is in top form . the carnage and cruelty aboard the slave ship are shockingly and revealingly shot , giving one enough of an idea what the slave had to endure . that gives the film the force and importance that is needed for it to make its moral point . "
659,"talented mr . "" the talented mr . ripley "" offers another screen adaptation of the patricia highsmith novel , the first being rene clement's "" purple noon ( 59 ) , "" a more straight- forward hitchcock type of film that the french actor alain delon couldn't do much with . anthony minghella ( the english patient ) will make the theme of the film into an identity crises problem that ripley has and allow the film to become a character study about a sociopath who can complacently say about himself , "" i always thought it would be better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody . "" he has removed most of the complicated psychological layers of the character and made ripley into a seemingly nicer sort of person , the murder he commits is not premeditated as in the novel but comes about when he is provoked beyond what his fragile nature can take . minghella paints a picturesque view of how these rich americans in the late 1950s live as ugly americans in europe , as the photography is brilliant , with its array of luminous colors , from mediterranean places such as san remo , palermo , roma , and venice . the beautiful scenery , villas , luxurious hotels , and splendid boat rides are just right for getting the audience all excited about taking a look at how the smart-set travel and spend their leisure time . this fits in nicely with the touristy look of the film . but the story , as engrossing as it is , can so easily be forgotten when the film ends . this is a big budget miramax film , not an arthouse personal film . its magnificent look took away any kind of noir intent the novel might have had if the film was done in the pure form it was written in . the film becomes primarily a character study about ripley and not a film that is too concerned about filling all the holes it has in its plot , which are enough to sink a ship . she just seems to be along for the ride- her part is a rather inconsequential one , though it is in the same vein as the tiresome parts she usually stars in , but here we are , at least , spared from seeing tears come down her reddened cheeks . we just see her justifiable petulant anger , as she gives ripley that knowing bitchy look of disapproval , indicating i know what you did to my dickie . ripley's main intent , will be to concentrate on absorbing himself in dickie's personality and to try to ingratiate himself with the womanizing and capricious wastrel- a part that jude does a good job of conveying , as he captures the character's nasty mood swings as well as his goofy flippant side . the scenes with freddie pushed the envelope wide-open and made the average intelligence that ripley possessed diminish in his chilling presence . hoffman's screen presence sparked keen interest in the story and made it seem more powerful when he was onscreen . when he wasn't onscreen , the story wasn't quite as fascinating , which made me wonder if he would have been even more suited to play ripley than the bland damon was . and , even if , there seems to be little sympathy for the idle-rich during ripley's spree , there also becomes less and less sympathy for the psychopathic ripley , who the filmmaker was insidiously trying to get the viewer to identify with . thereby , the film loses touch with the character who falls too far from the graces of any rationality for social acceptance , who is seen drowning in his own lies and trapped in his own guilt-ridden nature . in the novel , ripley is more of a long-range scheming sociopath than he is in the film . the new spontaneous twists in the film changes the mood of the story , and makes it more creepy but not more endearing . i think the reason for that , is because the matt damon part loses the character's rich rebellious flavor and makes him become less an antihero than viewed as a serial murderer . to fully identify with ripley would require the viewer losing himself totally in the character and seeing the world only through ripley's narcissistic eyes , and that is the way minghella probably wanted one to see the film and understand how ripley operated . the problem with that , is it simplified all the dark notions of ripley's character and lightened the burden of the story too much , trying to make it conform with the '90s style of film . as a result , this seductive film comes to a conclusion that failed to live up to the gamesmanship offered throughout most of the story . the film became less meaningful the longer it went on , and it ran for 139- minutes . "
660,"this is a man's film , for the kind of a man who is lost in his sense of being a man and lost in the nostalgia of the '70s drug scene . the women all have minor parts and are viewed as sex objects or conniving harlots . so you see the direction this film is going , it is cartoonish in characterization , with ridiculous dialogue , plenty of zany characters , and no discernible plot . stars make cameo appearances and do their shticks , even if it adds nothing to the plot . the john turturro one , where he plays the flaming mexican queen , is particularly funny . but since "" the dude "" is just being set-up , it really doesn't matter that he is not qualified for the job , even if he does take this job to be a serious one , and his dim observations of things are humorously abetted by his friends even dimmer observation of things , which makes things really seem absurd . the comedy here is sometimes so sharp , that you could roll in the aisle with laughter and not seem any odder than the characters you see onscreen . the john goodman character , of the hot-tempered , ex-soldier , and adage prone advisor to "" the dude , "" is hysterically funny . everything about john goodman's character will apply to his tour of duty there , whether or not it is relevant to the situation . it is not as good a film overall as fargo , but it is funny enough to be a minor work in the coen brothers continuing attack on our sitcom culture . it also added a nice touch by having sam eliott , with his rich melodic voice , garbed as a cowboy , do the voice-over , adding touches of inane wisdom ; such as , his saying in mock seriousness , "" sometimes you get the bear , sometimes the bear gets you . "" this only adds more absurdity , to a story that was already bizarre to begin with . "
661,"what is unconventional about this film is obviously not the plot , we have seen all this before , but the dialogue that is deliciously witty and outrageous , every character in the film has something to say that flies in the face of convention . these are people i wouldn't want to spend quality time with . i certainly would not want to be exchanging barbs with them . but i do find them charming on the screen , as i am able to ignore how inane the dialogue really is and how threadbare the story is , all because there was too much to like about this film to be over critical of it ( i liked tarantino's homage to grier and the '70s , as he plays some delphonics soundtracks and introduces pam's appearance in the film with a '70s soundtrack of bobby womack singing "" across 110th street "" ) . this is a film about characters not story line . bridget fonda plays the part of the sex-pot , druggie girlfriend of jackson , who possesses a twisted sense of humor that doesn't sit too well with robert de niro . this is a very quiet role for an actor of his stature , but he performs it as he should , on a low level , not upstaging the loquacious jackson . the scene is brilliantly funny , as tucker tells jackson why he doesn't want to get in the trunk . it is funny even after we see and realize the violence that follows because we don't care what happens to most of the characters in this film , not even to the rather sweet pam , though we are somewhat affected by her desperate situation for a moment or two . he steals the picture in a low-key , enigmatic performance . he might be the only one in the film we could care about , and the only one we wonder about , but , even for him , we do not feel deeply emotional . after a while the jackson character becomes too much for us to handle and actually starts wearing on our nerves . the film pulls off its goal to be entertaining , but falls way short of being as entertaining a film as pulp fiction . what is noteworthy about the film is how crisp the acting was . i , especially , liked the way pam played her part . it was very believable and without believing her the picture would have fallen apart . but , overall , the story lacked the kind of depth needed for it to be anything but a rather well-made and entertaining film . "
662,"this is an updated fable of the teutonic lovers , tristan and isolde . it is now considered to be a film classic , outliving the initial rejection of it . i did not feel that there was real passion on screen between the lovers , though i could accept their love intellectually and could understand that their fate was to die next to each other . . . the film satisfied my aesthetic senses . i thought it had magical qualities and enough of a brooding atmosphere to make up for my inability to be won over by sologne's performance . she was the weak link in this otherwise forceful film . "
663,"of all things made into a film , calligraphy is one subject that few movies have used as their subject , but greenaway , true to his reputation as a filmmaker with an outrageous streak in him to live up to , continues to make outlandish films that have a certain perversity to them , as well as show an elegance in clever filmmaking . pillow book is an individual's diary of observations and a presentment of an interesting list of things the diarist has jotted down , such as duck eggs and a silver bowl filled with shaved ice . the plot turns surprising simple , as revenge becomes the motive for nagiko , and this offbeat film will remain interesting mostly through its striking visualizations . the stunning visualizations range from ones of comedy to ones of sensuality to ones of gross cruely . her sensuality is seen in most of the books she writes , but seems special when she is with jerome , as frontal nudity is there , to be examined from all different angles by a technically efficient camera , that handles these nude scenes as casually as if the actors were fully dressed . the fun in the film is in the silliness of the story's subject matter as juxtaposed against the solemnity of the books being written on skin , with either somber religious chants or the same pop tune being played over and over in the background . she is really the only one in the film that we see developing and the only one whom we come to understand what she is trying to do . there seems to be a determined effort to be witty , even if the humor is not scaled to what the story is saying . the result of this work is a film that is startling to behold , with gorgeous photogenic shots , superimpositions , amazing computer graphics , a splash of intriguing gold and red color patterns , with everything ending up so perverse and lost in an intimacy that seems so melodramatic that even the scenes that do mean something to the characters still seem to be too absurd to really mean much . but the film did have plenty of fire to it , hatred , passion , jealousy , and mystery . i just didn't find that the story was that emotionally engaging to win me over completely to what i was seeing , even if i found the film had much to show for its effort . but for those who like to see the unusual and something that is artistic , this film is both unique and unforgettable : it's pure greenaway .

664,"harry cohn , head of columbia pictures , gave joseph h . lewis his first break to make a classier picture than his previous low-budget ones , and when he saw the early rushes of the film , he elevated "" my name is julia ross , "" from a 10-day "" b "" to an 18-day "" a "" picture . though not original in motif , nevertheless this film is a beauty , one that is able through its visualizations to strike a fresh looking chord . it is noted for its brooding atmosphere , its classical noir camera work , as the heroine is seen forlornly looking out of windows with bars on them , and the film is particularly noteworthy for the fine performances of its stars , nina foch as julia ross , dame may whitty as mrs . hughes , and george macready as ralph hughes . ralph is a rather frightening character , often seen whittling intensely away with his knife . lewis comes up with a few interesting plot twists to make the story even more scary , as the trapped julia fights desperately to save her life , figuring her best chance , is to get word to dennis . the result is a pretty good suspense story and the beginning of lewis's illustrious career in directing a better type of a film .

665,"a very pleasing rendition of a woody allen film , directed and written by woody . it is a fictional docudrama that smacks of woody's playfulness and love for jazz , and his inability to tell a straight story , but his great ability to tell a very personal one , which in this case is a very suitable way of telling it . the film also has the good sense to reach for woody's unique wit to get it through a few dry spells in the story . the joke that made me laugh the loudest , was when sean was bawling the girls out whom he pimped for about not bringing back enough money for him that night and they tell him , what do you expect , it's a jewish holiday ! it was the timing and the facial expressions seen on sean penn that made those kind of jokes work . the music was just beautiful to listen to and was played often enough during the course of the film , which should be pleasing to the aficionados of jazz . the film relies on the quirkiness of penn's performance to tell its lighthearted tale in a mock tone of seriousness , which captures the flavor of that period . her pantomine acting was in the best tradition of silent movies , as through her expressive facial gestures all the emotions she was feeling at the time were clearly seen ; all the long- sufferings that she has gone through . she also has a most pleasing smile , that anyone could understand . all the stories are so far apart , that none of the ridiculous versions could be verified by any of the experts , but what all the stories have in common , is that he hid in the backseat of the gangster's car and heard for sure that they were having an affair . woody's film is an appealing look back at that age of swing music and maybe a composite glimpse of how some jazzmen lived their lives . the great music played incudes the following renditions : "" sweet sue , "" "" all of me , "" "" i'm forever blowing bubbles "" and "" i'll see you in my dreams .

666,"written and directed by peter wellington , "" joe's so mean to josephine "" comes armed with a sharp-edged script and two bravo performances . this indie film , by the first-time director , takes place in toronto . it is not an easy movie to like because the relationship between the two opposites is painstakingly brutal and progresses at a very slow speed , building to both their metamorphoses and an inevitable but not fulfilling conclusion . but there is a power in the raw dramatics unearthed due to the edgy performances , at first told from the woman's point but later shifting to the man's view , that makes this one worth sticking with . there's something to this character study that breaks through what seem like an ordinary story and gives this film a puzzling breath of fresh air . it has something to say about relationships , and it says it in a way contemporaries can relate to . the director won canada's claude jutra award . he also is emotionally unstable , exhibiting fits of violence . she thinks it would be a good idea for him to try reading some of those books . but by this time something is also happening to joe . his usual reaction of violence to such situations won't work here . he pathetically tells her , in-between fits of throwing objects around the house , "" that i was wishing it was like it was before-- when you wanted to be with me . "" he is almost begging her , while sitting like a baby on the floor , "" why can't i be your boyfriend ? "" there's a lot this movie has to say about meeting the wrong person , and this character-driven work makes the most of it , in this very engrossing , humorous , incisive , but , at times , very upsetting film to watch .

667,"wallace shawn and andre gregory play themselves , in louis malle's two-character drama , displaying wit , humor and charm . what is real is their personalities that shine through , as for the opinions stated by each , that is scripted but is probably not that far from their actual personalities . what results is a dinner conversation that at times seems bewitching and at other times seems to be egotistical twaddle . the overall effect is that the film seemed different , and therefore one had the odd quality of watching these two eat roast quail in a top-scale restaurant and psychoanalyze each other between munching on their potato soup . it proved to be a compelling venture in storytelling , if nothing else . some people in the theater thought he cracked-up and some have even seen him talking to trees . andre had just come from ingmar bergman's "" autumn sonata , "" and was moved by ingrid bergman saying : "" i could always live in my art , but not in my life . '' as the two engage in a genial disagreement about what life means , but showing most of all , that they are both good listeners , challenging the audience to carefully listen to a movie more than to watch it . wally tells of playing a cat on stage and how some of the other actors who actually liked him , made negative remarks of how he won't be able to perform properly in that costume . wally believes they said this because it is difficult to express feelings directly to people . andre counters , that we can't be direct so we end up saying the weirdest things . in tibet , he watched as tibetans would have tea in silence , sitting for hours and finding no need to talk if they had nothing to say . we don't have to travel to some exotic place to find reality , it is right here . he also goes on to say , that if you can't react honestly to people-there is a deadness . the dinner seemed to end on an apology for both to go back to their comfortable lifestyles , momentarily exhilarated by the richness of the meal , the cheer of communicating their thoughts , and by the many provoking subjects broached . these two seemed like two smug but likable new york intellectuals , who have a good rap going for them . i thought how riveting the conversation was and how it all ended up being so mundane , titillating but irrelevant . the only thing left savoring was the delicious mood they set . but for the viewer , any one of the numerous topics brought into the conversation , could be a stimulant for further contemplation . i thought the energy and the absurdity of the film , was the intangible grandeur , the something that made this film a special treat , no matter its seemingly bourgeois idealism . "
668,"the film highlights the interactions of the likable but weakminded lukas and the vibrant emmy ( sophie rois ) to tell its sad tale . it is a dark morality tale , excitingly shot , about the powerful ones acting petty and cruel , while the peasants act with dignity and courage . ruzowitzky's film throws out many political ideas , gives one a true sense of what collective hatred and what class warfare are like . the film has many different moods to it : ranging from dark comedy to free-spirited romance to bitter violence . it is a well-made film ; it clearly shows how injustice is part of a system that enslaves people . "
669,"this , his first film since his 1994's death and the maiden , is a visually stunning mystery chiller about the supernatural that is a good example of old-fashioned storytelling . a lengthy film ( 132 minutes ) that doesn't overstay its welcome , as it keeps one guessing till the very end how it will be resolved and even then , there is puzzlement . but the film is not without some flaws in its storytelling as attested by the last scenes , which are resolved in pyrotechnics and do leave a lot to be desired . many critics will justifiably argue that there is no proper payoff in the director's payoff . but i'll take this polanski version of a horror story over so many others that i have seen recently , there is an elegant craftsmanship and an ability shown by him , to keep one in suspense for most of the film without resorting to hollywood's special effect grab bag of tricks typically used for this genre . polansky also captured the feel of what it is like to be a rare-book collector . it is a film that , if it does nothing else , it depicts the lives of those who are searching for dramatic meaning in their life through books of the occult . that polanski is a skeptic , only adds resonance to the telling of the story . he does not make a copy of the book and therefore places himself in an awkward spot if the book should be stolen . his unique lifestyle is one that is rarely depicted in movies as well as it is here . she is the most enigmatic character in the story , whose real identity will be revealed by the end of the film . she did have one nude scene in the movie , which she passed with flying colors . there are more things to like about this film than dislike . for starters , i was impressed by depp's subdued performance , it gave his character credibility and even though he wasn't an ethical character , he made himself more palatable as the film progressed and he seemed to become more of a victim than someone who is uncaringly in this deal for just a windfall profit . he had a healthy detachment from the subject matter of the book ( just like the director was detached from the storyline ) , as he unwittingly uncovers various reasons people like to collect occult books . i was also impressed by the way darius khondji's cinematography took me around europe , into castles , private library collections , voyeuristically looking into dark corners , and into a devil worship ceremony . it was shot largely by using a wide-angled lens , always pointing to interesting shots of dark corridors , or of villages that had a strangely beautiful feel toward them . i felt i was transported into the world of book collectors , hearing them converse and seeing what makes them want to be collectors , and how some are merely pretenders and some real lovers of books . the film , unfortunately , ultimately suffered from an undue silliness and how it ended by fading out to a glowing white screen , as if that is supposed to mean something special , did not work for me . unless , it is meant solely as polansky's private joke that all this devil worship is nonsense in the first place , and by ending on a blank note , all he is doing is telling the audience that there is nothing to see . if there's a more metaphysical message , it wasn't conveyed to me by the film . but , that aside , i still maintain that this picaresque film adapted from arturo perez-reverte's popular spanish novel el club dumas is better than most satanic thrillers , especially those recent ones relying on blood and gore to shock the viewer . here , the director is mostly spoofing the conventions of horror movies and it is his very personal humor that should be appreciated , along with the brilliance he brings to the screen with his filmmaking ability . the satan worshippers' annual meeting on torchia's birthday is a good example of what i mean by the director's brand of malevolent humor being on display , seeing how the wannabes in satanism are cloaked in black and using mumbo jumbo to summon up satan , as langella boldly enters their ceremony and calls them all fools and shouts , "" boo ! "" that is the joke polansky is having with the audience . both these ritualized ceremonies should not be looked at without seeing them for the farces they are in the eyes of each filmmaker . polansky has crafted a metaphysical suspense film that is more lightheaded than scary , which might disappoint some but should not take away from the many pleasures derived from this engrossing thriller . "
670,"a more-than-acceptable variation of jacques tourneur's cat people ( 42 ) , that is excellent in spots , but lags in its overall pacing . the scene is marvelously done , as it cuts away from the leopard's attack to picture leonora enjoying this revenge . though very imitative of the tourneur film and not quite as masterfully done , this rarely shown horror film is worth catching for its dark intensity and the eerie mood it sets . "
671,"refn moves the pusher along with an inward existential beat to it and outwardly we hear the loud pulsating electric music of heavy-metal . the film has a sharp-edged look by using available light- shot so that the handheld camera jitters- just like the unflappable antihero does in his guts . there are some chilling scenes thrown in , that are not shocking , but represent the matter-of-fact violence that is taking place . whether frank lives or not , becomes less important than in seeing what a hell he has made for himself , desperately trying anything he can , to outhustle his way out of this mess he is in . the only thing that stops this film from being better than it is , is that frank has proven himself to be a worthless human being , and the film doesn't take us into his inner being , giving him any hope if he should somehow survive the mess he's in , he would be a better person for it . so , ultimately , it is difficult to care that much about what happens to frank . the director has cooked up a very disturbing film , that is derivative of pulp fiction ( the conversation frank and tonny have over the difference between renting a video and going out to a movie could be right out of pulp ) . but , this is not a bad effort for someone who never went to film school .

672,"the wilderness and the snowbound land are visually appealing , while the eskimos come across as a friendly people , easily given to smiling , even if some are suspicious of the white men , thinking of them to be useless as hunters . the filmmaker massot shows the filmmaker flaherty staging shots of eskimos building igloos , sleeping together , and lots of faked shots of eskimos doing things solely for the camera . but somehow the film works in a very human way and the thrill of seeing the eskimos live in such harsh conditions is something few westerners can readily comprehend or for that matter , have ever seen before . both films are distinguished for using the real intuits to play themselves . so much for hollywood and what it considers important . "
673,"this way no one talks if captured . one of the most absurd scenes , even for fuller , who lives to film whacky scenes like this one , is in the teahouse , where the american gangsters are partaking of the traditional japanese tea ceremony and griff is carrying on to the ice-cold sandy about not being close to him anymore , ranting at him , i'm your ichi-ban , not that newcomer . why can't i go with you on the next job ? this is a particularly violent and crude noir work , whose subject matter offers a penetrating look at the american occupation of japan , basically saying that what the u . s . is doing there is criminal . it also magnifies the huge cultural bridges the two countries have and why it is so difficult for the two countrys to get to know and trust one another . this is highlighted by the very formal structure of the love relationship between mariko and eddie , where eddie is always viewed as a foreigner and can't be fully accepted , no matter what he does . their love story left an empty feeling in the pit of my stomach , as there seemed to be a psychological separation between the two that couldn't be reconciled . even though the story had a lot of loose ends to it and didn't make sense most of the time , the strangeness of the characters and the oddness of the location made for a telling tale , a sure-fire iconoclastic fuller experience , for a director who just goes into a film and grabs what he wants out of it , not caring a darn about how silly it all looks . fuller , as always , is resourceful and fresh . his films guarantee the viewer a jolt or two of electricty into their nonplused movie faces . here , the number of jolts is much higher , thereby making this an even juicier fuller spectacle . "
674,"holy smoke is a beautiful film to watch -- from the feverish credit sequence -- of the film's title written in smoky letters , to kate winslet's psychodelic-like india sojourn , and then onto her trying experiences in the naturally scenic australian outback . the film has perfectly framed scenes and magnificent visuals , and a divertingly amusing storyline to tune into , even if it gives into its own silly side and becomes after a fast start mostly a wonderfully entertaining film touching on many societal nerve points but going nowhere but back into its own cynical view of life , resorting to a politically safe response to all its pin pricks about mind control . though , in all honesty , it should be commended for taking chances and telling its guru story in this refreshingly different style . how perceptive of a film it is , is questionable , as it is provocatively stimulated by overwrought acting and filled with the aussie taste for slapdash comedy and vulgar dialogue . there is too much of a loss of subject context to do any serious intellectual damage about any of the themes it broaches . but it does , on the serious side of its agenda , at least , raise some valid points about mind control and how men treat women . it is scripted by the campion sisters ( jane & anna ) and directed by jane , with a very noticeable woman's touch and a ribald sense of lustiness . at the gathering , there is a gaudily resplendent array of yellow and pink colors to dazzle the senses , seeming more like a light show for a jefferson airplane concert at the fillmore west than a religious ceremony . but mom has trouble adjusting to india : its crowds , lack of modern toilets , and its strange culture . all of their warmth and smiles for her seem disingenuous , especially when compared to the guru's . he also goes heavy on the mouth spray , making sure he is sweet-smelling at all times . the two go off to the outback as p . j . puts into motion his 3-day step program , and the breakdown in the film's sensibility becomes astronomical at this point , making me wonder what the campion sisters were thinking . the film loses its sense of credibility and becomes a battle of the sexes , with the inevitable male-female struggle taking precedence over the heavy-handed religious aspects first introduced into the story . in reality , praying does not guarantee that one's prays will be answered . so , in short , he's not for her , and no matter what he does won't work , which kills the romance part to this screwball comedy . what does this all mean , not too much , except its fun to see keitel get his stereotypical male psyche bruised and ham it up as kate turns the tables on him . but , ah ! those breasts of kate are really something to behold . . . but it is her personality that is the star of the film . she was the only one in the film who wasn't a shallow caricature , and her performance was daring , even smashing , taking this zany script and making the most of it , getting out of it certainly more than it deserved . which means the film actually worked in some skewed sense , as it dove into the question of mind control and the human condition and gave no answers , except the strong suggestion that having compassion for another person is what has to emerge from a person's heart before they can be expected to be free from their karma . and , in a muddled way , this film lets the audience be the observer and lets it come to its own conclusions , which is why i imagine this film will get a mixed-bag of reviews-- ranging from those who can't stand it , to those who rave about it . there were so many wasted moments that blunted this beautifully shot film , that shot itself unecessarily in the foot , even though it did manage to escape from being a dud by its freaky humor and its nonstop assault on the senses of propriety , making this a madcap comedy instead of anything else . it also badly underutilized the talented pam grier , giving her such a miniscule and predictable part , that she had no chance to do her thing . but what it had going for it , is a sense of freedom , an eye for beauty , and kate's undaunting performance , which makes it something to put in your pipe and smoke . if only it wasn't so ridiculous , it could have been a much more salient film , even if it were to lose a few laughs along the way .

675,"for ms . deepa mehta -- fire is the first film of her trilogy on the elements , this her second , and water , to be filmed later , will be her third . they believe they can be invisible , spreading sweetness to the land like sugar placed in the middle of a glass of milk . the problem with the film is twofold ; one , is that all these tragic events are translated through the childish eyes of lenny , who cannot grasp everything that is happening , she just doesn't have the maturity to do that . because of that , the story has too much of a childish flavor to it and is simplified to a point that touches on being too fine . it was an unneeded artifice , that tended to spoil the flow of the film's dramatics . the other problem , with this otherwise splendid history lesson and tragic love story , is that all the movie's metaphors are used as if they were merely to amplify the historical tale . the character's lives were reduced in scope and they seemed to be milked for the benefit of making the story fit into the historical text . it is stunningly photographed , using reds and purples to express the blood-curdling scenes of lahore under siege and a glowing yellow for the warm household scenes and a brownish amber to catch the vast beauty of the countryside . it is noteworthy for exploring in detail the destruction of innocence and the arbitrary splitting up of the earth , and how everyone gets caught up in the emotional frenzy of hatred and how difficult it is to just do what is right . there was a certain power the film had , that could not be denied . nandita das as shanta , is the heart of the picture . her performance was very moving and gave life to this epic film . his masterful performance , changing from an endearing and helpful figure , to one who embraces violence , was what put a human face of evil on this melodrama and saved the film from being thought of as mostly a metaphorical historical exercise . "
676,"a powerfully haunting film , that should leave one with some deep emotional pains over its human drama or turn one completely off by its obvious political intentions . this is a banned film in china and one that they will be unlikely to be showing there for quite awhile , as its negative reactions to mao's cultural revolution from 1967-1976 , is a blanket indictment against china's attempt at mass indoctrination . for him , one place is like another , so it makes no difference that he is in so barren a region . it is sheer madness the way this program is administered and carried out , whereas no one comes for her when her time is up and there is no one there to tell her anything . that she panics , thinking she will be left here for good , is understandable . the film shows by comparing her mood swings to the natural surroundings , the vast and changing sky , how small she feels , how it has sunk into her how far apart she is from the things she loves to do and how much she misses her warm family . by contrast , it is shown how comfortable lao jin is here . it is a most interesting performance by this 16-year-old actress , lu lu , which gets the audience feeling sorry for her , but at the same time , feeling annoyed that she acts so badly against the saintly herder . it is a uniquely masterful performance , that seldom gets translated on the screen in such a true way as it does here . the flaw in the film , comes with its bleak ending , that seemed to be contrived and used as a means of getting more sympathy out of the audience than it needed to . it took away from the impact of this strange relationship , that had been mesmerizing and touching in a very real way . it returned the film to the heavy-handed symbolic message it had succeeded in avoiding through the telling of its energetic human drama . the beautiful camera shots of the landscape and the poetry of the girl's loss of innocence , were undermined to a certain degree by how this allegory unfolded . xiu xiu's story is sad one , but one wonders if it was really so overwhelming as it is portrayed here . nevertheless , this was a substantial film , that had its heart in the right place and offers a story that is of a superior quality . overall , a splendid effort is achieved . "
677,"the heroine in this wacky autobiography learns the hard way that it pays to be unique , even if that might require an acceptance of her being unhappy , if the alternative is , that happiness means that you have to be like everyone else . "" slums "" is a sharp-witted , biting screwball comedy about a semi-dysfunctional family who have some problems that prevents them from being a happy family but not the kind of problems that can't be overcome . her wide-eyed and aghast looks at what she sees happening to her are what give this film its particular flavor and her comical and sad observations are right-on-target . murray is a brash , intrusive , and insensitive single-parent , who means well but overextends his good intentions and fails to see his mistakes in time . tomei gives a wonderfully over-the-top performance as a lost soul , who brings her quirky antics into a household that is trying to act like "" people "" but can't seem to make it . this scene was funny but it was also very hurtful to watch . it touched on all the nerves that made this into an intense dramatic scene , that worked so well because the script was tight and the actors were well-cast , with especially natasha lyonne , as the girl who was always being surprised as she tries to find out who she is . a small gem of a film , much better than the sitcom material it portends to be . "
678,"this film was adapted from a lucille fletcher 22-minute radio drama , where agnes moorehead played the invalid heiress leona stevenson . the film plays on one's fears of being alone and of being physically handicapped . the film uses the method of flashback to enlarge the story . the film is well executed , mainly through the efforts of the director and the star of the film . even as an intolerable woman , casting herself in self-imprisonment , she engineers our sympathy for her current plight , as we see that she desperately needs psychological treatment more than anything else . "
679,"here , the director , himself a rom member , is in love with the gypsies -- their foibles and all -- and plays a joke with their worldwide pejorative image by reversing the things usually said about gypsies , and having the gypsies say them about the foreigners . the film has caught the gypsy mood and their persona : the gypsies here have gold teeth , the women bathe together in the nude and talk about the men in a frank sexual manner , the men drink a lot , play music with deep feelings , curse on a regular basis , and are quick to smile and see the humor in almost everything they do . may i rot ! "" they shout in excitement , "" there's a great big gadjo sleeping at our place ! "" "" gadjo dilo , "" in the gypsies' romany language , means "" crazy stranger , "" which becomes a reference to the french youth and the film's title . for the director , the question becomes , how is it , whenever events turn bad , the gypsy community is almost always made the scapegoat . gatlif succeeded in setting an evocative gypsy mood , touching on their charms , highlighting their moving music , demonstrating the sheer joy in their wedding ceremonies , and leaving a good taste in one's mouth about the gypsy spirit to survive . though the film doesn't tell a great story but a conventional one , even with all the exotic atmosphere the film exudes in , but it still holds one's interest throughout , as the moods change and gypsy life takes a more dramatic turn .

680,"this creepy serial killer tale had all the more fright in it than the more highly touted "" felicia's journey , "" and was a superior telling of a homicidal maniac on the prowl story than the more flamboyant venture "" american psycho "" was . i take the natural momentum of a person and draw it towards me . you don't always choose what you do , sometimes what you do chooses you . "" hampton fancher , the blade runner screenwriter and the first-time director of "" the minus man , "" creates a film that sets a dark mood of everyday normal life contrasted by the cheery personality of vann , who looks like the average "" joe , "" easily fitting into his surroundings . he is such a well-mannered and congenial young man , whose appeal is supposed to make us irritated that we can like someone like him . the emptiness of his action , and the film's emphasis on his charms , while keeping his past mysterious , adds chills to his moody persona . but , because he is so polite , he does not arouse the trooper's suspicions and therefore no search of the vehicle takes place . this is a different kind of part for the usually gruff garofalo . what carries the day for this film about the banality of evil , which presents its story as a mind game owen wilson is playing , is the strong performances by him and brian cox , as they both are good at conveying men who are psychologically damaged goods . the film gets over , despite its weakness of allowing the serial killer to be someone whom we can never understand or come to terms with . these weird killings do happen in present society , and when we read about them in the newspapers , we even know less about 'why' than we do here . in the characterization wilson gave to this psychopath , you could see how his normalcy wasn't normal , and maybe that's about all we know about most serial killers . but , we can't let society off the hook as generously as we do in the newspapers , and what makes this film particularly engaging , at least more engaging than most of the serial killer films i have seen recently , is that in this film the sickness in society also becomes part of understanding why these weird things happen . what is unsaid becomes , at least , pointed out as to where we should start looking for answers , if we can only stop looking at the conventional places where we usually look and start looking at ourselves as a society and what we have created . i just wish this film had more body in it , more of a feeling for what it was up to , something more revealing . "
681,"sacha vierny , as cinematographer , supplies the film with striking visuals , every scene is beautiful to behold . the technicolors of favor for the film are the different shades of brown resembling the marvelous architecture in rome and the pure shades of white , which tend to introduce the characters in their best light , before it becomes apparent that they are all obnoxious to a certain degree and not as pure as they first might have seemed . this film like all greenaway productions , is a splendid visual film to behold . the film might not add up to much in weight , but the sum of its parts were like an apple hitting newton on his noggin . it had one mesmorizing visual scene after another , and gave one enough fodder to think about all the spiritual and corporeal themes it just spread before your eyes without going further into them . greenaway , as always , is an acquired taste . "
682,"the film makes it a point to show that the fictional region has its quota of local eccentrics , many of whom are related to one another . for the most part , the film is done in a campy way , balanced by veteran character actor ernie hudson playing his role seriously , taking offense at the racial slurs and showing that he's a powerful man , willing to take a strong stand for what he believes in . this is a very compelling story , aside from the weakness of claire's role , where she acts more campy than real . the film is most similar in racial tone to "" to kill a mockingbird , "" but is played more humorously and with less drive for its interracial sexual motives being the source for the crime . "
683,"her mind has already been f * cked with . their conversations and snide remarks while carrying on the investigation brings on an element of comedy , which seems absurd in the face of how horrid the murder is , but it is diverting . this explanation of what she did , seems far-fetched and takes away a lot of credibility from the story , which had been thus far , a very ably put together murder mystery . the feminist role in the military and the male attitude toward women in the military is sharply touched upon . the film throws itself into the dark water and everyone gets splashed by its jump into water that is too deep for travolta . it works as an entertaining and well-acted thriller that could have used more imagination and less gruesome sexual details in telling its story , as the military cover-up might have been a more interesting direction to go than in dwelling on the sordid crime .

685,"inspired by the maverick finnish director aki kaurismaki's 1987 "" hamlet goes business , "" michael almereyda ( another girl , another planet/nadja ) directs this updated mainstream , mock serious version of hamlet with great wit , style , and immediacy . he effortlessly transfers locations from denmark to the new york city of 2000 , which shows how malleable hamlet is and how right it seems to take it away from its staginess and sole reliance on dialogue instead of making it a more cinematic experience . but what almereyda fails to do in this slenderized ( no gravediggers here ) version of hamlet , is make his modern visuals jive with the staginess of the bard's words , therefore the film always felt jarring . even in some very beautifully mannered scenes , there was a note of clumsiness , indicating something was missing or didn't match about this far-reaching production that bordered on mawkish giddiness , though not quite falling down that hole . the old style english dialogue and the new visuals did not make for a coherent film , with the visuals being spectacular and relevant , while the dialogue seemed to be from another planet , or from another venue . i thought i would never say that shakespeare's hamlet is better visually than its dialogue , but in this film version , that is clearly the case . by not changing the tone of the shakespearian dialogue to the neurotically nasal everyday speech of the modern new yorker , while radically altering the visual effects to fit in with the current times , the film developed a split-personality , which it was never able to recover from . if you are going to change things , why make half the film conform to traditional shakespeare , when you could have taken a further risk and made the entire film a glittering display of inventiveness , and perhaps achieve a major breakthrough in how to present hamlet to a modern audience ! hamlet is a troubled soul who is a struggling digital videomaker , with fits of self-importance and bouts of illusionary grandeur . hamlet has such a grungy attitude . the video is a comically haphazard avant-garde work by the animator lewis klahr , showing a variety of historical film footage . hamlet and ophelia are a perfectly beautiful looking but obnoxious couple , who are plagued by the modern problem of lack of communication . it is difficult to take this hamlet in quite the same serious way it is usually presented onstage , and that's just fine . refreshingly , this film does not have one ounce of pretention to high culture . the cast all come with their own individual ideas about the characters they are playing and offer their odd renditions for the traditional roles . hawke delivers his "" to be or not to be "" soliloquy in the action video section of a blockbuster store . the story , though almost cut in half , still is basically the same . but the dramatic effect is different . you have to lose something when you throw away all that shakespeare dialogue . in some scenes we look through all the egotism of the characters through glass that is crystal clear and easy to shatter , and the effect is a sharpened sense of what we are seeing . but when the final tragedy unfolds , there is no real emotion in it , the film failed to pull us into that scene . it seemed as if the soul had been taken out of it . and that is the major fault of the film . what lingers , is a strong sense that we are steeped in a hamlet who must be viewed with urgency , a sense of foreboding gloom , and with a sense of ticklish glibness . the picture was shot in super 16 millimeter . its nyc face is given a glossy , bluish and grayish tint , catching all the limos , glass closets , and glass high-rise structures john de borman could film with his superlative camerawork . nyc never looked more like a glistening denmark or a glass house , while "" hamlet "" looks more like a work of visual poetry instead of sounding like great literature . an interesting concept , too bad almereyda couldn't completely pull it off . yet i applaud the chances he took and all the misses never completely deterred me from enjoying the film . it came awfully close to being camp , but the oddness of this unlikely cast playing shakespeare , somehow , held the film together and made it accessible to an audience that shakespeare might not have reached before . even though hawke's hamlet had the edge of a young man's immaturity and impetuousness , what would have really given this film a sense of manic self-consciousness , would have been to cast sean penn as hamlet , though james dean in that part would have been the ultimate coup de grace .

687,"the epsteins are wonderful musicians and storytellers , openly explaining their music and talking about themselves with no pretensions or false modesty . they have no inhibitions about talking , in fact , it is hard to get them to keep quiet . but the richness of the lively music and the very natural and easy way the brothers play and communicate , makes this a heartfelt film , just like the music being played . you don't have to be jewish to like the music , as they proved to be popular in front of a mainly non-jewish audience in berlin , who couldn't get enough of that music . but when they played in their florida neighborhood to an elderly jewish audience , you couldn't help but notice how much more lively and even more appreciative their audience was . it also goes on a dull side trip to pinsk , a place that borders russia-poland , where their parents are from , but someplace they are unfamiliar with and because of that there was nothing worthwhile to see there . but , in all fairness to the director , aside from a few lapses in the film , he did capture the essence of the kletzmer music and what makes the epsteins so special . the brothers take pride in their craft and it shows in their musical pieces presented , as they bring out a heartfelt joy in their music . it was a fun film to watch , and it was informative to watch them practice and discuss the music , never taking themselves too seriously , but always serious about doing a good job . this film should be seen for the remakable music , the film itself is not that remarkable .

688,"written and directed with style by richard shepard ( the linguini incident ) , "" oxygen "" is a compelling psychodrama , whose story is sickening but is superbly played by an excellent cast . adrien brody got the most he could get out of the character and gives a riveting performance of someone who has gone over the edge . maura tierney also turns in a spectacular performance , portraying a very troubled but courageous woman . it was clearer to find out what was troubling harry than it was to get to the bottom of her problem , but her characterization of a pained woman was almost as interesting as his . the victim's impatient husband pulls strings and gets thev f . b . i . no police procedure would ever take that chance , and the film hinges all its marbles on that being accepted for its tricky ending to work . but for sheer excitement , the fast-paced film moves rapidly along to see if the police can get to the buried frances in time , and in the meantime , brody gives the performance of his career so far . "" oxygen "" had some fresh air in its tank which it leaked out at times to refreshen some of its derivative scenes , especially the opening subway scene , where the lead police couple come across a wanted felon and give chase , in a scene that looked like it came right out of "" the french connection .

689,"a visually stunning serial killer film , with mind-bending special effects , computer imaging , special f/x , and gorgeous costumes , as directed by commercial and music-video director tarsem singh , in his debut feature film . the cinematic beauty and originality of this pioneering visual film hides the banality of the story and the weak storytelling , as the director doesn't know quite what to do with the film after setting it up with set designs that are simply breathtaking . he doesn't know how to close the story or how to keep it suspenseful . this is an arty serial killer film that is not necessarily an art nor is it a mainstream film , it's an in-betweener , where what is seen is more than what there is , which leaves a terrible void when trying to get past the colorful , disturbing , and enjoyable display of images , and then deciphering the content . but the visuals are so stimulating , that they almost cover up all the film's loose ends . the visuals inside the mind are spectacular images of lunacy and are laced with compelling and original art designs , all of the images are beautifully colored . in the child's head , she is dressed as a princess in a white feathered gown , standing on glistening island sand with a crystal clear sky invading the senses with an array of brightness , that could be as inviting as a tourist commercial for travellers , except there is a bizarre quality about these images that is more than an eyeful for an ad . most of the film , is spent taking a mind trip with catherine as she explores the subconscious of both this child and of a serial killer , while the chase of the killer is not particularly interesting , playing a secondary role to the cinematography of the mind . the main focus of the film is the visual journey itself , therefore the actors are mostly asked to blend in and not steal the scenery from the visuals . it is something they successfully do . jennifer lopez is surprisingly credible as a therapist and the one the film hinges on to take us on this mind trip , vince vaughn plays his low-key role in an expressively adequate manner , and vincent d'onofrio elicits some sympathy for being a victim of child abuse while also seen as an over-the-top psycho , someone who is capable of torturing women for no logical reasons . but one is always reminded that the actors are not as important as the cinematography is , as the film always returns to the visualizations of the mind to keep the intensity going . the film had enough visual material to keep you looking at it and wondering what does it all mean since it wasn't a very frightening serial killer picture , and its mind explorations did not take us down some unmarked jungian trail . it ends up by having the hero rescue the heroine in the nick of time , allowing the film to wend its way back into the conventional way serial killer films usually conclude . perhaps , with a more razor-sharp story and requiring more from the capable cast , the film could have lived up to its visualizations and have been a masterpiece , instead of settling for being an engrossing film that is very entertaining , a film that certainly sets a new high standard for photography .

690,"it could be almost like a documentary that someone like espn would do , such as there 'when baseball was a game , ' but in this depression-era nostalgia piece about a genuine jewish baseball superstar -- supposedly , the first one who openly said he was jewish and wouldn't change his name -- the game becomes much more than what it is . it becomes a look at the social and political climate of america just as much as a baseball biography . it would drive in . it was as if hank was passing the baton to jackie . there is no doubt about it , hank was an inspiration to many people who needed such a heroic figure . this film had a very skillful way of telling its story about a bygone era , doing it in an effortlessly grand style , with a tongue-in-cheek humor . besides , any film that has a clip of the marx brothers breaking up a symphony orchestra to make it seem like a baseball game , has a good idea of when to be humorous and when to point out the seriousness of the slurs hank had to go through . hank was a class act , never openly complaining about what he went through , just talking about it because that was the real way it was . the only fault of the film , was that the director became too close to his subject , and perhaps , overdramatized the effects of greenberg . the conclusion of ww11 also had a lot to do with the change of america's attitude , though it is doubtful if anti-semitism is through for good , as there are still other barriers in america that have to be broken down , such as having a jewish president . "
691,"all the country's money was needed to rebuilt , as movies seemed a frivolous activity at the time . rossellini used poor film stock leftover from the fascists and filmed despite all the technical deficiencies he ran into , and came up with a gritty , authentic looking film for his grim story of survival and fight for freedom . this was a breakthrough film for the director , whose neorealism style , using a hollywood type of narrative and a documentary style approach to filming , caught the dire mood of the resistance movement and the ordinary people who fought the fascists . awards such as the new york film critics circle and best film in cannes in 1946 , came to this film . it awakened an international audience to the knowledge that italian cinema was well and roberto rossellini was a director to be reckoned with , along with de sica , who just filmed "" shoe shine "" in the neorealism style , also , to international acclaim . the film has an immediacy about it , but it also seemed overly melodramatic at times , relying so much on the premise , that by being as good as the germans , the italians , the slave-race , can prove that there was no need for the war since there is no such thing as a master race . that manfredi dies without talking after being tortured , makes his heroics larger than anyone else's , and proves that the italians are every bit as good as the germans . rossellini hoped to examine the italian soul and show that there were both good and bad people among them , while the german's have gone so far off the edge of sanity , that it is hard to find a good german because of their perverse beliefs . anna magnani gives the film credibility through her humanity , as her story is filled with her heartfelt yearnings . the other professional actor among all the nonprofessionals to standout , was the priest role as warmly played by aldo fabrizi , who elicited a call for sensibility and caring for people . though , the film does not seem as relevant as it was when first released and acclaimed as a masterpiece , having lost some of its purity , nevertheless , it still retains its moral high ground and its ability to show the collective will of the people , who resisted being oppressed . it is still a work of considerable merit .

692,"vincent gardenia and elliott gould who are in the film , were also in the original play . everything is played out in a revue format , as every sketch is done in the form of a scathing farce . the performers were outstanding , as i was especially pleased with marcia rodd's captivating portrayal of someone with spunk . the film was torridly on target and eerily funny , but only to a point , as it seemed to create such a far-out situation , that it was difficult to keep laughing when there was so much cynicism and so much that went beyond the pale of farce and became too arcane to decifer where it was leading to . when elizabeth wilson has the film's last word and says , "" you don't know how good it is to hear my family laughing again , "" this coming after they acted as snipers , which leaves the black humor with a very tainted message that bears watching . "
693,"an updated version from the '60s one , remade with a fresher theme that is fit for the '90s . the caper is also more fun to watch , has much more splash to its story line , and is better looking than the original . in many ways it's a better overall film than the steve mcqueen one , but retains the same trashy disposable entertainment value . no one will mistake this middle brow venture for an art film . the film looked so glossy and flew by at such an easygoing pace , that it was an enjoyable guilty pleasure , a delicious hollywood film for those looking for escapism and a romance that portends to be steamy and intimate , but is really glib and only superficially satisfying . it's more like a james bond film in its banal idea of what love and adventure is , as the film rolls out the big-ticket items to impress the viewer . there is no end to the bounty of materialism in this film . in the closing scene , he steals another valuable picture hanging near the monet for catherine's sake , but he also puts the monet back in its place in the museum . it was an ingenious scene , where many impersonators of a magritte painting , who are dressed in imitation of the picture , as inconspicuous businessmen in dark suits and bowler hats , carrying briefcases , make it difficult for the police to keep tabs on them all . it's a fantasy film fantasizing how good it would be to have so much money that you can do anything you wanted . the emptiness of those pleasures rival the film's empty look at romance and adventure , and should give one pause to think how disappointing it sometimes might be to get what one wishes for . this is an easy film to take it as it is ! it is a well-crafted star vehicle , whose stars have a good chemistry together , and there is a bonus--it comes with gorgeous location shots and lots of plot twists .

"
695,"this comedy/romance story is more about the sense of communication than it is about the mystery story or about the five senses the structure of its story is built around . it is done in a delicately stylized form , filmed mostly in dark , somber shades , as the story revolves around the characters in an office/residential building in toronto . the film moves along at a brisk pace , which kept me interested in their lives , but what the story failed to do was tell me all it can about the characters . nevertheless , i was satisfied with the film and the very sensitive nature it tapped into , as it touched a nerve in each one's character and left me caring about them , despite thinking that maybe the characters were a bit shallow . this engrossing film touches on the fears people have who are losing their senses and how they must rely on the sense that is their strongest to pull them through their difficulties . rona struggles to understand herself through the sense of taste that is both her strong and weak point . they are seen slyly talking to each other about what to avoid in a relationship , since they have both experienced many failed ones they have much in common . this sequence didn't have the flow to it the others did , and even though it was touching to see , it seemed too calculated to have much of an affect . jeremy podeswa ( eclipse ) , the writer-director , has come up with a captivating film despite the shallowness of the characters and the story being a landmine full of clich ? s . there are things shown in the relationships uncovered that bring out so many emotional qualities , as this independent film takes risks on a story line that borders on being perceived as too arty , but somehow it works because it has something to say about relationships that are so painful to bear . that i didn't get to know as much about the characters as i would have liked , gets overridden by how well the story was presented . i don't think the film would have worked if it weren't for the nuanced ways of the film and if it tried to tidy up everyone's life by the finale . the point being made , is that it is the small little things one does to stimulate one's senses that counts the most , whether it is when one reaches out for another , or when just trying to understand someone else and giving them succor , that it is by using one's senses to connect with someone else that makes life worth living . these revelations were too banal to make this more than an intriguing film . but , the story did catch and hold my interest . "
696,"this psychological thriller is based on john hopkin's play "" this story of yours . "" this is a brilliantly acted picture , especially the performances of both sean connery as the veteran policeman but the now emotionally tortured inquisitor , sgt . the film was in some ways spoiled but not ruined by the pretentiously arty way it was directed . it framed its shots in an exaggerated arty manner , which took away from the subtlety of the unfolding story . he identifies so much with what the perp is thinking , that he can just look at him and know if he did the crime or not . the story then goes into a flashback and we see sgt . the audience knows that he is guilty because we saw him at the scene of the crime . in this claustrophobic holding-room , johnson bullies baxter , while baxter sneers at him in a mocking tone . the film remains fascinating , aided by impeccable performances and a dialogue that has some bite in it . the film might appear too stagy for some , but i found it an absorbing experience . it held my interest throughout . "
697,"a bitter-sweet fantasy , in the form of a black comedy . this is the first film he's done that's not written by him , as it was scripted by john c . richards/james flamberg . it is another heartless stab by the director aimed at the heart of mankind , showing them at their stupidest and cruelest moments , one that tweaks the sensibilities about american pop culture and its whimsical effect on the population . it uses the ridiculous banal plot of a soap opera called 'a reason to love' and manages to get a story that runs parallel . this modern adult fairy tale , told in the style of the "" wizard of oz , "" is also set in kansas and has the heroine , ala dorothy , leaving that rational state for one of fantasy . the humor comes in how the characters actually fall for the fantasy they are spoon fed by tv . she never misses an episode and identifies solely with a nurse chloe , even knowing the nurse's lines by heart . it would take a suspension of disbelief to take in what ensued after the murder and not question it . the film has another gory murder scene , as it breaks the mood of fantasy and returns to a reality that is even more absurd than the fantasy world . a bloody shootout occurs and everything that can get straightened out does as a result of that . but it was not possible for me to believe anything about this tale , especially the purported sweet ending tried for . this tale was spiced with too much human depravity and insanity , making betty to be anything but another dorothy gale , but more like a crazy person or an idiot . i found this adult fairy tale to be one that was trapped in its own mixture of cynicism and delusions . the director could never quite decide on what he wanted betty to be like , so i was left with the impression that she was a cartoon-like character , not able to distinguish what was real or fantasy . i don't think the film has come up with some earth shattering things to say about pop culture , except to imply that if you want to be a moron and forego taste , then join the middle-brow masses and get absorbed in soap operas and forego any kind of art that makes you think for yourself . if you do , the director is saying , that is not the worst thing that can happen to you , it doesn't have to kill you . but it is never clear what labute thinks of this , that is , after smashing the middle-class dream of america as something that is drab . is he further saying that it is better to have some dream no matter how futile it is than no dream at all ? if his other two nihilistic films are examples of his thinking , then i think he is trying to bring that same message into this work , even though it might not have been intended in this script and doesn't exactly jive with the sweet ending tried for . i just think it seemed like old hat material recycled . what the film had going for it was some marvelous performances , especially by morgan freeman , who touched the soul of his complicated character , a wickedly carnal performance from chris rock , and from greg kinnear , who caught the subtlety needed for his role , to swing back and forth between tv actor and real character . as for ren ? e zellweger's performance , it was good , that is , as good as any on the soaps . "
698,"a heartfelt australian romance story about a mentally ill couple , which won seven australian academy awards , including best picture , actor , actress and director . there are many magnificent scenes of them showing their love for each other in a sensitive and witty way , also showing how fragile and insecure they are . the director shows how the outsiders only seem to harm them , even when they are trying to be fair with them and offer them sound advise . but we can rest assured that this is not going to be a clich ? movie about the mentally ill and how they manage , as the acting remains controlled and is too earthy for the story to become compromised by a sugary resolution . this is a sensitive film . the director-writer , rymer , makes sure that our sympathies lie entirely with the struggling couple without making the outsiders into monsters . its beauty lies in how honestly the story is told and in showing how difficult it is to find love and then lose it through something you have no control over . it's an absorbing film , that is well-acted and directed , but it is not a film that you might care to remember . it lacked real affection for the couple , as they seemed forced down our throats instead of being allowed to grow gradually on us . having pity for them , is not the same as really caring for them . "
699,"shot almost entirely on digital video with a hand-held camera , miguel arteta's ( star maps ) chuck and buck is an arresting homo-erotic tale about the pangs of growing up while still stuck emotionally at an adolescent stage . these scenes are the heart of the film , as they bring out whatever brilliance there is to be found in the characterizerations , depicting in an honest way how those who are not destined to live a conventional life behave with each other in a natural setting . the film allowed the supporting characters to interact with each other , not going for the cheap comedy it could have gone after by just making fun of buck's tortured character . this makes the supporting characters not that much different than buck as to their feelings of insecurity . a gnawing flaw to this film is that it hits a dead spot , which comes after the play is presented . the thinly disguised autobiographical play , embarrasses chuck . the film seemed to run out of steam at that point , having exhausted itself of its underlying probe into the tormented soul of buck , who is seen more as a pathetic figure who is desperately in need of being touched , someone who does not possess the social skills to relate with others . the film takes a few deep breathes and returns for a discerning conclusion , which was thoroughly credible and well-presented . a tremendous effort by the indie film-makers is realized to tell a moving character study , thereby achieving such a high-quality film on such a low-budget , as it daringly rests its unsentimental case on such a thin plot and succeeds because its characterizations came to life and the effort to look at friendship and human behavior was an honest one . it is also a disarmingly funny movie . "
700,"it was done on an extremely low budget , where the actors received no pay but were promised a percentage of the profits . for this series of films , he thought why not keep the same theme , just switch the story around . it is quite evident that rohmer finds the women in this story more interesting than the men , even if the main woman in it is impossible to understand . this is rohmer before he mastered his craft , but there are signs here of the greatness that was to come in his later films , as its rawness makes up for its lack of sophisticated form and nonstop chatter . nowadays rohmer films are out of favor with modern audiences , and are considered old-fashioned . his films seem to attract an audience mostly aged 50 or older and those looking for something less spectacular to hone in on than what is typically seen in today's films . the film is loaded with an erotic tension , as rohmer's camera remains fixed on her perfect body , her pagan-like bronzed figure and her attractive short-cropped haircut . this film is all about the romantic chase and how these three play it as a game . rohmer puts all of them under the microscope and they become like philosophers . some of the talk is witty but not comical , some of it is merely egotistical babble , but the film never fails to be diverting , aiming for the small dilemmas one has in life as being the most important things , either just or more important than the big world events that influence nations . adrien is the most annoying of the three , being the most smug , the one who counts on his good looks and elitist intellectualism to smother the other person . this is a very wry film not suited for all tastes , but it is a good introduction to the early rohmer , that has a lot to say about human nature and says it in a very french way . the film radiates with the charms derived from so-called sophisticated pleasures and a sneaky sense of perversion . "
701,"the film is slightly offbeat , feeling very natural and human , and offering a chance for the characters to be somewhat fleshed out as they intermingle and search for relationships . the film played well and was enjoyable in poking holes at how insincere and ready for a downfall the main character was , but the obvious plot and the predictable way the film was going , defeated its zen-like approach , wanting too much to resolve things by contrivances instead of surrendering to a more natural ending . yet i enjoyed the film and its loopy moments and thought it did a good job of catching the banter that goes on between the twenty-somethings , struggling to make relationships and fight their fear of loneliness . dex is seen interacting with his roommates in an engaging way , still acting like he hasn't matured . but he has met his match with syd , as the two discuss kierkegaard's dark secret nature and compare it with the opera don giovanni , which takes on the film's theme and makes way for relating that to the eventual transcendence of dex . that this film works in the way most romantic hollywood films work from since when , with its storybook ending intact . . . did not disturb me to the point of dismissing the film . that the script allowed this unlikely romance to succeed no matter what , never deterred it from being a fun film . the film reminded me of those old-fashioned hollywood studio films of the '30s and '40s , only updated to take in the new trends and hip language used by those living in modern times . "
702,"there are also some interesting casting choices he makes such as , a cameo for angie dickinson as gwyneth's grandmother and the noted singer huey newton in a starring role , whose expressions and looks reminded me of sydney pollack . this story is the most bizarre and implausible , but it has the strength of bringing out a number of small truths that add up , allowing the film to maintain a quirky sense of justification for its messiness . its impact is helped greatly by the engagingly nuanced performances of giamatti and braugher . the two things this film has going for it in spades , is the lively karaoke music and the unpredictability of its comedy , which gives the film a very fresh feel , even overcoming the nonsense of its interconnected stories and awkward sense of drama . these stories don't exactly connect for these disenfranchised folks , but it shows what happens to them psychologically when they come to a crossroads in omaha , making it appear to be the super bowl for dreamers in the world of karaoke -- their chance to heal their wounded egos as they steal someone else's talent for a few moments and call it theirs . the film starts off in a karaoke bar in tulsa , where ricky is a karaoke hustler , if there is such an animal as that , it's new to me -- but his thing is to bet other performers that he can top them , betting a huge sum of money over the usual $100 first-place prize . there is also a trip to omaha for the winner , where the competition is national and the prize money is significantly higher at $5 , 000 , but considering the way money has been thrown around in contests with less skill than this one , this is still a very low figure as a payoff . she does a marvelous rendition of "" bette davis eyes . "" but their story was rather tame , as there was nothing touching about their relationship and nothing revealed that wasn't expected , it played as if something was left out but that it wasn't important to find out what that was . yet their chemistry was good together , making their story most watchable one . the story that seemed the most forced was the cabbie and the whore on the run one . this vignette took its dramatics too seriously and explained their obvious emergency relationship in too fine a matter for how absurd it all seemed . i must applaud the film for not emphasizing the competition at the contest , as so many recent commercial films have in such films , and for taking a chance and going for some dramatic fireworks in a screwball comedy . that it doesn't always come together as a fluid film , is pushed aside by how zany and entertaining it was , with a good sense of energy released through some risks that were taken by not trying to put together a familiar film . i have a good feeling about this film and think it will stay around as a cult favorite and grow in status over the years . "
703,"there is no dialogue or narrator in the first version i saw , but in the later version ed mcmahon does the narration . these are some very weird freudian dream sequences . but the narrator poses the question , is it a dream of madness on a dark night -- or was it real ? this is a bizarre film , a precursor to welles' "" touch of evil "" and polansky's "" repulsion . "" if not made to be understandable , it is at least a very demanding depiction of someone demonically possessed by guilt . "
704,"the first-time director does a great job of establishing character in this ensemble production and fully catches the rigors of a working-class milieu , also catching the need for dignity walken has and how the other characters bounce off his understated performance to complement it with their own particular tics . donal logue seems like he's a real guy from the neighborhood , his performance was so real it didn't seem like it was a performance . vera farmiga is as sweet as pie and seemed a natural as the caring daughter . what's there not to like about this robbery ! it is hard for the audience to not root for them to succeed in this victimless caper . it is a film with limited aims , but it has a certain friendliness and charm to it , that credit must go in no small measure to the fine cast and the good eye the director has for what a real neighborhood is like and how working-class people feel . there is a certain grace to this movie , that i think jean-pierre melville would have attested to and welcomed walken into his noir films , as someone bob the gambler would have taken a shine to . the first-time director does a great job of establishing character in this ensemble production and fully catches the rigors of a working-class milieu , also catching the need for dignity walken has and how the other characters bounce off his understated performance to complement it with their own particular tics . donal logue seems like he's a real guy from the neighborhood , his performance was so real it didn't seem like it was a performance . vera farmiga is as sweet as pie and seemed a natural as the caring daughter . what's there not to like about this robbery ! it is hard for the audience to not root for them to succeed in this victimless caper . it is a film with limited aims , but it has a certain friendliness and charm to it , that credit must go in no small measure to the fine cast and the good eye the director has for what a real neighborhood is like and how working-class people feel . there is a certain grace to this movie , that i think jean-pierre melville would have attested to and welcomed walken into his noir films , as someone bob the gambler would have taken a shine to . ozus@sover . net "
705,"it is noted for the understated but tense performance by anthony perkins and the electric and a very passionate performance by geraldine chaplin , where you can actually feel her pain and sympathize with her even though she's the aggressor . setting the dark and torturous mood with her soundtrack is alberta hunter's most appealing blues score , which she also performs . tak fujimoto's camera is sharp in its character delineation , cutting deeply into this tale of revenge with its powerful close-ups . a sense of foreboding violence and a quirky sense of humor go very well together in this film , as emily has this crazed and confused look about her and speaks in an unnatural almost comical tone , as if she forgot how to speak and is learning it anew . she succeeds in messing with neil's life and gains the viewer's sympathy , as she seems to be more of a victim than at first thought . the irony in it , is all the main characters watch the news report , but it is too impersonal for them to even react to it , they are too overwhelmed with the problems in their personal life to care about anyone else . i remembered emily's name by the time the film ended , and felt moved by her strained performance and all the emotions , pathos , and humor that was in it . the film was too arty at times , as is the want of the director , but it is a gripping film , one that i recommend for the way it outstandingly depicts the subtleties in the way the characters act . "
706,"a thrilling but shamelessly manipulative political thriller , the second feature dealing with presidential politics from the director who was once a film critic , rod lurie ( deterrence ) . he has vastly honed his skills as a filmmaker in comparison with his debut film , which was a failure artistically and commercially . "" the contender "" is a film that is grounded in having a clear understanding of how politically underhanded and sly the system is and how those in it operate on a level that would make machiavelli proud of them . i was taken aback by how great the entire ensemble cast is , with the leads being superb in getting the maximum out of their juicy roles , even if they have to chew the scenery to do it . the cast is so good that it overcomes the shrill oratory , the manipulative , obvious and unbelievable political situations , and an ending that tries to play it so safe , that it takes away the juice in the story that gave this film its power in the first place . i thoroughly enjoyed it , even though i knew it was a manipulative film , trying to get me to bite at its revelations about the double-standards between men and women politicians , without giving me a fair chance to swallow everything without choking on what i was asked to swallow . this only occurs when he orders something ordinary -- a muenster cheese sandwich . there was something about that action that didn't seem right . it will later on play an important part in the film's plot . it makes the viewer face the fact that a woman in high office is still a woman and has to be accepted just like a man in that position would be . hanson refuses to comment on the issue , taking the high moral ground , saying it is no one's business but her own . senator hanson is seen as both a liberal and a vegetarian . the story in itself is more soap opera than drama , but what gives it verve is the super performances from the three stars , jeff bridges , gary oldman , and joan allen . they give depth to their roles and they are all seen in many different lights and shades . jeff bridges steals every scene he is in , offering a fascinating look at a president who could be likable though sinister , sneakily clever , and also very politically human in a generous and gracious way . he was thoroughly believable as an updated bill clinton-type , post-lewinsky . this film is a pro-clinton one , taking aim at those who dig up dirt and cast aspersions in a hypocritical way , when it is evident that both sides are capable of using the same bag of dirty tricks to further their own cause . the film was fascinating when it didn't have a message to deliver with some bogus pat speech and , instead , set up a logical argument showing that senator hanson should be confirmed for office despite allegations of her youthful sex scandal . "
707,"this pleasing film plays like a docudrama , with the director youssef chahine playing himself in the film . he feels amr is an even better actor than he was , and therefore feels hurt that amr is threatening to walk away from this part . chahine said he was quite sure that he was talking to him , as he was a young man sitting intently in the audience , quite in awe of the great actor . yet , when the shoot is over , amr tells how kind and considerate the director could be when off the set . it reminded me of a jacques rivette musical , mixing reality and fantasy into a scene where you wouldn't think it possible to do so . cahine goes on to make two more pictures in this film within a film , alexandria and cleopatra . the scenes are colorfully shot on a studio location , while it also shows him writing and directing the actors , as they go from song and dance numbers into serious acting sketches . the creative , political and personal struggles of the filmmaker were well-presented and superbly acted , in this imaginative and enchanting production . it is a zesty film , adopting many different themes and styles , from gene kelly dance numbers to fellini fantasy scenes . "
708,"a screwball comedy set in harrisburg , pa . , in 1988 , where the ethics for the main characters become so twisted allowing everyone in the film to be perceived as either an incompetent jerk or an incompetent crook . nora ephron directs this farce with the aim to mine all the laughs taken from the foibles of the slow-witted characters and pull all the nuggets out of their characterizations that adam resnick scripted , as the film holds up rather well until the clumsily navigated tidied up ending , which made no ethical sense . the film's main assets are in the sterling cast , who all have a flair for making their roles brim with comedy . the key ingredient to this comedy , is john travolta , who was never better in a comic role , and the good chemistry between him and lisa kudrow , who as a sexpot with a heart of steel , is just fabulous in making her character both despicable and amusingly likable . we see in the opening moments , that he's a narcissistic jerk but one who's so corny and willing to please , that he's oddly acceptable as a human being . it was a brilliant comic set-up , which gave the film a delicious comic aroma . for this one mistake , he is made to suffer for it during the entire film . his slow-thinking process and keen sense of timing to draw out the comic situation , made his role a very funny one . this was a satisfying comedy ( the best way to judge a comedy is if you are laughing -- and , i was ) . it was effortlessly well-acted , with plenty of sight gags and changes of facial expression on the bewildered characters to make almost every scene a funny one . "" lucky numbers "" didn't hit the jackpot , as the story was too shallow to allow for that , but i got some good comedy action for the price of the movie ticket . "

711,"a solid noir melodrama from vincent sherman , who takes a standard story and dresses it up with moving characterizations and beautifully expressionistic b&w photography from cinematographer james wong howe . the director took a songwriter paul webster's short magazine story called "" the man who died twice "" and improved the story by rounding out the characters to give them both strong and weak points , so that they would not be one-note characters as was the case in the original story . the movie posters said , 'if you were nora prentiss , would you keep your mouth shut ? ' the other famous quote from this film is 'a mouth like hers is just for kissing . . . not for telling ! ' the film proved to be popular with the public , especially with the women in the audience , and it turned out to be a big hit for ann sheridan . the glossy story might not be much on paper , but the telling of it was superb , showing how trapped the main characters became because of their lie . "
712,"the film is told from his view of things . it is a deliberate film , doing a grand job of setting up the characters and the tough situation they are in , with the visuals telling the story as powerfully as it can . the brick fights between the rival gangs and the angst of the mother , not understanding what to do , seemed genuine , in this semi-autobiographical work by the mackinnon brothers , gillies and billy . spoiler in the next paragraph about the film's ending . it is a film that tried to say more than what it is capable of saying , but when it was on message , it had a stunning affect , showing how the lack of good parenting and a poor environment could be deadly . it caught something real about growing up in such a rough environment , but the acting was not that great by the kids and when all is said and done , the brothers were made into stock characters . "
713,"this is a quintessential john ford western . there are all his stock characters present , the rousing song to stir one's heart is there as the cavalry troops ride by with stan jones singing 'i left my love , ' there is the formula story of the men in order to be respected proving themselves in combat , and finally the film has ford's ongoing patriotic message that this country is for everyone who has the guts to fight for it . the film proves more interesting than its predictable outcome because of ford's odd touches in certain scenes and john wayne , who is who he is , giving the film a powerful symbol . there is no plan made for how they are to return to friendly territory , except they should incur as few casualties as possible . ford is more interested in the characters in the story than the story itself . secord does his job but is too ambitious and sleazy to be thought of as a hero . ford does not put up with cowards in his films . the film has a lot of gory scenes of surgery , which included showing the amputation of a leg . in ford's oeuvre , this film would rate somewhere in the middle or slightly better than that , it couldn't quite get past all its static formula presentations to be a great film , but it threw out some diverting ideas , making it a greater film than a typical western .

714,"an amazingly strange film , confusing and not thoroughly enjoyable , but a film i found more interesting than i thought possible at first viewing . this experimental film in minimalist story telling , a film consisting of disturbing visualizations and almost no dialogue , had a concept that was greater than how the film turned out . it felt at times like i was watching paint dry on the wall , but the reward for sitting through those excruciatingly redundant scenes , was in seeing something different , something that cast a spell of sorcery over a terrible incident , as i believe the film in its unique and sometimes shrill voice does justice in commenting on the violence in american society , especially against women . the film uses its impressions of the marine base as a metaphor for the social violence in today's american society , and to give it its startling look of reality , marines were used as the actors . the plot is simple . the film's boredom is broken up by camera shots of marines in conversations that we can't hear in its entirety but are treated to little snippets of , hearing mostly their curse words . because the film had no linear story and followed no chronological order , and it stressed the mundaneness of life on the base and did not film its story in the usual way a murder investigation is filmed , it appeared surreal . i thought these additions seemed to serve mostly as unneeded arty pretext . the unsettling milieu in which the crime took place , speaks volumes about why the murder might have taken place . the film seems to be telling us that it's up to us to make sense of what we've seen . though the film was dull and did not move me while i was watching it , it did something to me afterwards intellectually , it made me think of a military base , the persian gulf war , and of marital abuse , but it made me think of them without the usual concepts i bring to my thinking cap . does that make this a great film ? no . but it makes it an interesting one , a film that i can't easily dismiss . its filming of the arrest is so chilling and memorable because what is so dull and ordinary about the crime scene , is the understated reason for the origin of the violence , contrary to the way hollywood films portray violence . here it is a part of the landscape that one regularly sees but , perhaps , one doesn't really understand or want to understand what evil society has created .

715,"don roos ( "" the opposite of sex "" ) , the director-screenwriter , has come up with a smart script and lets his adult stars act like real adults do and is not ashamed of the glossy film becoming a tearjerker , and when the romance story tugs shamelessly at my heart it feels good because there is a heartfelt rhythm in this film that allowed me to clearly see what the troubled couple is feeling without it seeming to be contrived , even though it is contrived . in fact , the film is thoroughly engrossing and well-crafted until the closing scenes , where some speeches are made to clear the air , which seemed totally unnecessary . what helped carry the film through such contrived spots , was the real-life romantic couple who star in the film , ben affleck and gwyneth paltrow , playing two hurt souls who don't expect to fall in love but do . they had great chemistry onscreen , and paltrow in particular , seemed to make the story appealing and credible . in the hollywood tradition of such love stories , it seemed easy for the audience to root for them to get together and make the romance work . the only thing is , that the film is a little tougher than how most mainstream films do romances but is not edgy enough to be an art film , so it falls into the category of being not one or the other type of film , which might cause it to be ignored by both audiences . sex is not presented as the prize here , as much as a serious and meaningful relationship is . it has probably been ages since that theme was tried as seriously as it was in this mainstream film , and that just might be the most refreshing thing about the film . since paltrow is the better actor , she mops up the screen in these scenes of anguish and is convincing as someone who has been damaged and is afraid of getting hurt again . affleck is good as an actor conveying someone who is arrogant and shallow and full of false bravado , but is not convincing as someone who has been down for the count and is bouncing back as a changed man . it left me wondering , how sensitive of a person could he really have become , if he could only help her materially and not understand that his drinking masked deeper problems he had in his character , such as lying ! but the film had enough of a realistic romance under its belt to not be buried for dead with its contrivances . in additition it had some pretty good players in supporting roles . joe morton always gives a fine performance , and here as the sturdy , no-nonsense businessman he grounds the film in some needed reality . this modest production scored with me . and if it didn't have that phony civil court scene at the end , with affleck forced to act in such a disingenuously apologetic manner , the film would have been much better . but i was glad to be taken in by what i was seeing onscreen , that is an adult romantic film , with the adults interested in having a real relationship . i'm so conditioned by now , that i think only foreign films or art house films operate that way . "
716,"without any proof , ellen fails to believe him . the story had a lot of holes in it , including an inadequate explanation for budd's motivation for wanting dorothy dead in the first place , but it still played as a good nightmarish mystery yarn , with an icy robert wagner tremendous in a villain role for a change of pace from his usual good guy roles . "
717,"this is a creaky horror film , with plenty of fun moments in its wobbly story . it is played mostly as a spoof on vampires , but has a nifty murder mystery going for it , plus some gimmicky camera work featuring an apparition and the scary dark castle filled with strange sounds , cobwebs , spiders , bats , and rodents . he tries to steal the picture by hamming it up , even though he only has one line in the film . but the biggest ham is barrymore , he makes every line into a stage-like performance . this amusing b&w film , with photography by james wong howe , captures the eerie atmosphere befitting a horror film . it's a classic horror spoof , well worth seeing for either nostalgia purposes or lighthearted fun . "
718,"bruce robinson , the creative director and writer of "" withnail and i , "" has come up once again with an original film , which again stars richard e . grant . "" how to get ahead in advertising "" is a tirade against the phony world of advertising and the screams denouncing that industry seemed like sweet music to my ears up to a point , as the message of the film eventually moved from being funny to becoming shrill and overwhelming , even to someone like me who was sympathetic to the script . ad men could very well be the lowest souls on the food chain on planet earth , is a point that doesn't have to be nailed into me before i get it . the point being made , is that both the business world and the world of science are ready to sell almost any product to make a buck , as they both exist by giving the public what they want . this is a film that rants on throughout , as it starts off very funny and then moves into sermonizing about the corrupt industry . the huckster's motto being : if you want to sell pimple cream , you have to encourage people to have pimples . the cast play their parts with the earnest intensity and gullibility required , with richard grant showing a lot of energy and a tremendous ability to verbalize . it's an unusual picture , one worth a look at for those who don't mind pure nuttiness instead of dramatics and tension in a story . it sounds far-reaching , a ghastly cry against the excesses of materialism , or does it ? "
719,"a snappy b-film thriller , excellently paced for broad sweeps of comedy and fright . lew ayres stars in a film he says in a magazine interview , "" is the kind of picture actors do when they need work . "" basil rathbone , who was a big star at the time of this film , had a small part as the villain . ayres is endearing as the misunderstood actor who will only be with a woman who doesn't lie . together they make an engaging couple , bringing a wonderful sense of lightness to their roles . the story is as clear as mud , but the performances from the stars was sparkling . and , even though the film might be dated , it's still a lot of fun . "
720,"somehow this quirky , egocentric , fantasy black-and-white film about a british filmmaker learning to dance the tango from a master , works in an obscure way by getting us hooked on what's going on . it works so well because the dancing was so natural and magnificently performed , even if the wistful romantic story never caught my imagination and the philosophizing about her being a jew seemed more diverting than engrossing ( in real-life she's not jewish but an avowed atheist who was only influenced by her jewish neighbors and their culture ) . the 48-year-old sally potter ( she plays herself ) , while filming in paris a technicolor thriller ( it seemed like dreck and is probably some kind of personal statement potter is making about hollywood films ) about a legless fashion designer in a wheelchair murdering models dressed in brightly colored costumes . "" i've always wanted to be in films , "" says the thirtysomething pablo . it sounds like a trade-off in self-indulgences , and all i can say , is why not ! when sally dances the tango in the film , that's really her and not a double . and if she can dance the part , why not play the part ! for whatever arcane reason ( or most likely no reason at all ) , the story has twelve dance lessons which come to divide the film into chapters . she returns to paris after being disappointed that her hollywood backers complained that it would be better for the box office if the film was to be in english instead of french and that she should cast a different villain because it would be difficult to cast a legless person . she shoots back , "" you danced as a soloist -- like a stranger -- and i lost you . "" somehow i couldn't be convinced of their romance , in fact , i never cared about it . it seemed empty , and to the bargain she's no beauty . but . . . ah ! those dancing scenes were tremendous , along with the penetrating cinematography of the great robby m ? ller , giving the film such a stunning look . the film managed to look good and even though pablo and sally are no great shakes as actors , and their stiff romance was more pitiful than meaningful , the film had a bizarre strain to it , of this very uptight sally learning how to loosen up and the sly pablo jumping around like a fox at a hunt . it seemed to be a mix of reality and script , but hard to tell which was which . when they weren't dancing or figuring out what kind of arrangement they were going to have , such as if their dancing partnership would include any funny business , they discussed what it is like being a jew . i couldn't quite warm up to this debate about art . the film is short on plot , short on acting , short on getting me involved in the romance , but most of the film had potter and veron dancing and that had me jumping with joy , even believing that there was something spiritual to the tango , a dance which is a mixture of cuban and european styles , created by the lower-classes and elevated to the status of the ballroom , a dance created in this century , that maybe is even akin to the rapturous eastern european klezmer music . this is an inspiring dance film that covers some ground in exploring what the tango is and how that dance reflect's one's life and suffering , and to understand that is to begin to understand what the tango is about and what this film was trying to get at . "
721,"a steamy noir for its time , featuring the sultry , long hair-tossing rita hayworth , the hard-boiled glenn ford , and the sinister george macready . this is sexpot rita's finest moment in films as an actress and chanteuse , which enshrined her as the love goddess of the 1940s . this theme takes hold of this dark film and overshadows the milder intrigue about macready , himself a nazi collaborator , fronting for a nazi-controlled tungsten cartel . a fascinating film for all the dark avenues it opened up sexually for future films . the film is all style and charismatic acting . the story is absurd and could not be anything but risible , if if wasn't for the bizarre performances by the stars to give it credibility . the clearest summation of the story comes in the film's most sensational and memorable scene , as gilda is dressed in a tight-fitting black satin evening gown and sings 'put the blame on mame , ' intoning in an erotic manner what is eating away at johnny while suggesting a full striptease by removing a glove . spoiler in the next paragraph . skip if you don't want to know how the story is resolved . rita was simply stupendous here and makes this slight b-film a memorable one . the film could be viewed as a study in the main characters' pathologies and of a peeling away of the unconscious , highlighted by the hinting of a quasi-gay relationship between macready and glenn , where they only care about loyalty and do not seem to care what else they have in common . this emotionally charged love triangle is better acted than its silly story sounds . it's a studio film , with even its revealing carnival scene , an unloading of sexual repression and delve into the unconscious , done indoors on the cheesy hollywood set . "
722,"the payoff in the film comes in a slick surprise ending , as now has become the custom of the director and is what the audience expects . night has honed his skills from his previous films by showing an improvement in technique and filmmaking style , while continuing his penchant for making films with box-office pop . though there is a certain disdainful emptiness in this film , as there was in his others , but this film sustains itself with the keen performances by the understated one bruce willis gives and the punctiliously perverse one samuel l . jackson gives , as the film is able to amble along at its leisurely pace , building on character development and the unique relationship the two stars develop , until the mystery story takes hold in the last twenty minutes and puts the exclamation point on the far-fetched tale it was weaving . this subdued action film is unlike other action-hero films , as the action is not the thing here . what counts the most , is what secret the film is covering up and why . it is especially delightful for those who like puzzlers and think they can gather enough clues to take a stab at guessing the outcome . even though night has matured as a director , this surprise ending is not as engaging as the one he came up with in the blockbuster the sixth sense , which caught audiences completely off-guard . but this film is a more mature work and has fuller characterizations . so the former has arguably a better ending , but this one is a better realized overall film . the basic plot is simple . as his face changes expressions , we can sense something tragic is about to happen . elijah believes that david may be the 'unbreakable' person he is looking for , someone to give hope for this mediocre age we live in , as he believes the super-hero myth is as true as if it was history -- which is asking a lot for an adult audience to swallow , but . . . that's hollywood ! and if he has a weakness , it might be water , as even superman had a weakness from kryptonite . his reasoning supposes -- "" if there is someone like me in the world , shouldn't there be someone at the other end of the spectrum ? "" the major stumbling block , to this otherwise involving film , is the let down in the third act . the action in it seemed obligatory and not really germane to the story , as an anonymous psycho serial killer is introduced to prove that david has the super-powers of the comic book hero . this encounter , of him stopping the violent psychopath killer never worked right , as it seemed flat and arbitrary , spoiling but not ruining the overall achievement of the film . what this unconventional mainstream film did right for itself , was to provide a modern type of super-hero for an audience that thrives on escapist films that can fill them with some hope that there's a savior out there in the fight between good and evil ( something hollywood films could always be counted on to provide the public with ) . it is a film that is confident enough of its ability to tell its story that it doesn't have to rely on special effects . and , perhaps , as an homage to hitchcock or maybe it's a case of egomania , night once again appears in his own film . "
723,"it is artfully directed by leconte , with his choppy camera work matching the mediterranean's bubbly sea movements and the trembling nature of the feature players , plus his smoothly dark photography makes it seem as if he's filming a 1940s noir work , and his eclectic musical background soundtracks ( ranging from benny goodman to marianne faithfull and from italian to turkish music ) adds an excitement to a story that changes moods from comical to tragical at the drop of a knife . it should be noted , in the director's biggest joke he has with the audience , how the background music plays a large part in the enjoyment of the film . when the film is playful and lighthearted , it is sublime and masterfully done . unfortunately , when the last reel comes , the film shifts gears and starts to take its philosophical musings about chance and luck seriously , and the film becomes contrived and loses much of its punch . the power in the film's punch comes mostly from the imaginative performances of international pop star vanessa paradis , the girlfriend of johnny depp , and from one of france's most popular and best actors , daniel auteuil . these two have an electricity together that is , indeed , magical , with both featuring very expressive facial gestures and large eyes that open wider when welcoming the viewer into their story in a most hospitable way . perhaps any film with subtitles ( especially subtitles that are hard to read ) and one that is shot in black-and-white , can only be relegated to a select audience . or , maybe , a knife-thrower act in a circus venue is art in america , while in paris it might be viewed as the old -- seen that , done that thing . she is so persuasive , that we know everything about her that we have to from this brief opening look at her , so much so that when she shifts her eyes , we even know what she is thinking . now that's the start of a lifetime friendship , if you ask me . there was something bizarre about the act that was movie magic . . . fake magic , i grant you , but magical enough to keep me glued to my seat in anticipation of what will happen to her , as leconte also had the circus sideshow entourage gasping with concern . i think he might even have expected the theater viewer to be masturbating over this . my favorite tryst , was her and the contorsionnist making it on top of the piano ( the sex act itself is only imagined and is tastefully not seen -- but can you imagine how they did it ? ) . the film then moves off the map of credible filmmaking and becomes silly and contrived , probably imitative of those cartoonish-like action films , where there is a daring helicopter rescue of the couple adrift at sea . for a film that was so sublime and had such an enchanting mystical romance going for it , it foolishly throws that all away to make its cheap points about chance and to show how if two souls that fit together like two halves of a money bill , will only have value if it does not get torn apart , which is too heavy-handed a message for this bubbly film to handle . the film should have been a more far-reaching one and it could have been much funnier if it didn't go on the wrong cruise toward the end . but what we have is still a visually spellbinding film and one where vanessa and danny prove to be very human creatures , who are worth caring about . what i still came up with , is that they are both good at flirting with disaster , but what they both have in spades , is a whimsical sense of humor and a strange sense of survival , and just like serge frydman's script , which was both witty and superfluous , the film nevertheless succeeded in sucking me into its story , a story which probably implied more about it than it actually delivered . but , despite this and that about it that seemed to me as if it was drifting off into the territory of play acting , i still thought it was a smart film . "
724,"in reality that was a time of great poverty and unrest and this film serves as a humanistic response to that age of intolerance and greed , though the film does not make a direct political statement . this is his first film in ten years and it is sponsored by the chinese government , and one of its chief faults is that the film used bad film stock , as it seemed out of focus and grainy . on the positive side , it is a colorful and heart-tugging though highly manipulative melodrama , filled with obvious reactions against injustices , but whose voice is always on the side of the artist and those who are disenfranchised in society . the film will go on to dispel china's ancient notions that a girl is not as valuable as a boy . the film becomes predictable , as it shows how they are both shaped by their experiences of the hard-times they live in and by the traditions . as a result , when the film's last act rolls around , what happens all feels contrived and overacted , and i felt manipulated , especially when i saw that the sweet little girl is even willing to die for her grandpa . though the viewer is being shamelessly manipulated , the story feels so strong and right , that it seems easy to get caught up in the emotions of the moment and the beautifully arranged images that lit the screen up with magical faces and gorgeous sets and costumes . the film got ever so mushy , but it was so cleverly executed and i was gladly taken in by zhou ren-ying and zhu xu pulling on my heart strings . "
725,"a nifty postmodern cowboy-noir and black comedy , filmed in a drab technicolor that seems appropriate for this film , as the colorization is not ostentatious and thereby makes the characters appear more real . the story is aimed at striking your funny bone and getting you dizzy in following all the plot twists . it features all the familiar noir clich ? s : femme fatale , an innocent man trapped in the world of criminals , and is written by the dahl brothers and directed with tongue-in-cheek humor by john dahl , and despite the clich ? s , the film feels original . it's the type of film that seems to be best-suited for video , where it still made its biggest splash . but not our hero . . . who is neither straight nor crooked , just a guy who gets into tight spots and tries to do what is right . all this happens in the first reel . "" red rock west "" is a playful and off-beat thriller , whose only sense it makes is nonsense , but one that is highly entertaining , while the film itself is well executed and the acting is dead-pan funny . so it hardly matters that this murky story is not plausible and certainly not cerebral . it has received cult status because of its many plot twists and zany characters , which means it will pop up on late night cable at any time in the future and that should be for years to come . "
726,"honestly . spoiler in the next paragraph . their superb characterizations about the cowboy's hard life and romantic visions , living as loners , often traveling on dusty roads into one-horse towns while hanging out in tawdry bars , gives this film a special force , filled with a moody noirish atmosphere . "
727,"this made-for-tv thriller provides plenty of mystery . it's a story that crosses religion and spiritualism with worldly cynicism and murder . arquette is excellent in an understated performance . robards brings a certain sense of tragic power to his role . while under the capable direction of mike hodges ( get carter ) , the film is superbly paced and plays up the ambiguity of the story in a satisfactory manner . the result is a stimulating film for the intellect and a challenge for establishing what one's reality is . "
728,"carol reed's breakthrough film as a director after a long and undistinguished film career . are just trying to figure out what to do that is right . he does not care that he would only be healing johnny so that the fugitive could be executed . that only help given without expecting something from it , is truly a christian charity . londoner reed has shot a pro-british film , that is stronger on being a suspenseful art film than an accurately political one . the dark rainy streets of belfast and the brooding mood of mason , made this film look much like a noir feature . it is preachy in spots , trying to show many different sides to the struggle , where characters along the way seem more like symbols than real flesh-and-blood . but the film was very weak in setting up the political arguments that caused the civil war in the first place , as no rational person will disagree with the film's anti-violent stance . but there is a lot going on that the film left uncovered from the point of view of what the revolutionaries are protesting . i found the film , nevertheless , absorbing , especially as a thriller--a 'cops and robbers' tale . "
729,"a very good sequel to "" the invisible man ( 33 ) , "" though not as imaginative as the original . the search for the killer was too obvious to be interesting , but the fun to be had was when the side effects to the serum kicked in and geoffrey became egomaniacal . the film received a nomination for a special effects oscar in 1941 . "
730,"a risky commercial venture that sometimes works in a serious way but is somewhat beaten down by the lack of vision it exhibits while in its romantic mode , as opposed to how alluring it was as a moralistic survival film . the film is carried solely by tom hanks' splendid performance , with him reflecting without the need of dramatics or dialogue the changes he is going through , as he acts through use of facial expressions and body language . the adventure story is reminiscent of a modern-day robinson crusoe tale , and is divided into three distinct parts , with tom hanks being the film's mainstay . the striking visuals and penetrating silence , give this film a surprising depth to its storytelling . he converses with it as if it were a human companion . there were times that this island fare seemed mildly poetic , but at other times it began to wear heavy as time dragged with only tom hanks on the screen to keep the fire going . yet the film had a certain appeal to it . . . a boldness not often seen in commercial films , as it bravely did without dialogue for great parts of the island story . this lent a certain sense of unpredictability to it and made the simple story lend itself to being more introspective and interestingly perceived . the major fault of the film lies in the capricious ending , where it ran out of story and didn't know how to make hanks' return to memphis and civilization shed some light on what he's been through without trivializing that experience . but what didn't resonate was the ambiguity of the film's ending . that is the simple point the film is trying to make and where the film should have ended , but when it tries to reinforce its sappy love story with characters who had too little screen time to have an effect on the story and it forces corny words on those characters in order to resolve hanks' love situation , the film thereby loses something by its hollywoodish formulaic message it tries desperately to land safely on . otherwise , a pleasing film from the director of forrest gump , robert zemeckis . one of his better ones . . . with the adventure part of the film having some appeal though not delving deep enough into the survivor's psyche for it to have an even greater appeal . but it was far superior to that recently popular survivor tv show , which had more to do about making a million bucks than surviving . "
731,"the magic in the film did not come from the light comedy and the overworked romantic situation , which was mindful of a french farce , but from the sexy chemistry caught on the screen between the two and the way they looked natural dancing together . filmed during the heart of the depression , the film makes it a point to show how extravagant the rich lived , with not a care in the world for money . when he isn't scheming , he goes into the various song and dance numbers , some solo , some with her , and there's lots of verbal sparring to keep the film highly energized . the film's showdown takes place in venice , which is an artificially staged version of that great city , where madge is staying in this opulent but gaudy art deco hotel , waiting to play matchmaker and introduce jerry to dale . this catchy romantic farce should hit the mood of those in need of lighthearted escapism to cheer them up ; and with its show stopping musical routines , it has reached the status of being a film classic . it seems to be one of those films that doesn't get dated , and that glorious climax of "" cheek to cheek , "" with fred and ginger dancing as lovers , should lighten the hearts of those movie romantics out there . this sweeping musical , filmed in b&w , is delightful whether on video -- or if one is lucky enough to see it in on widescreen at a retrospective theater showing , then all the better . "
732,"warning : the review includes an important spoiler in the first and last paragraph . there's a surprise that is revealed during the end credits : this fascinating documentary turns out to be a mock-documentary , after it hits you over the head with the problems facing many american workers during the changing times of the 1990s and spends the entire film looking like a real documentary . russ hexter , the 27-year-old writer-director , unexpectedly died of an aortic aneurysm shortly after shooting the innovative film , cutting short a possible brilliant career . the chasm between the locals and the newcomers is enormous , being caused mostly by a cultural clash . that it was not for real , does take away a lot of the film's impact and poignancy , but still it leaves the viewer with a sense that it cut through something perplexing that is currently happening , that is part of the human drama that causes some strange behavior to emerge . hexter has thrown open a look at all the social , political , and economic factors involved in the evolution of a small town , and he has done a nice job in showing the human tragedy above all else as being the most important thing to consider , even though in the bigger picture things might look like they are working out , there's still a face you have to put on someone who loses his job . "
733,"i guess to really enjoy this film , you would have to speak the language to understand its poetical nuances , otherwise the poetry as presented didn't seem like much . as well-acted and crafted a film as this directorial debut was for ismail merchant , it still failed to make the story interesting for a wider audience , as the poetry fell on deaf western ears even though the story's heart seemed to be in the right place . the film still seemed to be too dry to care about an unfamiliar muslim language and an intellectual culture no longer in vogue , dying a slow death . as worthwhile a project as it is , as adapted from anita desai's 1987 novel , in which she also does the screenplay , it still is hard to bring an intact literary work and make it viable as a cinematic experience without changing it . the film's main failure is that it never comes to life as a moving poetical work but always seems like an academic exercise , through no fault of the director . the amateur poet in urdu is more than pleased to do so , though he does not feel secure that he is up to the task . he finally manages to squeeze a little money out of the college registrar , saying that he will make a tape-recording and the college can have the poet's voice to use as a valuable resource for its classes . the flawed poet has the even larger task , of being viewed as a symbol for the entire urdu tradition . it must have been a cultural thing , because it went by me . to me , her performance seemed as if it was as gaudy as an esther williams bathing suit number in a hollywood pulp film . but he is more harmful than helpful . these scenes were played as lowbrow comedy , showing the clumsiness of deven in handling the tapes and the awkward situation he was in . the acting performances by shashi kapoor and om puri deserve special praise . but i'm afraid the film was too stilted and unmoving ; and , it failed to capture the beauty of the ancient poetical language on film . "
734,"the first thing you should be aware of about this controversial 1960 political film , shot in b&w by godard's favorite cinematographer raoul coutard , is that it was not shown until 1963 , as it had scenes in it that involved torture and terrorist tactics carried out by both the algerians and the french while waging the algerian war , which did not sit well with the french government that the public be made aware of this . writer-director jean-luc godard ( breathless ) allows his opinions to supercede the story line , making his films sound preachy and him self-indulgent . he often paints big political pictures that easily fall into generalizations . in his political assessments he is just as apt to be artless as he is to be riveting . that is the case in his second feature , the brooding atmospheric "" le petit soldat .

735,"this is the movie not the perfume . a slow moving , stylish psychological thriller in imitation of hitchcock's vertigo . it is adapted from an original story by brian de palma and paul schrader , and is directed by de palma and scripted by schrader . the surprises to come weren't really all that surprising , as the beauty in the storytelling is almost exclusively in the understated acting by the soul stricken cliff robertson , the emotionally impactful performance by genevi ? ve bujold , and the competent acting of john lithgow . it plays too much like a rehash of the master's work , to break any new ground , yet it is still thrilling in its own way . "
736,"testament of dr . the film was well-crafted , perfectly photographed in b&w , as it maintained a breezy pace and threw into the story some comedy and romance . they are not told how they will die until they hear a loud ticking sound . the whole feel of the movie is that it's brilliant hokum . aside from its serious political message , this was a slapstick comedy , and a mystery story much influenced by those american serials , which were very popular at the time . it is definetly worth seeing . "
737,"but in robert altman's gentle and perceptive comedy , this is not enough . appropriately enough , this is a film set in the fall , and the mood and the color of the film reflects that time of year , in all its beauty and in its surprisingly stormy weather . she is baffled by her problem , but surmises it's a rare mythological complex that she suffers from , that affects only upper-class women who are loved too much and come to reject this love , retreating into a childlike state . she concurs that if anyone would know , it's him . at last , after many recent bombs , gere has found a film that goes hand in hand with his laconic style and intelligent grace , as he plays a sympathetic character , someone who seems very comfortable with this dazzling role around so many women and comes across as a good doctor and a generous person who is trying his best to be the man around a sea of women . there doesn't seem to be much tragedy here , it seems that script writer anne rapp and the 75-year-old altman are only gently chiding the doctor for thinking he can ever understand women , and the film plays more like a big joke on him than anything else . what unravels for him , are all things he can easily rebound from , as the film ends with the song "" ain't it something the way things go "" being played as the credits roll by , after an unpredictable ending to a sweetly bizarre film . "
738,"this is a slight film as far as subject matter but it is richly endearing as a road movie that is a comedy-drama-romance-thriller rolled into one film , boasting big-time star power in brad pitt and julia roberts . it mostly roams between being a silly roughhouse crime caper and a film with some intimate moments shared through conversation . the well-crafted story is about a special 19th century pistol called "" the mexican . "" margolese makes it clear that he must possess this valuable item or else . this long separation didn't disappoint me , but it might disappoint some who expected to see a more romantic story develop between the two stars . director gore verbinski ( mouse hunt ) does a nice job tightening up this rambling story when it needed it and keeping the action flowing , though a few of the comedy scenes , such as the one that opens the film , seemed contrived . julia roberts plays a familiar part to her by now , of someone who doesn't have all her smarts , who is very likable when sticking to her work-type characterization of someone trying to get in touch with her feelings through reading self-help books and having conversations about sensitive topics . her chemistry is very good with pitt , but is sensational with gandolfini , as they provide the film with its main stimulus of comedy , rauchiness , violence , and good conversation . all these characters were well-defined and screenwriter j . h . wyman deserves much of the credit for that , as he also embellished the story with excellent dialogue and enough plot twists and surprises to keep crime film buffs guessing at what happens next . while cinematographer dariusz wolski's location shots of the beautiful mountain town of real de catorce were spectacular and made this a very pleasing mainstream film to view . "
739,"zhang yimou ( "" raise the red lantern "" ) has securely grounded a "" feel good "" film with characters who have greatly touched me , even though the film is bogged down with much communist propaganda and it ends like a typical hollywood "" feel good "" movie , in this case with too much good cheer over nothing much accomplished to make it so proud about itself . nevertheless , this is a brilliantly directed austere film for the most part , telling about ordinary people in a very poor , rural village in china's hebei province . it held my interest as i observed the classroom dynamics taking place in a broken down one-room schoolhouse and in the contrasting lifestyle shown in the modern chinese city . these are human interest stories i have not seen before about the new china , presented here in such an informal way . the cast of mostly nonprofessional actors , playing themselves , acquitted their task with a spirited performance , giving power to the story about the problems with rural education for the poor people of that region . the characters should be about the size of a donkey turd . but the mayor will not give her transportation to the city and shrugs his shoulder , saying that's just the way it is with poor people around here . this leads to the only lesson she ever thought , as she has the children do the math for this real-life problem , of trying to figure out how many bricks it would take to move before she has enough for round-trip bus fare . it's a communal effort , since her math is not much better than her student's . this looked so unreal , that i thought the last reel got mixed in with one of those typical hollywood films of this kind . though , what was interesting about this part of the film , was taking a gander at the city and how clean and boring and crowded it looked . the message of the film was unnecessarily delivered in a heavy-handed manner , about the poor conditions of china's rural schools . the film was so adeptly done and looked and felt so good , and the parts of all the people were played by those playing themselves in such a natural way , that i didn't see its downfall coming until it was too late and , anyway , by that time i was really getting off on the film and was amazed by the simple daily life rhythms of the schoolchildren and the common villagers , that i was already hooked on liking the film . i especially found the performance of wei minzhi to be impactful . this fictional story was better than the message delivered , and the film is much better than it sounds , given the aforementioned flaws it has , it still shows the power of human love over all the coldness in the world . "
740,"his most memorable role was in the lodger as jack the ripper , a film that was similar to this one , only presented in a more subtle psychological framework and became recognized as one of the more interesting serial killer films made . warning : spoiler in the next paragraph . cregar gave a nightmarish performance that was staggering and memorable , while linda darnell was alluring as the scheming chanteuse . this is a fast-paced b&w suspense yarn , one that held my attention throughout . it is also noted for its exciting bernard herrmann score whenever the action picks up . "
741,"it's a routine revenge western but , nevertheless , has elements of the quirkiness peckinpah's films will later on become reknown for . this film is visually powerful in spots , as it overcomes its routine theme with burning images of lust , greed , and hatred . maureen sings the film's theme song during the opening and closing credits . "
742,"a good story is infused with too much symbolic pretentiousness , yet the overall effect is absorbing . the film won an academy award for best screenplay and director for john huston , while his father walter huston won for best supporting actor . it was nominated for best film , but lost to hamlet . this black and white film is very well acted , especially by bogie and walter huston , but is not as gripping and intriguing as john huston's masterpiece -- "" the maltese falcon . "" "
743,"the film follows potter's gimmicky style of having the characters jump into lip-synched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private thoughts . the tale has resnais's unique touches as a director to go along with his homage . it is a satire about class differences and falling in love with the wrong person , and that there is a song in everyone's heart for every occasion . what hinders this production is that the stars are not portraying particularly engaging characters , the songs are not memorable and stand little chance of being recognized by an american audience ( the exceptions might be the edith piaf and maurice chevalier numbers ) , and the farce seems more banal than daring . yet it is not without its striking moments and charms , such as when jane birkin does a cameo and sings one of her own songs . also , the glossy amberlike photography added a very french romantic feeling to the story , while the mood of paris as being a place for love to flourish above all else , which has always been embellished in movie lore , comes through with flying colors . it also does a good job of showing you the way paris is in the 1990s and in the way ordinary people exist there . screenwriters and actors jean-pierre bacri and agnes jaoui wrote themselves the best parts . there's not a lot of bite to this satirical musical , but resnais has never made a bad film and is one of the best current french directors , if not the best . this film is not one his great ones , but it still has enough pep in its light touches to be interesting . it not only has an odd way for the characters to break into song but -- some males even sing in a female voice while some females sing in a male voice . it is also interesting in the way it examines its characters' behavior as being similar in business as in love . "
744,"there are 5 short vignettes where the characters seamlessly intermesh . there are many cogent small observations made which relate to seeing one's self and others as they truly are . the film won a prize at cannes last year , but still is not released to theaters in this country . i saw it on its showtime tv debut . garcia keeps these stories provocative and moving at a fast-pace . this is a smart film that gets amazing characterizations from all the actresses , each giving a wonderfully nuanced performance exhibiting inexplicable and heartfelt emotions . "
745,"robert lord won an oscar for best original screenplay . the director , tay garnett , allowed for satire to carry the comedic load and his instincts were correct , as the film worked , easily overcoming the story's melodramatics . it is interesting to note that kay had a speech impediment , not being able to pronounce r's , therefore the script tried to give her as few of those sounds in her dialogue as possible . this is a breezy story ( believe it or not ! ) skippy : "" the fight between you and me when i tell you i can't pay for the drink . "" "
746,"a road film about trying to reach somewhere . this human interest drama is one big metaphor about a strained father and daughter relationship . but she gets a flat tire and there's no spare . it's a film that avoids cliches for its answers , has plenty of energy , and an intelligent script to go along with the brilliant performances by both lena headey and stellan skarsgard . it is unfashionable to have a mind of your own . "" "" aberdeen "" is thematically similar to mike figgis's "" leaving las vegas , "" except there the end of the journey was most important , here it is the journey itself that counts the most . "
747,"yes . a war zone can be fun for restless teens with hot blood and a passion for mischief . this is a hearfelt film about his coming-of-age during that strife . the 36-year-old filmmaker studied at ucla and was the cameraman for quentin tarantino's pulp fiction and reservoir dogs . but , as riad says , this is our home , there is no other place i would feel comfortable fitting in . the film is not plot oriented , it relies on a bunch of episodic incidents to take place before tarek gets it through his clownish skull and smirking face that this city has changed and won't be the same again . we get a feel for what the director lived through as the friendly tarek is shown relating to his neighbors . the director also presents us with a flavor of the slang language used by the locals , with expressions such as : "" you're shish-kabobing me on a small flame ; "" or "" you drive like steve mcqueen ; "" and , about a buxom woman omar says , "" what a piece of lamb ! "" the film was good at given us a realistic look at how one family looked at those troubled times , rather than for having anything political to say . we are not getting a history lesson here , but a grown man's look back at a period of eight years of his youthful life . the film did this in a rather ordinary way , so that there is nothing deeper to dig out of ziad doueiri's story . it seemed to be a story that the director had to tell , and he shared what he saw with an audience that more than likely only followed the long civil war in the news stories and had no idea how it looked first-hand . this was a film that had no pretenses about it ; it just told the story it knew . "
748,"this moody minimalist told piece is seen through the lush eyes of the camera rather than told as a narrative . it is about repressed desires and a love affair that never really happens . they realize they are the victims in this marriage but can't act out their repressed feelings , they are too worried about what others might say and do not want to be thought of like their spouses . they seem satisfied to eat out together , almost touch each other , and to just sit together while talking . it shows how well-thought of they both are in their environments , which means so much to them . the film is a visual fashion show of beauty and taste . every shot is stylishly accomplished in a ritualised way . nat "" king "" cole sings a host of soft ballads that reflect the film's steamy mood , while the couple often get caught walking in a rainstorm , or riding in a cab together , or nearly touching hands , or brushing past each other on the stairs , or expressing through their facial gestures their feelings of love . "" do you have a mistress ? "" nothing that belongs to it exists anymore . "" wong kar-wai ( days of being wild/chungking express/fallen angels ) has created a film about sexual frustration that leaves you hanging on every gesture for a resolution , but this very delicate romance ends without a fulfilling resolution . it is a film that is hard to put out of your mind ; and , a lot of the credit for that should go to the two big stars of hong kong cinema , leung and cheung , who are simply mesmerizing . "
749,"mamet's second effort as a director , after his diabolically successful house of games , is a totally different styled film . it's a mafia black comedy , with undertones of being film noir . the director's witty dialogue and penchant for interesting plot lines are there , but this film is not as sharp-edged as his other work . their gambling venture turns into the weakest part of the film because it is not believable . this is the entertainment highlight of the weekend for them . it also sparks jerry to tell gino not to get too carried away that the girls like them so much , "" they always like you when you're someone else . "" that's pure mamet dialogue . this scene is brilliantly done , a true pleasure to watch as the men through long drawn-out silences converse without saying much that gives them away . the gestures and the timing of the two is masterful , as the two embrace after much vague conversational banter and recognize each other as equals . there were scenes that lacked weight and seemed phony , but these three main characters gave this film a brilliance in character study : ameche by his brilliantly restrained performance , mantegna by his energetic and funny one , and prosky by his perfectly menacing and touching one . it lifted the film into a rich mixture of farce , gang violence , and tenderness . it's a film that comes with a perfect shoeshine and a perfect smile underneath its ludicrous and cynical premise . "
750,"this italian made western , filmed in spain , began the craze of so-called spaghetti westerns . clint eastwood plays 'the man with no name , ' in the first of the three films made with the same theme ( the others were : "" for a few dollars more "" ( 65 ) and "" the good , the bad , and the ugly "" ( 1966 ) ) . the film is a no message one , where violence is glorified by the hero who is as amoral as the villains . this kind of attitude changed the way westerns were made . it's an entertaining film , gore and all , its only drawbacks being the poor dubbing job and that leone hasn't perfected all his moves yet in a smooth way . yet this film , not as rewarding as his others , still has the style of the director's later works , plus the same themes of graphic violence , a laconic hero , and the thrill of gunfights galore . an old bell-ringer tells the newcomer that in this town folks get to be either rich or dead . clint chomps at the end of his cigar without smoking it , says little , wears a mexican poncho , and is always with his trusted . 45s . but this scene was shot in a shoddy way , as it was hard to comprehend that the two gangs were so stupid that they would so easily believe that the stiffs they were fighting over were real . in this western parody , there's some humor behind all the choreographed violence and there's also a passable ennio morricone's score to instill a sense of melodrama . what makes this mythical film noteworthy , is that it serves an historical purpose as the start of a new trend in making westerns . "
751,"it's become a cult-status film , that has staying power as a rather lyrical horror classic . this last incident is the violent note on how the film abruptly ends . the film plays as an allegory , and has a certain strength in its story telling . by the film's end , there's not much difference between the two families as the fight for survival brings everyone down to the level of a beast . i guess that's the point of the film . "
752,"there's a quiet brilliance about this melancholy chamber piece , that is much enhanced by the artistic cinematography of nino gaetano martinetti . it's a film for those who appreciate oddities in filmmaking and are not deterred by the slightness of the story or the slow way it gets to where it's going . "
753,"howard hughes originally entitled it "" the man he found , "" but on second thought felt the red-menace presented a film with a more modern impact for audiences . despite being shot again , the film still cost the studio only $376 , 000 . warning : spoiler in the next paragraph . for a propaganda film , this one is not bad . it's far superior to other such films on this topic made during the 1950s ( such as the red menace ) . of course , the story of a commie town made up of ex-nazis prospering in the middle of america is hard to swallow , but as sheer entertainment value this one somehow works . it's directed by the very capable auteur , william cameron menzies , the noted art director whose talents greatly enhanced films such as gwtw . "
754,"a solid psychological suspense yarn that plays like a modern noir , but one that comes to a screeching dead-end after its subject matter becomes exhausted and it decides to solve its moral dilemma with bullets instead of with the mind . it's a smart film with weighty dialogue to bring the story to the height of its dilemma in such a crisp way . what keeps the film compelling is the shaded introspective performance by macy who ably anchors the film , as he allows us to see who and what he is ; and , more importantly what suffering he is now going through . sutherland's performance is devilishly demonic , and in his understated call for violence gives voice to a very scary character who gets under our skin . bain's complicity with sutherland adds to the psychological trauma of the macy character . in contrast to the men , neve campbell's performance is loud and reaching . as a character-driven film , it is handled with a quiet reassurance by first-time director but experienced screenwriter henry bromell . panic plays like an episode for homicide does that has become more invigorated with psychological possibilities . bromell , the homicide cop-show writer , has made a tv cop drama come to life as a b movie that can't get away from tv's weakness of hanging a moral ending onto its dramatics . but , nevertheles , i still found it to be a hit man movie with a heart and a brain , a film that keeps a low profile while taking you on a mind trip laced with bitter irony . "
755,"german-born director dominik moll's second feature , a comic thriller in french , is more like a chabrol than a hitchcock film , though a comparison to hitch's "" strangers on a train "" is a reasonable one . its theme could be that a comfortable , air-conditioned car , can help solve a lot of domestic problems . this is something that michel doesn't want but harry , who drives a new mercedes , is someone who believes every problem could be solved . even though the boyish looking harry is an affable guy and plum gets along great with the kids , the couple feel uncomfortable with harry . the film's virtues are : the great acting job by lopez , it is accomplished by slowly allowing us to see how really deranged his character is ; the twists in the story that make it hard to guess what comes next , which gives us a bit of a shock at what is taking place as the story carefully builds toward its ironic ending ; plus , there's the attempt to explain why harry's so obsessed with michel , which gives us an intellectual reason to enjoy the film . the film is done with wit and a sense of justifiable psychological chills . it is a frightening tale , but it is done in such a humorous manner that you might not realize how twisted it is until you start making a body count . it's most glaring fault is that it just seems to be too clever for its own good , as we never learn just what harry's motivations are . sometimes a reader reads more into a poem than what was really there ! "
756,"german-born director michael haneke ( "" funny games "" / "" 71 fragments of a chronology of chance "" ) continues to make fascinating and diverse films about morality . code unknown is a film marked by its documentary style of filmmaking , as it attempts to look in a realistic way at the immigration of people from all over the world to paris . by using shots with long-takes , the director is able to capture in the facial expressions the various moods that strike his subjects . there's an inherent violence in western europe and there's a mixture of races that can easily be seen in the street scenes , the filmmaker tries to see how a modern european city in the midst of such population changes for its white country handles itself . in this episodic film there are several unconnected stories that seem to be leading nowhere , but are followed through at various points of the film ; the film is devoid of plot and relies on the viewer to make their own observations from what unfolds . this is a brilliantly done art film , offering a detached view of immigration according to the way an outsider sees it . it doesn't come to any grand conclusions , at least none that we haven't seen before , but its way of telling its story holds our interest and should be a rewarding film for those who have an interest in observing things in minute details . it was an excellent idea to have a series of long-takes so we can view the african family in action , the romanian woman dealing with her compatriots back in romania and then desperately sneaking back into paris to try and earn some money , and how the french family is also disengaged by the modern times . there's a sense of loss here , but there's also an excitement about what all this change could stir up . some might see it just as a film -- the way binoche views her actress role in the film within the film , who laughs at it when she sees herself on film . there's a special emotional quality about "" code unknown "" that allows paris to be seen in its lies . the film convincingly shows how hard it is for different cultures to communicate with others , and even though this has been said before the film's method of getting to that conclusion is the thing to look for here . "
757,"an old-fashioned , above-average heist movie . it covers familiar ground yet manages to make its shopworn story to appear fresh , but does not break new ground in the caper genre . this one , besides having a tight script , has three terrific actors who cover three different generations . the director , frank oz ( "" bowfinger "" ) , a onetime muppeteer whose main body of work has been comedy , deserves credit for keeping the action suspenseful and the long scenes without dialogue interesting . there seemed to always be something intriguing going on . most of the thrills come by way of the heist and the mechanics of it , and the possibilty of double-crosses and foul-ups . "" the score "" does what it sets out to do , which makes it a diverting heist flick . it leaves no messages and no unnecessary violence , but it holds one's attention for the two hours it plays and afterwards you will remember this one as a pretty good heist flick that had three notable actors in it who performed the proper nuances called for by the script . the film proves to be a solid effort , but it lacks the imagination and moody darkness of the human spirit to take it to a melville level in noir caper flicks . everyone in on the caper could have been in on a venture capital deal just as easily as on a heist , which makes their characters only superficially appealing . "
758,"warning : spoiler in next paragraph . what ray does very well is make this into a love story , one that is movingly real as it is not corny or filled with clich ? s . the dark , expressionist photography and the love between these two in such dark settings gives this very ordinary story a poetical elegance and makes it a memorable film . "
759,"an invigorating charlie chan escapade and the best one in the series , featuring sidney toler as chan . the film reaches its climax after several plot twists when there's a challenge between rhadini and zodiac , which charlie asks lewis's paper to sponsor . this wasn't a tough one to figure out who did it , but the story was a seamless one . it was a fun film , and one also got a chance to see the san francisco version of the 1939 world's fair . "
760,"a very entertaining charlie chan episode , though the way charlie gets the killer seems far-fetched and the killer's reason had to be explained by charlie because nothing in the film would indicate his reason . this film had a good circus atmosphere , lots of charm to it , and the suspects did a good job of looking guilty . "
761,"the studio heads of 20th century fox were most pleased with the appealing toler , as the film proved to be a box-office success . the film emphasized the goofiness of the characters more than paying attention to the detective story , but the warm feeling the story had was very satisfying . by the end the film successfully combines the zany comic antics with an exciting detective yarn , though purists of this series might not be that appreciative of all the comedy antics biting into the suspense . "
762,"a very good chan film . it has a spooky atmosphere , a lot of plot twists , a fast-pace , and is fun to watch . there are many characters ( though there are too many to develop anything about them ) , many suspects , and there is a daffiness about this episode that is endearing . if you disregard all the holes in the story , then you should find this one to be a refreshing thriller . "
763,"the story unfolds like a routine charlie chan mystery , except the plot is well-executed . a solid action episode , featuring a chase through the paris sewers . "
764,"this is the film noir that made alan ladd a hot star after many years as a struggling actor . it helped that they were both short and photographed well together . the film's terse dialogue , atmospheric dark shots in the freight yards and the snappy presentation of a very slight story when added on to alan ladd's menacing and laconic performance , made this a solid example of what film noir is supposed to be like . it helped establish a number of conventions and character types for this genre . "
765,"it is mixed messages like that from ford that have always made me wary of him , and despite how layered in complexity the plot and character development this western is and how tight frank nugent's rich script is in pointing out traditional army customs for those who gave their lives in defending america's frontiers--it is still a film that loves war and finds killing to be necessary . these social rituals seem to be just as important as learning how to shoot a rifle . the film also has a half-baked romance that was not only dull , but made the film feel longer than it should have . as in all ford westerns , there are his stock characters and scenes devoted to comic humor about the irish being heavy drinkers and gallant fighters . "
766,"the film is crowded with at least thirty characters trying to tell their urban horror story . the film also handles a love story , as this bleak look at inner-city life puts everyone's feet to the hot coals . this ambitious painting of a desperate city and its fragile people , often makes salient points and just as often leaves us overhearing conversations without going further with the story . it varies from being like a soap opera to at times offering some very touching dramatic moments . it's a big , messy , angry film , that is both powerful and sad . and like everything in america , it's ultimately about black and white relationships . the film offers observations and not answers . as for its dramatics , i found the romance between spano and williams to be very believable and moving . also , the relationship between spano and lo bianco seemed to sum up the film . it's difficult to say what sayles thinks , as he seems to want to leave that up to the viewer . "
767,"the film is marvelously acted by anjelica huston , who received an oscar nomination for best actress . it also has a tight script by donald e . westlake . it's a film that doesn't leave you with much to think about afterwards , but while it played its grit and pulp qualities shine in the darkness . the film could have been better served with a more spirited actress than bening , who's best asset is her body . while cusack seemed to not fit what a noir character should be like , as he seemed to be more like a guy who was just trying to be a good grifter . he looked like he would have fit more into a sports film than this one . but the film still works as a modern film noir vehicle , as the script didn't have depth but it provided a full blast of cynicism and shocks that played into the dark plot rather well . if it's a dark , sleazy film , that is well-crafted that you are in the mood for , then this one should be right up your alley . "
768,"there is a sense of doom that all the main characters share , as they also share a sense of mixing violence with sex . lewis has created a nasty film noir , where all the characters are sullied by their peculiar sexual habits . conte is convincing as the maniacal hood , while wilde is a good counter-balance to conte . the film was raw , a visually unblemished drama about violence and pain . "
769,"french director eric rohmer's third film is a coming-of-age story , comically looking at the human condition . the beauty in the film is in the natural way the slight story evolves and how tense it gets when love and desire become the main topics that are burning in these very ordinary characters' minds . rohmer is making sport of the adults and how phony they are . the only one who talks with a straight tongue is pauline . the charm in the story is how after all the gossip and lies and perversions pauline sees , she grows up that summer and sees through all the deceits of the adults . rohmer does it without a strong plot but by his ability to have the characters play out who they are in a realistic way , letting their words and actions become examples of how they really are . only pauline comes through this vacation with a worthwhile summer romance . the pleasure in the film is in its simplicity , even if it is not that deep of a story . the natural way it was filmed makes it a pleasant viewing experience , probably reminding the viewer of some similar experience they might have had on the beach .

770,"it's a slow-moving visual piece , setting a bleak moody atmosphere as it touches on voyeurism and misplaced love and obsessions and childhood abuse . the film's title comes from an elvis costello song of the same name . this ill-fated relationship comes to a sudden tragic culmination , which gives power to all the visual images leading up to this surprising climax . he's so obsessed that he can't make love to the more than willing smokey , as he burns inside from anger and alienation and frustration . but the story is too slight to make much inroads into those deep emotional directions , except the power in the film comes from the aftershocks that set in long after viewing the film . it mainly holds one's interest because the story is so oddly told and all the characters seem to have dark sides ready to burst open at any time . when they do , it seems to make sense . its best feature comes by way of polish cinematographer slawomir idziak , who uses his noted method of filtered filming to great advantage here to capture the angst of the characters and their dark love life . "
771,"a very solid crime thriller shot in semi-documentary style . its story is of the formulaic kind , but because it was so smoothly executed and the pace was so fluid the episodic saga had a natural flow to it . under the very able direction of joseph h . lewis , the action scenes are brought about with the tension always building . because of the film's dark mood it sets and that the killers can't be linked with their violent crimes , the film has the feel of noir . "
772,"the story might be slight , but the acting by tritignant is just right and the action scenes keep coming and are perfectly executed . scheider also stands out in a supporting role . this flick is all about shootouts and quirky character portrayals , like the one of the housewife talking nonstop to the press about her ordeal and eating up the fact that she's on tv . "
773,"a more conventional and not as absorbing remake of mystery of the wax museum , 1933 , made with the gimmick of 3-d ( used in a fun way with novelty shots of a barker batting paddleballs in your face and a murderer jumping seemingly out at the audience ) . it also effectively used the special warner color process . strangely enough , the film's director , andr ? de toth , lost the sight of one eye and therefore couldn't appreciate the effects of 3-d since he had no depth perception . this is also the film where vincent price made his mark as a villain figure in horror films and was typecast forever in that role . he wanted to make the museum more commercial by displaying a chamber of horrors , but jarrod is only interested in creating real-life beauty from historical figures such as marie antoinette and joan of arc . it was a decent enough horror film , as seen in this cable tv version of regular 2-d , but it lacked more sparks to it . it seemed to languor at points of its story , and its grand guignol characterization was too often wasted by touristy tours of the museum . they were interesting , but didn't add much to the story . all the creepiness comes from price and igor . "
774,"a tense melodrama about a crippled p . o . w , it was a taut , suspenseful story , ruined somewhat by the cop-out ending . it's still a superior film noir , with a meaningful social conscience theme . the grimness of this tale is certainly something the director understood , and for most of the film that shows . the mood of the film is best captured in the capable hands of bob surtees' eloquent black and white photography . "
775,"a great low-budget heist film noir . perennial losers in filmdom , elisha cook , jr . and stafford repp , fit right in to this plot . it made for a very entertaining film . "
776,"a messenger gives andrews a note marked very important , but when opened it is of trivial concern . it concludes with an action-packed finale , which is not usually the case for the more cerebral way charlie solves his cases . but there's the usual twist in plot to catch you by surprise as to who the gang leader is . it made for a very entertaining film , a solid charlie chan vehicle even though there's less detective work done in this chan episode than in others . "
777,"it was a well-executed , action-packed film noir , co-directed and acted by edmond o'brien . "
778,"an atmospheric , thrilling whodunit , that is full of surprises , is fast-paced , and is well-acted . but the case puzzles him as all the clues so easily point to brent , it's as if the ex-con has been framed . "
779,"this worked , making for a crafty production , mainly because it left much of the horror scenes to the viewer's imagination . hammer studio also exploited the x rating it received , which meant only those over 18 could attend , as it launched a massive ad campaign which brought in the crowds to find out why such a rating and also by making the x part of the film's title--the quatermass xperiment , it kept the public's attention on its ad campaign . yet the monster remains a sympathetic figure . it was an easy film to watch , as it had its creative moments in the dark . it offered better entertainment value than most big-budget sci-fi films . "
780,"this solid western was the only film roy huggins ever directed , as he went on to do tv work creating the maverick series and later on the rockford files . they fear the union's reaction , as they don't expect justice if they surrender . the tense film becomes a character study in bravery , cowardice , innocence , greed , and romance . it was as if a weight were lifted from their shoulders . the film is made potent be scott's austere presence and the dry wit that runs through the script . this results in a very lively film , but also one that is slightly offbeat . "
781,"a top-notch adventure yarn that criss-crosses the globe in the mid-1930s . a solid film that's high on entertainment value , even though it's a conventional work . "
782,"it's not clear which man she's with , but neither shows much interest in her . the marriage has been a strained one , without much affection or love on liz' part for fred . the film has an intangible intensity about it that elevates its melodramatic story and makes all the main characters hopeless victims of their circumstances that they can't change . "
783,"this is her favorite role in her personal favorite movie . he instigated this move she wasn't that crazy about , but went along with it the best way she could . sigourney mentioned that this is an unusual and uplifting film , though the unusual nature of the film is easy to see , as this gritty dramatic film takes a conventional soap opera story about a nuclear family and makes it into a moving drama where the characters are forced to look at themselves again and undergo changes they didn't expect . the uplifting part was harder to see and just might be up to the individual to find what is meant by uplifting . it was a difficult film to come up with easy answers , as it required some thought to sift through the many layers of the characters . there's also the constant noise and lack of privacy to deal with . unfortunately there was one scene that was baked over too fine : that would be the jail scene with alice eventually winning over the hardened cons . it seemed contrived and the film spent too much prison time , as it said everything it had to say about the dehumanizing effect jail has in its opening shot when she was booked and everything else seemed reduntant . also , the last scene felt flat . i find it hard to believe that was an uplifting scene as much as it was one that put an exclamation point on the situation , visually indicating that things are still tenuous for the family and even though they have gone over one terrible hurdle and are perhaps psychologically stronger because of it--they are still not out of the dark . but , then again , if you find that uplifting you'll get no argument from me . the film is directed by scott elliott , making his film debut after being known for his broadway work and as the artistic director of the new group ; the film is more ambiguous than pat , which is not necessarily a bad thing . elliott also does a great job of drawing out an outstanding performance from sigourney weaver . it was a part that should have been expanded and it weakened the film by instead padding it with stale prison and courtroom scenes that many films have done before . nevertheless , this is still a high quality drama , especially recognizing sigourney weaver's tour de force performance of a complex woman who is a little off-kilter . that should be rewarding enough for those who crave intelligent 'mom in trouble' dramas . i unhestatingly recommend the film for the way it intelligently examines the family crisis--though it's not for everyone , as the casual viewer might not be interested in a serious film that can be disturbing when a toddler is taken off a respirator . the film played at the williamstown film festival . "
784,"it's a theme that's been done often , but in this very witty and bitter-sweet comedy the characters are truly endearing and funny . mira sorvino was in the same acting class as laura and read the script . the film was shot on a digital camera . he performs in his underwear and gives a shrill performance that is bound to turn everyone off ; the filmmaker manages to get in a dig at newspaper theater critics and their supposed good taste , by having one of them give it a rave review . what makes the two leads hilarious , is that they are ambitious to the point of being narrow-minded and are humorless about their situation . she was also very funny auditioning for an advil spot which she doesn't get , as behind the humor it shows how being rejected is part of the business but it is very difficult not to take it as something personal . the film does a savage job dissecting the thirst there is for fame , in a storyline that is very much new yorkish in attitude and spirit . it might not be all new material and the characters do grow somewhat weary after a fast start but , all things considered , it was surprisingly a lot of fun . the two are still unemployed and are contemplating any offers for a tv series . "
785,"this was a revolution the director was a supporter of , but has now gotten into trouble with the censors because of his film's contents . the film was unique , honest , raw , and daring . makhmalbaf shows a great passion for dealing with the ironies of modern iran . "
786,"dennis schwartz "" movie reviews and poetry "" whether the story is entirely true or in some parts made up , as the director stated it is , is unimportant ; the film covers the intriguing subject matter of how four single new yorkers exist for a period of nine months , featuring the real lives of two female and two male actors who play themselves , concerned with getting older and still being single . their single scene is provocatively portrayed as being sad and luridly comical . that these four are not particularly people that i can readily sympathize with , does not alter the fact that this is a very human story being told , one that has many implications on our culture , relating how alienated a people so many of us have become in this modern world . the result is an interesting and stylized docudrama , a "" rear window "" for singles . this time it is not a crime that we see , but is a voyeurist's delight , and there is something that seems to excite us when we sneak a look at what someone does in the privacy of their own home , as if we are seeing something about them that we shouldn't see . but it is the four singles who remain the focus of the film , which is really not a documentary , except in its style . this could be a personal ad about her , if it also included that she wants a guy not for sex or love ( she can have sex whenever she wants to ) , but for monetary reasons . michael de stephano is the nicest one of the four , except this little negative fixation he has about homosexuals . he is serious , stable , and straightforward , and sounds a lot like what women want in guy , but he says that is what they say they want , but in reality they are really attracted to the jerks who lie to them and treat them badly , going after them just for the sex . he is obnoxious but not as obnoxious as he makes himself out to be . though it is very hard to feel sympathy for him , especially after he shows us how he will get out of a date with a mutt , which in his lingo , is an ugly dog , by having someone at work beep him so he can make an excuse to leave . this film might be upsetting to some , but it is a fresh look at an old problem , and its aim is readily accomplished , as it offers us an unorthodox study in human behavior under the guise of being a documentary . "
787,"a brilliant , witty mock documentary of jean seberg , that puts words in her mouth that she might have approved of , but did not actually say , these are mark rappaport's words . she was to appear in many films afterward , but her best role might have been in a film few people saw or cared about , lilith . this film challenges our credibility , it offers a fascinating look at the world of make believe and the politics of the times , telling us secrets that may or may not be true . it also enlightens us that seberg's stare into the camera was basically a no-no for an actor to do at that time , but is now acceptable , making her a trend setter . this is a clever film , immensely satisfying and enjoyable ; and , fortunately , the director casts jean in a favorable light , she seems to deserve that . "
788,"happiness is not a film about happiness , because happiness is not real but imagined , therefore no one can stay happy in a world where sadness is the more prevalent emotional state . so goes the theme of this dark comedy , meant to shock and antagonize you into looking at people you cannot readily identify with , in a film that features a pedophile rapist ( dylan ) , a murderer ( camyrn ) , an obscene caller ( hoffman ) , a masturbator ( read ) , a russian immigrant thief ( jared ) , and an assortment of losers and lonely people wrapped up in their egos , as solondz's morbid sense of humor turns to new jersey's suburbs to explore the depravity of the human race . this is an honestly made film that refuses to compromise on its plot or who should be cast in it ( solondz refused the studio's offer to cast the pedophile with a noted star such as , william hurt , because he felt dylan was just right for the role ) . this film is meant for an art house type of audience , one that is able , as difficult as it may be , to see something in themselves in the characters portrayed on screen . i would wonder about anyone who could sit through this film and not be disturbed by it , that would just defeat its purpose . the audience i saw this film with , were mostly williams college students and faculty , and they laughed openly and freely at the parts that had an edge to it , where solondz was going for the laugh because he pushed the button as far as he wanted to go with a certain character and , in order to return to the intensely grim psychological mood of the story , he had to release some humorous energy or have the film drown in its own murky waters . the laughter was appropriate , and even "" hip , "" as it felt right to see this with an audience that still felt the need to be entertained when they go to the movies , and it didn't seem to matter if the laughter came about from the cruel humor it evoked , causing people to react as a group rather than individually . i found that most people in the audience appeared to be nervously silent ; and , there was at no time just one person alone laughing ( but , the best part , is that only one person walked out of the theater and no one hissed ) . happiness is a difficult picture to watch , there are no good guys or gals . the sisters all suffer from ego-centredness , and it takes an audience with a modicum of sympathy for each of them to get past all the vices each of them has , as each one in this story only pretends to be interested in anyone but themselves . this is a very solid film , that is well-acted , that is understandably not for everyone , yet because it takes risks on subjects that are tabu , and even though some of the risks seemed contrived and not a part of the natural story line , this is still a powerful film , one deserving of attention and intelligent critique , one deserving of thanks from those of us who welcome a true effort for the sake of art , even if the art has to sink into the mud to have its story told . many filmmakers have approached the subject of happiness by tacking on a happy ending to their films . that is not the case with this film , obviously . this film leaves you little choice , you can take this film as morbid and amusing as it is , or you can ignore it , or you can find no one in it that you feel some sort of compassion for , and therefore come to hate it . i came close to loving it , while not exactly loving it , mainly because there were too many scenes in it that left me with mixed feelings and messages . but close to loving it , means i liked it a lot for its honesty to subject matter and character . i did , however , think that these characters went too far in their portrayals for me to relate to them without either feeling sorry for them or despising them . dennis schwartz : movie reviews ozus @sover . net "
789,"writer-director/acting star-artist , takashi kitano , has broken ground from traditional films , taking risks that defy explaining how to classify this very violent and tender film , that sways between the two extremes , and as the critic joel hoberman so astutely states , fireworks is a cross between ozu's late spring and don siegel's dirty harry . kitano is not noted for plot development and for understanding women . his forte is in the raw nerve of his films and the stark beauty of the cinematography . one should expect the unexpected from his films . the violence is brutal and fast-paced . the narrative is told in flashbacks , so any part of nishi's life could pop up on the screen , and what would seem like a commonplace crime story unfolding , deceptively turns out to be much more than that , even as nishi gets revenge on the yakuma's who did this to his friend , unafraid of bringing untold graphic violence to the screen . you better believe that caught my attention . but , if that was all this film was about , the dirty harry description of the film would have been completely apropos . this highly original film , that is at times a masterpiece and other times a grade b- movie , is difficult for me to penetrate what it all means as far as a commentary on japanese culture , but the japanese critics have been critical of his attacks on japanese conformity , while the japanese public accepts him as a popular performer and stage comedian , even if his films have not been as well received in japan as they have been in foreign countries . as far as i am concerned , i prefer ozu , i am more taken with his intellect and perspective , but i can appreciate the artistic direction kitano is taking his violent subject matter to , as i found this volatile film to be something special , but something i can't completely comprehend because i don't really know what he is trying to say , as if that really matters . yet his film is a visual treat to behold , and for that i am grateful and accepting of his work . "
790,"this powerhouse of a film is geared to get under your skin and is not , as most hollywood films are , made to amuse you and cater to your idea of what a romantic film is supposed to be . labute's debut film is hard to describe , though the plot is simple enough , but this is not a film that depends on plot for it to be understood . that what comes out of these conversations , to say the least , is disdainful , but that is not the point labute is trying to make , nor does he use these talks solely for shock value . what is taking place is more real than that , and much more frightening . playwright labute uses words that are meant to be spiteful and piercing to one's fragile ego . the scene with the black intern is bound to rub people the wrong way , as it takes us into the strident relationships these business warriors have , and adds the racial issue as another dimension to its political incorrectness stance . but the point of the story is , that their life is absurd , so why not get what you want , no matter what you have to do to get it ) . at least , we have the feeling that aaron understands this . the movie is not driven by plot , so what unfolds is somewhat unconventional for movie lore ( though not for the world of plays , from where the director draws his strength ( ala mamet ) , which has a much richer history of misogynistic characters being the ones you love to hate ) . what is here unpleasant and shameful and immoral , is played out to the hilt with all the traumas one could expect . i must respectfully say , this film has balls . no matter how politically incorrect and unbelievable the story might be , it still attracts our attention and makes us react to it on a visceral level . i think that is because we have all questioned our relationships at one time or another and felt a certain vulnerability , and wonder about how that other person now feels , the one who did harm to us , how is he or she getting on . this film does that to us ; it provokes us to look at things that are unpleasant in our lives . we realize that aaron wins because he is a charmer , but those not taken in by sharing his deceits would not be taken in by his charm . but we are not really comfortable with aaron's aggressiveness , and out first reaction , is to recoil from him in horror when seeing him so depicted on screen . but i wonder how many aaron-types we have met in real-life and didn't recoil from . and his lies , are the kind that those without a true sense of themselves tell ; while , the matts' of this world are the humorless types you might have had a morning coffee with and felt you were with someone you didn't quite like but didn't know why , as they seemed nice enough in the office ambiance , but you know instinctively that you can't trust them , that they will harm you if they can , that they just can't help being the worms they are . stacy is the only one in the film that we are supposed to feel for . the three stars are all excellent in convincing us of who they are in the film . stacy's role might seem to be the most difficult one to pull off , because of her portrayal of deafness and vulnerability , and being "" the female "" in the film . this is not a flawless picture , but it is one that penetrates the masculine soul of the competitive capitalistic system that feeds on aggressiveness and getting results at the cost of coming to grips with one's more tender feminine side . it is able to captivate us , because its words have power . "
791,"the plot develops around how tenuous such office friendships can be , and how death-like is the atmosphere they work in , and how frighteningly transient everything seems to be . that society can be repressive and authoritarian , is still true today , as this film encourages you to see and think about what has really changed after all the women's lib movement agendas and all the other changes in the workplace that have been accomplished , especially for women , and if these changes have really made life better for them . a gem of a small movie . . . adeptly uncovering the need for positive relationships and the need for solidarity in a hostile workplace , which might as well be a metaphor for how to handle yourself in the world . and even though , no smug answers were given as how to accomplish this , one does have choices ; at least , you can start by facing up to yourself and your situation , and not just marking time and staying put on a job that bores you . this movie definitively brought up a topic a lot of people are concerned about , and even if it said it in a low voice , its message can be heard above the idle chatter in the office , if you are tuned in to the right cubicle . "
792,"this is raimi's attempt to go mainstream with an art film thriller that might have an appeal to an audience that likes films that give them some ideas to ponder . this wintry morality tale , its bleak snowbound midwestern atmosphere reminds me a lot of fargo , without the comedy , as it examines the character of three small town locals who have no worldly experience , but have adjusted in one way or another to their lot in life . billy bob is particularly outstanding in his true-to-life characterization of such an individual . but as a result , her interference makes things worse . this is a dilemma for the filmmakers , there seems to be something devoid about this tale that can't surface , except in outwardly visual terms , as we clearly see how morality is drawn in terms of black and white . there is the great shot of the snow in all its whiteness and the black crows surrounding the downed plane , as this sighting of where the money is seems to be a symbol for the film's morality play . the result of all the trio's bungling , is that things are no longer simple for them , as greed and their extended version of the american dream , but this time earned the too easy way , via a suitcase full of money found in the snow , becomes too much for them to handle with any sensibility , as all their character flaws become magnified , and they begin to get careless and talk too much of what they found . this is a strong gut-wrenching suspense film , one of the top ten of 1998 . but the film is just lacking something , and i think that thing it needed , was a breath of vagueness about what is morally right or wrong in order for the story to remain on an even psychological/spiritual keel and not descend into a literal biblical morality theme . raimi did a superb visual job , carefully weaving a noir tale without any heroes or apparent villains , a difficult task to do , but one that he succeeds in without question . my feeling is , that in due time , we will look back at this film and wonder how it was overlooked by so many , as it will become recognized as one of the great suspense classics . "
793,"an autobiographical film of hou hsiao hsien , grounded in the history of taiwan from 1947 through the 1950s and the early 1960s . this was a very demanding and taxing film for me to follow , not because of its slow pace and lack of action scenes , but because i didn't have a full knowledge of what taiwan was historically undergoing during that time frame , therefore the many innuendoes and references to past events , didn't always connect with me , as well as it should have . i could only watch the film from the point of view of what i got from the film itself . and , that is , the story of a family , trying to cope with their own secrets and their own idiosyncrasies , that proves to be a very human tale , something along the lines of an ozu film . but he is also shown acting like a typical child playing games and running around with the other children , enjoying a rich childhood , growing up with many pleasant memories . the film is shot through the point of view of ah-ha . what is beautiful about the film is its lushness , the sunny colors it evokes , giving it a strange sense of touching down on a paradise , and the small matters that are very human that it pays very close attention to , like the softness of the rain falling , his father sitting so nobly by his desk , grandmother acting so eccentric and being loved by the family for what she is . this is a very subtle and wonderfully crafted film that depicts childhood in a very simple but relevant manner , that only a very few filmmakers have been able to do in such a sentimental but unsentimental way . this is a work of considerable merit . review on 2/2/99 "
794,"given the context of the material for this pulp thriller , it is surprising that this english speaking chabrol film , set in st . tropez , is as diverting and suspenseful as it is . credit must be given to an ingenious script , and acting kudos , especially for romy , jean , fran ? ois , and pierre , for making it possible for us to be fascinated with all the twists in the ever changing plot . chabrol will go on to explore many of the themes he has used before , to belittle the bourgeois lifestyle , to question why sex is the most important thing in a relationship , and how money is such a psychological part of one's mindset . mr . l ? gal is a pip , a pleasure to see on screen ; a character nonpareil , played to perfection , someone who , despite his small part , you will remember long after seeing the film . but if you think you got where the story is going now , you better get ready for a few more curve balls thrown your way , because chabrol is going to town with this thriller , twisting and turning at the movement of every julie sexy wiggle . the outcome is a satisfying one , though if you start to think of what occurred , of relationships changing every reel , of those dead , not being dead , you might have some doubts about the possibilities of pulling off all the switches . but by having the police using their power of deduction to amusingly follow the trail as closely and as delightfully as they can , it all adds punch to the pulp story , so even if you are aware that there are a few turn of events that might stretch the imagination a little too much , that maybe the story did get a little too cute , as there are too many places where you can cast doubt that the story would hold up to further scrutiny ; nevertheless , it is more fun to let the story pass as it is , and enjoy it for what it is , as jeff turns up alive , and the situation must get resolved again , as julie is now in a position to choose between the new louis , now able to service her properly , and the dashingly irresistible jeff . what an enjoyable film this is ! so much is thrown into the mix , if you don't like one twist in the story there is another to soon come , as the cold-hearted bitchy sexpot julie becomes more important to the men than the money or their state of well-being . chabrol even gives the justice system a well-deserved scolding , saying the reason for the vagaries in justice existing as it does for women , is because the law was created by men for men . the film begins in irony and ends in irony , even though everything about the characters involved has changed . even the police seem a little smarter for their effort . "
795,"kitano , the director and star of this gangster actioner , has created a visually stunning , original and spellbinding depiction of stylized gang fights , ambushes , and assorted mayhem . kitano the actor , keeps an impassive facial expression throughout the movie , as he toys with his guns at play and for real , in a performance that wavers between a sensibility and an insensibility toward life , as violence though not glorified , nevertheless is what is fascinatingly portrayed by his unwillingness , in the end , to be perceived any other way . the great images on screen is the star of this film , not the acting , nor the story line , both pale next to the splendid visualizations kitano creates . the japanese audiences rebuked him for his critique of their social conformity ; and , thusly , his movie appeal is mostly with foreign audiences . here the film gets playful and unpredictable , as kitano has his men shed their tough guy personas and play like the children they really are . the narrative fades in importance , and the sheer poetry of the moment is caught on screen , giving us the impression that this is the first time in a long while he is enjoying being who he is . you can blindly fall in love with a film like this for its originality and forcefulness , as it allows you to look at brutality without having to offer the usual rational responses for its place in the film . the last reel of the film is somewhat of a meditation on death and suicide . it brings up all kinds of hidden emotions in kitano , and is miles apart from any other type of film of this particular genre . by taking the time needed to explore the inner workings of his character , kitano has taken the gangster role and made it more intellectually spicy than it usually is for such violent films . and , even though , there is shown a lot of the usual reactions gangsters have when they are double-crossed , such as revenge , the film somehow is trying to say more than that , but what that is , is hard to say , because it is the visual effects that are what splendidly override everything else about this film , as there are moments of gore interrupted by welcomed moments of dreamlike serenity , all done with magical camera work , probably , hiding the fact , that the film had nothing really to say other than the pretty picture it paints on screen , since whenever it had a chance to say something , kitano was mute . but it was done so stylishly well , that it was , indeed , intriguing to behold , leaving the viewer with much doubt about who kitano really is supposed to be , aside from his hubris as a gangster , and , his mixed outbursts of violent outward behavior and contemplative inner mood swings . "
796,"this film will evoke memories of films such as chinatown and the bad and the beautiful , and of the starlets of that era , lana turner , veronica lake , and rita hayworth . the feel of the movie is of nostalgia for the hollywood glamorous life of that period , at least it presents what we are led to believe is glamorous , while the paparazzi click their cameras at the action and work hand-in-hand with the cops , hoping to catch a hollywood figure with narcotics , or in bed with someone who they shouldn't be with , or get the goods on some commies in hollywood . there are so many wonderful performances , that it is difficult to say which one is the best , but the russell crowe , dumb tough guy , muscle man cop , takes the cake as far as i am concerned , it gives the film the raw energy and view point it wants to get across , as he believes whole heartedly in what he is doing , as he beats confessions out of those accused of crimes and works over others to get information . and believe it or not , these are the two most virtuous ones in this flick . cromwell is deceptively engaging as the police chief , with a heavy irish accent and with the demeanor of a politically connected cop , who could look you straight in the eye and make you feel as if you were talking to someone who has the goods on you . his role in the film is crucial for our understanding of the underlying sentiment of how the l . a . police force has relished its role as savior for the citizenry , even if it has to defy what the book says is the right way to conduct a criminal investigation . the film is long , but it moves at a very brisk pace , covering a multitude of sub-plots . the most disturbing thing about the movie , might not be that disturbing if you believe that justice doesn't work , anyway , and that if the criminal element gets pounded on , then , so what , they are only criminals who would be getting away with crime completely if not for these rogue cops . maybe the filmmakers are right in their slick attitude , or maybe this film is just pure entertainment . but the film loaded the deck for any other argument , and that is what deters me from going overboard and praising this film to the heavens , even if it is an exceptionally well-made , cynically humorous , and terrifically acted picture ; but , yet , it might not be as great as it appears , since its subliminal message is that you can't change the system .

797,"but for most of the film , it is through wade's narrow focus that we see what is taking place . this is another russell banks novel based film that has been well-suited for the big screen ( a recent one was the more personally meditative , the sweet hereafter ) . because we see the accident through wade's neurotic eyes we are never quite sure what it is we have seen , but by the time the movie winds down and wade unravels , we see how pervasive corruption is in this economically depressed town , and we hope that wade can move in that direction to get the guilty culprits instead of chasing something he might have imagined . but since this story is mostly a psychological thriller , we are caught in the web of nolte's very compelling characterization , as he is someone who puts us into his shoes , so that we can't help seeing what a tormented person he is , and are really unsure for the time being whether a crime was committed or not , until by the film's end , then everything seems to come into place , and we realize how far gone wade has become . nolte is so good in this role , that we can actually feel wade's traumas reverberating within us . his iconoclastic and memorable portrayal of an abusive father , is very hard- hitting and original . these characterizations made the bleakness of the story delightfully credible and penetrating . living in a small new england town myself , i can attest to how uncannily realistic the town and the people in it appeared to be . schrader ( the director of taxi driver ) is so uniquely suited to do this type of film , as he makes the most of this absorbing look into these troubled men' psyches , holding up a mirror of truth , to see if it is still possible for those who are so troubled to see themselves in someone else and to astutely ascertain what it is they are doing to themselves . creating a portrait of how a dysfunctional family is , without being trite about it , is not that easy to accomplish , especially since this kind of subject matter is old news by now . but this film accomplished that by creating an edgy mood piece , that has to be watched carefully , because it is filled with plenty of jewels for those who are willing to dig them out in the dark spaces they are to be found in , where one man's plight becomes something that can be so universally felt . "
798,"so what if the great danish director , carl theodor dreyer's screenplay , written with preben thomsen in the mid-60s , is not adhered to , so be it ! right ! i'm talking about him saying that he communed with the spirits of dreyer and those spirits approved of what he is doing to change the film . i just can't get caught up in that nonsense , for me , it's what i see on screen that counts . it does not matter how others filmed it or would have filmed it , whether it is pasolini's most interesting 1969 version of it , starring maria callas or von trier's take on it , that is the better one . and even though both pasolini and von trier are gifted filmmakers , with pasolini , in my opinion , being the more poetical and imaginative of the two , nevertheless , dreyer is still the master , and i would have expected more from him than i do from the others , though i am pleased to say , i am sated by both these differing versions of medea , but in differing ways . vision and intensity are certainly important elements in a film , and that is what is the driving force behind this film , based on euripides' tragedy , that was made for danish tv . this tale of medea is still a living myth , one that every generation should come to its own terms with , and that is precisely what trier has attempted to do . knowing the story doesn't necessarily preclude that we can feel the story . whatever opinion you might have about von trier's telling of the myth , you can agree that his version of it , is definetly a deeply felt emotional experience , one that went to the heart of the matter in terms of feeling the agony of what a woman who has lost touch with herself because of her pride , is going through . by emphasizing her feelings as being only for herself , her irrationality is made rational , even if it isn't rational . through her fall from grace , we see the tragedy unfold , and the deadly consequences of her jealousy and sense of being wronged come around to its bitter fruition . the dialogue is sparse . the open air scenery is intense , it appeared to me as if i was looking at van gogh's wheatfields , with the wind swirling forcefully in and out of the fields . and this tale is all the more a tragedy . . . the only difference is that from dreyer's style of simplicity in filmmaking , we can feel the pains ourself , we didn't need it enlarged and magnified by wasted and unnecessary movements . that he succeeds in this film , is certainly evident . he succeeds because he has found the right medea for the part , and has caught enough of the mood without ruining it as he almost does , by going overboard with his excesses . i am mainly referring to the hanging scenes of the children . he came very close to turning me off , as i was beginning to suspect that these scenes didn't have to be that explicit in all its morbid details , the idea of having the older child go back for the younger one , seemed to me , to be exploitive and incredulous , as well as unnecessary . all we had to see was the pained expression on medea and the children and we could have drawn our own visions , even more powerful ones than the ones we materially witnessed . the reason dreyer is a master and one of the greatest directors ever , is because he did not compromise his integrity or the film's integrity going after anything that was superfluous to the telling of the story . i always get the feeling when i am seeing a dreyer film , i am seeing something that is truly visionary . yet when i see a von trier film , i can't say the same , even though he is a very talented director , i just can't trust his judgment when it comes to telling the story without it seeming to be pretentious . i am never sure if he really got it or if he is putting me on . "
799,"whale , always the aesthete and snob , comments to an interviewer that he just directed the first two frankensteins , the others were done by hacks . what highlights this film and makes it propelled on a high octane level , is the bravura physical performance of ian mckellen , whose presence on screen is gigantic as a swish personality , much like a few other great performances accomplished recently about gifted artistic and intellectual english queers , such as derek jacobi as francis bacon in love is the devil and john hurt's performance of a fictionalized stuffy professor in love and death on long island . she is wonderfully dour in her supporting role . if it is fear or disgust of homosexuals that repels you , this film will displease you , even though its overt physical sex is minimalized , yet every nuance of the film and all its projections are about what a queer is like . this scene turns out to be a classically hilarious comedy routine , probably capturing whale's devilish personality as well or better than the more dramatic scenes did . clayton is anything but literary , never even having heard of whale before , just as whale is hardly your prototypical fatherly figure . but whale opens up with clayton and becomes nostalgic about his life and his films , more so than with the film student who really knew his films , but was just perceived by whale as a user of people . it seems that there was probably some deeply repressed psychological need in whale to be accepted by certain types of people , which is why he devotes so much time to the uninspiring clayton , it was as if he needed to have his approval to be gay . what is most impressive and understated about the film , is the comic tone and lightness of whale , much like the tone whale used in his horror films , which he used to hide the real fear of death people have and their antagonism for monsters , whom whale simply adored and would never make fun of . he comes across as debonair at all times , even when in the middle of a mild stroke , and terribly witty in the ways of hollywood's gays . reactions to whale , as to whether you care for him or not , come about from how the participants in his life view his films , which we see them watch on tv . clayton must somehow see something in them that affects him greatly , since he alone of the housekeeper and his ex-girlfriend , see's something endearing in those films , yet he is turned off by whale's homosexuality , but he still poses for him , and that only seems to be because he wants something more than the money he is being paid to pose , he wants something from him that he is not quite sure that he can articulate . perhaps , both are drawn to each other because they don't travel in the same circles and can relax with each other since no false representations of themselves are really needed . for all its wonderful performances and charm and probative look into the gay hollywood world , this is not a very important film , in the sense that it has little to say about the creative experience but a lot to say about how a queer man can manuever his way around the hollywood of the past , as long as he didn't make a big show out of his sexual predilections . condon has very ably directed a likable and witty film on a very low budget , that makes its subject seem much greater than it is , it is as if jimmy whale invited us over for some iced tea and cucumber sandwiches and he told us a few things about himself and the filming of his frankenstein movie before he got tired-and-all , so all we had left to ponder was the materialism and memories he was surrounded by , and how tired and painful life has become for him , as he wishes for a mercy killing at the hands of clayton , but since he couldn't bring that about , he instead jumps into his pool of seduction and drowns himself . it is apparent that whale has this tremendous identification with outcasts ( monsters ) , therefore it seems logical to deduce , that for those who liked this film , it really came down to what they saw in it how well they responded to it , just as when clayton saw the frankenstein movie on tv for the first time with betty , and gravitated toward the film , while betty saw it as passe , something that wasn't cool enough for her to enjoy . "
800,"i dunno , maybe his head came loose . is there a connection between the flayer and the birds ? this is real funny stuff . the special effects for this low-budget film are surprising well-done . i loved the explanation given for what god is : an invisible force we fear , and in our vanity , we try to make it human . sometimes the low-budget nonsense films that don't take themselves that serious and just go out there and do their funny thing , are much better than those serious films that win all those critical praises from the illustrious establishment critics , and this is one of those films , in the genre of someone like an edgar ulmer . all you have to remember about this film , is that what you have seen , is all that there is to see , there are no hidden messages or deep symbolic meanings for you to ponder . "
801,"this one has a reflective mood and a quiet sparseness to it , that gives its lonely characters a chance to either grow as the story develops or for them to become clearer about who they are and what they are doing . las vegas can arguably be , america's alter-ego , even if , that city is a sharp contrast to what the rest of the country is like . but it does offer a lure for foreign and american visitors to see how the free wheeling , capitalist country , they imagine america to be , operates , when it lets its puritanical hair down . how to do it smartly , with class . while , melville's film , retains an almost unbelievable lightness to it . it gives me great delight to see the casino get ripped off , as john works his $150 into $2 , 000 worth of credit and a free room and amenities . i wonder if this scam really works ! ! ! the acting is more than credible , it is superb , as it is just right for the atmosphere it sets . the sparse dialogue helps give the story an intensity that is riveting , giving off the impression that there is something deeper happening than there is . the characters make this film happen . it is a good first effort by the director , who has told a tight story and told it well , holding our interest with a fresh approach to an old story . "
802,"the film does a marvelous job of giving us a feel about life in the early part of the 20th century and how resolute some genuine seekers of the truth were in carrying on the arguments of religious orthodoxy versus scientific reality . since he can't find anything phony about these photos , he is pressed into believing that maybe it is possible to prove that there is a spiritual world with such creatures in attendance . his tendency is to believe that faith is what we must live by : "" i don't need proof , faith is enough for me . "" one of the problems with the film , that took away some of its luster , was that charles acted in such a one dimensional manner , jumping from non-believer to a firm believer in fairies in such a rapid time , that it was hard to fathom what was going on in his head . therefore his story did not have the impact it could have had with a more drawn out response and introspective performance . he was not someone that we could warm up to in an instant without knowing more about him than his tragic loss . now kingsley's role is really structured to fit a rigid character who can't change , yet his presence on screen is dynamic , bringing much more to his villainous role than just that one dimension to it . we might not like him but we have a better understanding of him than we do of charles . wanted to like charles much more than we were given a chance to and we couldn't , mainly because we could never get close enough to him . but that is not to say his performance wasn't good . it was well-suited according to character , but it was not a stirring performance and not one that completely captured our imagination . what results is a film that is beautifully photographed and stimulating to the intellect and freshly innovative . and , for how many films can you say all that is true ? we are led to believe that religion doesn't work because it is too fearful to go inward ; that theosophy doesn't work because it is not a real experience for those partaking in their seances and pseudo-scientific experiments ; and , that science doesn't work because its knowledge is limited . but the love story remains secondary to the ideas presented about the afterworld ; her romantic interest in him just never becomes vital to the story . where the story is strongest and most convincing , is when it tries to debunk both the belief and disbelief in fairies . there is no rational argument he can present to edify what he knows for certain . this is a very intelligent and effective film , that raises many interesting ideas and questions about the supernatural . it is a serious film , that should be seen by an audience that is not afraid of a story with an unhappy ending ; it offers a fresh outlook to a meaningful experience about the afterworld . this topic has been virtually taboo in our culture ever since the '60s drug revolution imploded on the landscape and caused a generational war . but it is now the end of the century , and the questions alluding to a spiritual world and the use of psychedelics as one way to get there , are more relevant than ever . if there are quibbles with this imperfect film , they are not that significant when you consider how well it made its case about an afterworld . this is something western mystics might find easier to believe than others ; but , in any case , one seeking the truth still must choose which spiritual conditions to aspire to , and this film presents one such option . that this mysterious story was so captivating , showing how necessary it was for charles to find his place there and how believable his quest was , speaks highly of how well this film was crafted by the director . "
803,"homegrown is a lovable off-the-wall film that , probably , very few people have seen or even heard about . that might be because the film goes off on so many different directions-- from murder to counter-culture romance-- before it zeroes into the hippy drug dealing scene as it evolved from the '60s to what it is today , which makes it a too controversial topic for sony to know how to advertise and release to theaters . this is a film that you will probably only get a chance to see on cable or video . its highly animated story is both funny and suspenseful , with a good deal of its plot made up of the kind of material reserved for a sociologist who is writing a treatise on why certain types of people must be outlaws ; the director's aim was to make a take-off on the treasure of the sierra madre theme , but this time with a stoned-out foursome lured by the possibility of making 3 million dollars through growing and dealing marijuana . a lot of the big-name stars in the film must have seen the merits of this enterprise , because their cameo appearances and the small amount of money they received for being in the film indicates that this was strictly a labor of love for them . it therefore left a very cloudy message about what is a serious matter concerning the whole drug culture . it was a much clearer film to evaluate , if viewed as an enjoyable dark comedy . but don't be mislead by what i just said . this is a well-written and acted and directed film , that is often disarmingly brilliant , getting right in the face of an outlaw lifestyle that is both dangerous and beautiful . it does this better than any other film i have seen in recent times that attempted to tackle this sort of material . the implied message is : the government's drug policy is just not working . "
804,"what is going on inside her , is seen through the marvelously constructed dream sequences of her in africa- as a griot , an african musical storyteller , chants out an indecipherable medley of very potent songs- that are very emotionally received by her . this is the kind of filmmaking bertolucci does best . there is an element of vague beauty and mystery in these sequences that evoke a sense of wonder . strangely enough , their past seems to be becoming more and more inconsequential . the imponderable emotions of love are caught in the music , the stunning visual spectacle of the film , and in the quietude of their personalities . how this works out , is how hard to say . it wasn't easy for me to be sure if love meant the same thing for both of them . the glib ending didn't help me understand them any better , as it felt like something was missing from their relationship , something that either i didn't catch or something that was just left out of their relationship that shouldn't have been . their acting was first-rate and very unnerving , we could see their thinking and emotional process unfolding on screen ; it is ultimately what makes this film somewhat special . the up and down career of bertolucci , is up again after this less than epic film ( actually made for an hour tv program , but lengthened for the sake of a feature movie ) . it is the kind of small art story that bertolucci seems to excel in more than with some of his more recent commercial ventures ( little buddha , the last emperor ) . that even though this story was an obvious and abbreviated one , it was still a joy to see . what the story means , is not tied in with some of the director's political or psychological ideas of the past . this is more or less a film that lives through its style and grace of letting the two of them tell their story without much help from the script . and it worked out better than these kind of films usually do , mainly because there is a power in bertolucci's direction that maybe someday he can put it all together and live up to the potential that was once expected of him . all his films are worth looking at , and this one more so than what i have seen in a long time from him . it sort of grows on you , and seems more emotionally satisfying the more you think about it . "
805,"it is an elegantly sentimental work touching on the rituals observed on an army post . those were indeed more simplistic times , but not totally out of the realm of how some modern day soldiers may feel . the twists in the story line come from the quirks the characters display not from the story itself , which is rather ordinary : the comraderie between the captain and the very irish top sergeant ( mclaglen ) , who likes a bit of whiskey and adds comic relief to the stodginess of the army routine , fits in with the buddy theme of many ford films . a virtue that is considered essential for any character in a ford movie , that he really cares about . it adds to the feeling that the past cannot be ignored . winton hoch , the cinematographer , won an oscar for the visually memorable mesas and haunting loneliness of the monument valley landscape , which was used as the film's location sites . it provides the film with an epic scale of the country , as there is a melancholy intermingled in those vistas with a sense of reverie for the men who are so far away from civilization , surrounded by the red sand and barren mountain peaks , yet are greater practitioners of civilized etiquettes than even the citizens back east , through their daily obediance to rank and order and their need to socialize by formal dance and their chilvary toward women , which might seem old-fashioned but is pleasantly accomplished here . what pulls the film together and gives it a raw power , is something that can only be ascertained by accepting ford's premise that it is absolutely necessary what the men do and that they are in the right . to scrutinize this film in any other way , is to lose track of what direction the film meant to be going . to add color and more sentimentality to the story , there is the theme song of the yellow ribbon , played countless times , either to the immense pleasure of most viewers or to some , to grate on their nerves . the calvary should follow them to their reservations , but stay out of sight so the indians wouldn't be humiliated by the men watching them . this is ford's look at the west and the cavalry men he adores so much . perhaps the scene that summarizes the film's intentions best , is when wayne is given a solid silver watch by the men for his retirement , and the presenting of the gift and the accepting of it , are met with a few well-chosen words , each weighed heavily with an aura of mutual respect , almost bringing tears to wayne's and the audience's eyes , as he reads the inscription that you know means so much to him . if you can see that as a glorious and magnificent scene , you will have , most likely , fallen in love with this grand and lyrical film . but if you don't , you can still be swept away by the eloquence of the film and its call for some kind of majesty of action one should have , in this beautiful , god created country , that ford believes has room in it for everyone who acts civilly . "
806,"there is something about this chic look at modern english society- one that is filled with wanton sex , drugs , and violence- that is more frightening than all the mayhem , perversities , muggings , and rapes it shows on screen . i think that something has to do with the fear we have of trusting the young people depicted in the film with the future of the country . the film is shot in such pleasingly stylish colors , especially the orange background , whereby the film gets its title from . it is so visually splendid a film , that it is shameful that we are confronted with so much violence , as it seems that even the violence as presented and choreographed is all too entertaining for the grim message it is trying to deliver . one might be beguiled into expecting a musical film to be taking place , if one were not aware that kubrick was the director . sex is the old in-and-out thing ; if they want an auto they just steal it , and for someone they don't like , they just pummel them . there is a strong enough reaction to these things to induce a nausea in him . kubrick's look at society is an unduly pessimistic one . there is something evil in society , but what to do about it , that is the question that remains . at least , for kubrick , we better think about what we are doing to ourselves , before it is too late . the most frightening part of the film , was that all the extremes of violence and cultural debasement , are pretty close to what the norms of society actually are . i was left feeling unsure of how to take the film's message . was there a moral ambiguity exhibited toward the violence ? there just doesn't seem to be much to think about as alternatives to the way the problem youth was handled . the film adaption from anthony burgess' satiric novel , results in a pure kubrick over-indulgent , brilliantly visual and graphic film . the jargonistic language used ( called nadsat- an onomatopoetic combination of english , russian , and slang ) made for a most arresting film , one that can't be put aside without thinking about what kind of impact it makes on how we view such moral and ethical problems . but i just don't think we come away knowing anything more about what to do about these problems than before seeing the film . nevertheless , i did find it to be a visual joyride , something that is terrifyingly pertinent in an eerie sort of way ; a memorable film , one that has become ingrained in our culture and must be looked upon as one of those 'important' films that one should see . i just didn't think it reached the level of some of his other masterpieces ( 2001 , paths of glory , the killing , eyes wide shut , and dr . strangelove ) , that , for me , were on more solid intellectual footing . "
807,"fast-paced action and witty one-liners , allow this hitchcock-like story to be both amusing and thrilling . and the surprise ending is a beaut , which should catch you off-guard , as you will most likely be misled and unable to guess who the murderer is . jolly good fun . a real delightful and snappy film , featuring mystery , humor , snappy dialogue , and a great surprise ending . "
808,"jimi hendrix was too stoned to adequately perform "" foxy lady . "" the obnoxious announcer , rikki farr , goes so far as calling the crowd "" pigs , "" wavering back and forth between conjoling and chiding them , with neither strategy doing anything but creating more bad feelings . the crowd shots showed rampant hashish smoke and psychedelic drugs being ingested , nudity , the potential for a riot , and talk among the concert goers that this was a just a "" money "" thing , as the feelings of idealism or another woodstock , which was only one year earlier , seemed like ancient history . the director of this film had to wait 25 years after the concert to release the movie , as the promoters went belly-up over the concert . what is suprisingly good is the sound of the film and the high quality of the music . this film was no woodstock , but it had a charm of its own , and is certainly worth seeing not only for the music but for the history of the period . the moody blues sang a great rendition of "" white satin . "" "
809,"the noir look of the film is enhanced by it being shot at the actual location of the incident . this taut , well-told story , is suspenseful in the noir tradition of showing dark shadows and setting a dark mood . the acting is superb , screenwriter richard murphy received an academy award nomination , and elia kazan , in his afterthought comments about the film , mentioned that he wished he played up the corruption part of the story in more detail . "
810,"i felt like i was being one-lined to a loving death in this elegant oscar wilde comedy/drama costume play turned movie , and i must confess , i enjoyed every bit of the intelligence and the wit and the frivality of it , as this tremendous ensemble cast fired away with a continuous volley of epigrams . it is a modern play , even though it is one that was written in the last century for an audience that was more or less reflective of the characters portrayed on stage . for the elite audience that attended the play , oscar wilde , after mocking the english nobility would , at least , leave them with a thinly disguised compliment , by telling them no one can be ideal . the film was put to screen by the manipulative wizardry of miramax ( shakespeare in love , the wings of the dove ) , who know from the success of some of their recent films quite well how to popularize an already popular literary work by broadening its emotional appeal . they gave the audiences what they wanted , a film that has a romantic heart in it and is not just hilariously flippant , and they should be commended for improving an imperfect but successful play . it rarely happens when a commercial venture turns out to critically improve a work of so called "" art , "" so when it does happen , it should be shouted from the highest mountain peaks . everything is thoroughly enjoyable and agreeable about this wonderfully delightful work of subtle wit and brilliant dialogue . rupert everett stands out as a sheer delight in a cast that is almost perfect ( julianne moore could have been a tad more sinister ) . everett's role is one that he relishes in , as he says of himself , "" i love talking about nothing , it's the only thing i know anything about . "" minnie driver is simply bubbling over with charm and wit to match his . their flirtations are one of dueling wits , with amusing lunges and enough double-entendres to get through any intellectual armor worn . there are so many witty phrases to revel in , but my favorite one is when lord goring says , "" morality is only for those you don't like . "" writer/director oliver parker ( othello ) has created a lighthearted film for all audiences who love the spoken word as if it were a treasure and who find the intrigues of high society to be invigorating . "
811,"windhorse takes us right into modern tibet and tells how the tibetans survive in a country that is not really theirs anymore . it is a well-done and necessary propaganda film ( though even its propaganda is nuanced and made lyrical to a large extent ) . somehow or other the world has to receive the message from the tibetans , who are undergoing at the hands of their suppressors , the chinese communists , a policy of genocide that will probably continue unchecked unless something is done to stop it . this film is one of the ways of getting out this message . this fictionalized drama has to be told and this serious film ( probably preaching to the choir ) cannot be judged as other films are for its entertainment value . if you are seeing this film to be entertained , you are in the wrong movie house , though the exquisite natural beauty of the country and the entrancing holy city of lhasa- and its potala ( the largest buddhist structure in the world ) - offer quite a lot of sights to behold . the brutality the tibetans are under is clearly shown , as the film will tell its story as humanly as it can , through the eyes of one family , and it will show their hardships and disruptions to be symbolic for the sufferings of all tibetans . he steals the picture with this gut-wrenching performance . this travesty really hits home and shames them into actively supporting the non-violent tibetan cause for freedom . what is simply amazing throughout the story is the gentleness of the tibetans , who exhibit no violent tendencies despite all these incidents , and when you compare them with the barbarian behavior of their chinese rulers , you can easily see that this is a story of good vs . evil . it is easy to see why china doesn't want the truth about its human rights violations known , or about the murders it commits and acts of brutality , and its spy system and systematic control over its subjects , or how it refuses to allow the people to even have pictures of the dalai lama in their homes , arresting those that do . the film opens and ends on a powerful spiritual note , as you would expect from a people who value so highly their traditional knowledge of buddhism . thereby , the film will rest its case that the spirit world will always be there for them . director wagner and screenwriter tsering have pulled off a major accomplishment . that makes this a very special film for me , but it will probably be too one-dimensional a story for those who feel it lacks the impact of dramatics and cannot forgive the film for urgently wishing to send out its message at the expense of being more "" artistic . "" but i left the theater with the impression that i was watching a brave people clinging to the belief that they could find in their hearts all the goodness they need to get over this dark spot in their history . i thought it was a well-meaning film that had its exceptional moments , like fully realizing the relationship of dadon and duan-ping as symbolic of the possible reconciliation of the two countrys . but does the film reach an audience that doesn't know thetibetan situation ? i hope it does reach a wider american audience than what i think it will , because i believe that the cause here is just , the acting is first-class , the film is beautifully crafted , and that all people of good faith must stand together and give hope to each other , in any small or large way that they can . if this fictionalized film wasn't about the real life situation in tibet and had the same mundane story , i could see it being criticized for being melodramatic . but since the politics of the times indicate that this film does make a difference , so much so that the chinese government is doing everything in its power to ban it , i therefore think that speaks volumes for how effective this film is as a political vehicle and how its cinematic importance is enhanced by the unflinching bravery of the tibetan actors and their families still living in tibet , still the subject of untold horrors . "
812,"what works very well for coppola , is the over-all mood he captures of how the inner city kids react to their identity crises . we see how they are turned off by school and how they don't have proper parental guidance ; it is also pointed out that if these kids had the proper role models things might be a lot different for them . "" the motorcycle kid "" is an existential hero , saying very little ; but if you get into his rap , he is more likely to be a hero found in a camus story than in a teen film . that makes his characterization seem controversial and arbitrary here . he has a swagger to him and a way about him that makes him larger than life , even mythic . everything he does ends in violence or in an incomprehensible situation . there was not really anything new revealed about this sort of character that hasn't been seen in other teen films ; but , the film does have the gritty feel of reality to it and intelligence in how the story was presented . i'm on the side of those who liked this emotionally wrought , stylized film , adapted from a novel by s . e . hinton , warts and all . it brought a higher quality to this teen genre film than usually seen in such films , even if , i doubt if it would reach the troubled kids the film was about , who in all probability , would not choose to see such an arresting film . to the film's credit , it was not a glossy look at the kids : it had the good sense to stay true to its theme without just blaming society for the problems presented .

813,"the concept of illumination , whence the title of the film comes from , refers to st . augustine's theory of enlightenment . it is what fills the mind with light ; it is a spiritual happening that is the most powerful thing in the world . the hero is likable , somewhat courageous and scholarly , a person of integrity and loyalty , and is the only hope for poland's future . this is a glum film , but intellectually sound , offering many pleasurable introspective moments , but lacking in real illumination , which prevents it from being a great film . that is certainly an arguable statement , as even the protagonist in the story eventually realizes not everything can be settled by rational arguments .

814,"the persian gulf war of 1991 is put to celluloid and made into this action-packed adventure story and intelligent political satire of the once seemingly popular war , that would supposedly regain the american sense of "" feeling good "" about itself that needed resurrection after the vietnam debacle . this was a war that made americans proud of the technology developed such as , smart bombs , and of how casualty free and quickly the war was won , as it was watched on tv . he has made an unconventional but traditional anti-war hollywood movie , in the likes of films such as , catch-22 and m * a * s * h . this one has a potent bite to it , just like the others , but maybe because it is filmed so soon after the bubble for american success has busted , that it seems to have such a deliciously absurd bite to it . it makes one wonder who the americans really have helped with this war aside from some rich kuwaitis . what the film clearly shows , is that the bulk of the iraqi people , not the inner circle of the dictator , seem to be bearing the brunt of the war's dire consequences . the premise of the film is excellent ; the story succeeds as both an entertaining action film and as a searingly funny black comedy , it is even effective as a valuable history lesson . the actors are brilliantly cast and make up for the lack of depth of their characters by giving engaging performances : george clooney is both heroic and devilish , presenting a commanding stature for his authoritative role . jonze is a real hoot and comes across as the kind of dim soldier whom it is easy to feel sorry for and not get too upset with him over his obvious mental defects . ice cube is solid . what results is a brave film , one that has a surreal and trippy feel to it , with some mortifying comedy dished out and some serious questions being raised about a war that can't come to a proper conclusion anytime too soon , as russell explores a recent part of american history that surprisingly hasn't been touched upon by other films , as of yet . the war is covered with more personal detail than i got from watching it on cnn . i feel that the filmmaker has caught the mood of most of the soldiers , who don't understand the politics of the war and just want to go home in one piece , of the career brass who are in it for promotions , the media reporters who want to not only get the story but be the first one to get it , and the politicians who can find a rational for whatever they do . the film ultimately shows that anything is possible in the amoral climate of a dictatorship and a consumer country out to protect its own interest . the reward for the audience , is seeing an exciting film , with beautiful cinematography , in addition to seeing a film that has a grave purpose to it and is funny in a serious way .

815,"this is a steven spielberg dreamworks project film . her unattentive folks don't even realize what is eating at her , that she wants an unneeded breast enlargement , and that she lacks self-esteem , thinking of herself as being unattractive . ricky and lester will share this same vision of life , as this becomes the film's mantra , reinforced several times throughout the film : that redemption can be gotten through love . this mantra will also be repeated at the end of the film , before the credits are shown . the viewer is told by lester , from the other world : that if you don't share the film's piercing vision of what really matters , someday you will . the lesson to be learnt is , that love is the only thing that can't be completely taken away from people ; it remains behind everything that is . this alan ball script , his debut assignment in films , is bristling with comedy and hard lessons to learn about life for these unfulfilled characters . if normalcy is the thing that the families are striving for , even if that is quickly seen as a sham , then what the director brilliantly does , is shoot down any hope for his characters ever being normal , even those who might think that they are normal . so what are they striving for , if not normalcy ? what results is a darkly satirical story that was equisitively directed . it makes sound points about the fallacy of normalcy and the necessity of nonconformity , and that its barbs about suburbia are on target . but the film succeeds , and in some regards is brilliant , not because some of the flawed characters see the light of day at last and might possibly reform , but because the acting was grand by everyone , and spacey was more than grand , his was a tour-de-force performance . he has the ability to squeeze humor out of a stone and turn frightening at the drop of a dish . he's that good of an actor to carry this film , even as he is supported by a terrific cast , he still stands out as the star . bening is his perfect foil , with a special flare for comedy , but still , through no fault of hers , is a cardboard villain , with no room to grow . mena is in an exploitive role , one that calls for an obligatory porn shot of her breasts ; but she is delicious and appealing , and brings more to the part than can be expected , even crying out for sympathy by the film's end . thora , a 17-year-old veteran actress , even at that tender age , played a twisted and sullen figure , but nevertheless came off as a sympathetic figure , giving a soulful performance , in a role that reminded many people of one that christina ricci would play , but not necessarily play better . cooper did a fine job as a homophobic and a closet homosexual , but his role as a villain was also too one-dimensional to give his character a more introspective edge to it , even if his performance was first-class . so why did i just like the film very much but not love it ? i think it is because , as entertaining as this film was , something just didn't smell right about these roses ; everything discovered seemed to be only something that is surface ; there was no real revolution of character going on . i think there were too many contradictions in the lives of lester , ricky , and jane to believe that they found what they were looking for , even if , the film implies that is just what they did do . the satire also became mean-spirited , at this point , as i took exception to some of the jokes plied from these scenes , as they seemed to be mocking those who take such jobs , by implying those jobs are just for losers . his character was actually the most interesting one in the film , since he saw things the others couldn't see , yet i suspect there is something deeply wrong with a teenager who has to find love by being a voyeur and material success by being a drug dealer , no matter how it is explained away . when you think about what the film had to say and distance yourself from all the fine performances and the splendid cinematography that the 70-ish-year-old master of his craft , conrad l . hall , gave us , who is an expert on lighting techniques , and you step away from the sharp wit found in alan ball's dazzling script-- what you are left wondering about , is how shallow it all is , in a film that has a bite to its satire but not enough of a bite to dig into the characters other than what is seen on the surface . in the end , this is primarily a hollywood type of film and all the hype about how daring and nonconventional this film is , should be dismissed as nothing but hype . yet it is a captivating film , one that had its moments of grandeur , and all-in-all , i really was absorbed in it , and somehow liked the film more than i probably should have .

816,"the tune emanating from the piano is a passionate one , coming forth on a desolate new zealand coastline , far removed from european culture , where a piano is seen as something peculiar to possess in such a backward area of the world . it is used symbolically to represent the works of civilization that can soothe the savage beast , if the beast is lonely and willing to listen to something he usually doesn't listen to . the underlying premise of the film is one of communication or lack of it in a world that can be cold , and of how easy it is to never find love in such a world . her voiceover says , "" this is not the sound of my voice you are hearing ; it is the sound of my mind . "" she these scenes are very powerful and surprisingly enough come across as being sensual , even if , the proposal as put-forth , at first , seemed to be an obvious power-play against a hapless victim . but campion knows how to draw out the passions from these scenes and make this unlikely romance between these opposites bloom . all that he knows , is that he just wants her physically , that he feels her inside his gut ; and , that he turns out to be a more sensitive person than at first thought possible , is precisely what gives impetus to this gothic romance . michael nyman's astonishing score , performed by holly hunter herself , expresses the explosive mood of this extraordinary visionary film . a film whose silence and music speaks for itself as an apt way of communicating . harvey keitel , masking a nyc accent by talking in some kind of maori pigeon tongue , is ably cast as the brooding lover who turns out to have a gentle soul , something this loner must have felt in his heart for a long time but now emerges inside him and gives the film a certain kind of raw power to it . anna paquin , in my opinion , is the best surprise in the film , the one with the most difficult role , and the one with the biggest part in the film . what makes it all the more amazing is that she is a mere child , asked to play a part on equal footing with all the accomplished actors she is surrounded by . her performance is the key one ; it is the one that propels the film to give it its needed air of desperation and to outline the passionate struggle between just surviving and living for love . she is strangely rejuvenated by the naturalism and lack of inhibitions found in this backward place and the passion she feels from baines , as it seeps into her repressed soul and transforms her . the film is brought slowly together by jane campion's masterful direction , whose understanding of the erotic desires of the characters is right on the mark , with the result being an original and haunting film , a story that grew more intensively disturbing for me the longer i thought about it . stuart dryburgh's camera captures the internal mood of the characters , as well as the monotonous beauty and the oppressive reality of the countryside . but the film misses the mark , at times , as the two main characters , stewart and baines , despite their fine performances , are nevertheless too one-dimensional to give the film more of an impact . it seems as if this is ada's story to tell and no one else's . this is a film , nevertheless , that will justifiably garner great interest because of her very trying performance . "
817,"lynn hershman leeson is the director/writer of an intriguing cyber-fantasy film . it is a film that is strong on ideas about artificial life , memory , and immortality ; and , in the innovative technology it uses to convey its virtual reality story by using the latest in cutting edge technology , such as digital software photoshop programs . the film was structured around the idea of a double helix to be visualized in every scene and shot by using a dna image as a model for the actors' placement and camera movement . the actors appeared before nothing but a bluescreen and were photographed with a digital betacam and this was then transferred to computer images depicting the same victorian bed-and-breakfast rooms where ada byron king actually resided , the actors and the authentic rooms were then seen together in the live video . the film is much weaker on its drama than on its technology , as its characters seem to pale a bit besides the computerized images of artificial life that it created . nevertheless , for computer geeks , this is a definite must see ; for others , it should be of considerable interest to the more intellectual-minded who like to see something different for a change in a film , in a film that also has the ability to challenge the usual concepts of what reality is thought to be . as envisioned by ada , this information can lead to composing music and creating a poetic language . one of his pearls of wisdom goes something like this , "" information is like a mist that you have to breathe in . "" the concept offered in this film , of the possibility to retreat to the past for communication with historical figures and to gather information from stored memory , is an alluring idea and is certainly one that gives this intelligently made film a highbrow premise worth savoring . what weakness' there are to the story , come about from its complications in its storytelling and the didactic way it explains so much of its mathematical theory to an audience that needs this vital information made clear in order to help them make sense out of what is taking place-- but this ruins the entertainment value of the film and curtails its natural flow . as a result , that very riveting performance of a first-class actress , one of the very best , the illuminated tilda swinton ( orlando ) , is overshadowed by the film's inability to be more energetically engaging , though some effort was made to bring more life and passion into the story by showing both emmy's and ada's sexual passions unfold . but the story couldn't completely connect with all the characters involved and bring out their side of the story . if the film remained more focused on ada's story and we understood her work a little bit more , and if we saw why babbage got credit for the invention not her , it would have been in all probability an even better film . swinton is that good of a performer to have carried this film further if given more camera time . the film's ingenuous structure and imaginative nature suffered some dents because it misplaced its focus , not staying with the part of the story that was truly unique and inspiring . yet for those on the lookout for a brainy non-hollywood film , one that has an original flare to it , this one should prove to be more than satisfactory . "
818," sleepy hollow  is like many other tim burton and danny elfman collaborations : a visual treat and a stylistic thriller . it may not contain tremendous substance but it is sure a pleasure to look at . i took a brief look at an e-text of the original "" the legend of sleepy hollow "" by washington irving ( as any remaining memory i had of the legend itself came from the disney movie and only featured the headless horseman riding about ) , and i must say i liked what the writers were able to sculpt out of the original story . they had to , because the original might have been a fun read but was no movie material . instead , it is to their credit that we get interesting and * convincing * characters from colonial times who seem to have leapt right out of the real story from irving , when in fact most of them were newly created . now i am not so worried for those who might have their plot spoiled for them because they have read the book . much better than that "" psycho "" remake fiasco , eh ? the town of sleepy hollow is but one out of many of the film's visual triumphs . perpetually shrouded in fog and gloom , the town seems steeped in misery even in daytime . even the haystacks look morose . the film begins with awkward shots and a slackening pace but eventually picks up its rythmn . this gets repetitive and pretty much every time the sun sets we know what is going to happen . we also saw too many heads actually getting chopped off . if we hadn't gotten used it so quickly , perhaps it would have a greater effect on us . that , however , doesn't distract from the horror when it * does * happen . the film is a triumph of black and white and shades of grey ( only to be disrupted by the end by that horrible sunlight ) and mesmerizing visual images and effects . particularly enchanting are ichabod's memory scenes which are beautiful yet horrifying to look at . johnny depp plays a wonderfully amusing ichabod crane ; and while christina ricci was decent in her role , i still maintain that she was miscast because she looks too much like a child . the rest of the characters were just as superbly cast . not only was the film a wonderfully macabre piece , it was a glimpse into states of affairs when an earlier turn of century was about to arrive . it was a treat surveying the costumes , the settings , their "" autopsy bay "" and ichabod's peculiar tools . things that most of us in modern america have forgotten ever existed before . picture an edward gorey cartoon . ever seen one of those ? there's no story to it . it's just death , and even though it is a simple cartoon , it conjures up a sense of dread in you . that is comparable to watching "" sleepy hollow . "" it's a gorgeously illustrated children's book that creeps the heck out of childrens and adults alike . * was that martin landau prancing through cornfields in the beginning of the movie ? kind of reminded me of that other movie he was in last summer , where two main characters also ran through cornfields . * and here we have christopher walken with his 15th reprisal of the role of the freaky villain . * there is a nice variation on an oft-seen movie cliche . tired of seeing action movies where hero and villain are at each other's throats on top of a moving bus/car/train/sailbot/spaceship ? * the beckoning hand was a nice touch . "
819,"this dream-like fantasy film , probably a fairytale story gone amok , filmed in the style of german expressionism ala "" the cabinet of dr . caligari , "" and most reflective of a kafkaesque type of story depicting a man trapped by absurd circumstances and his mistrust of society , as the film sets a nightmarish tone . there are deer antlers that hang on the walls and pine cones and needles on the floors of the classroom . the use of deer must hold some symbolic meaning to the story , but i would only be guessing as to exactly what . the lessons take place in a dilapidated building , with a creepy looking and uninviting interior , setting the claustrophobic atmosphere the film thrives on . he will remain here until the school crumbles , as it seems to be coming to a slow but sure end , as the director announces no more students will be taken in after jakob . what is the reality of life if everything can be turned upside down and what does reality mean , might be some of the things the film is questioning , that is , if one were looking for a theme to this intriguing tale , filmed in a grainy black-and-white monochrome , which added to the film's evocative mood . jakob asks , "" is there anything jesus could do for us in this world ? "" the film succeeds in being a hypnotic work of much visual merit , that is different in scope and in intention than other films , probably defying classification into a type of genre it belongs to . there is hardly any dialogue , and the sparse dialogue that is there , does not seem to be that pertinent to the story , as the actors recite their lines as if they were puppets on a string being manipulated by the quays . but it is the aesthetics that seem to count for what are the dramatics of the film . its story of the high and the low in status , each accepting unconditionally their place in society are examined in a most bizarre fashion in the student's and his master's mannerisms , as all the repressed students who willingly serve at their master's discretion go through their eerie robotic movements , and the story has the look of a spellbinding fairytale . the film runs its course with alternating moods of exhileration and tedium , but proves itself to be visually stimulating overall , with every scene showing the contrasts between the light and dark of life . there was also the memorable weird scene in the beginning of the film , where a face appears distorted through a goldfish bowl . but , this unsettling film is , nevertheless , diverting in a positive intellectual way , even as it is subject to much speculative interpretation . you can look at it as a visionary poem or as an allegory on life , either way , the film is original and stimulating , if one can take the very slow pace of its camera work and its tenor of dull melancholy and its inconclusiveness into proper consideration . the film was stylishly scored by polish composer lech jankowski . "
820,"how can a bad film be good ? well , in the hands of edgar g . ulmer , it is possible to end a film with an overbearing melodramatic paranoia to it , on the edgy words of the protagonist , who wonders to himself how , "" fate could put the finger on you and me for no good reason at all , "" and not be laughed at as pretentious dialogue . instead , this work becomes a memorable cult film that can so easily in lesser hands than the skilled ulmer , have fallen into the realm of inanity , but here becomes a strong film about the meaning of fate . what is most amazing , though , is that this film was shot in six days in a poverty row studio on an extremely low budget , without an attempt to get any location shots for a story that centers around a cross-country hitchhiking trip , and yet it remains gritty and realistic even if the film is full of technical errors . it remains fully a part of the rich history of b&w noir films . it is also an example of what the big studios can't seem to do well , how in their attempt to make a film that is pleasing to a large market share of the audience , they too often lose track of how interesting a story can be without the usual formula applied to it or the need for making it glitzy , and they fail to get into the soul of their stars , where they should have been going in the first place . which might explain how this poorly acted , weakly-crafted story , was so much applauded by film buffs that it has reached classical cult status in film lore and is even revered by certain noted directors such as martin scorsese , and was held-up by the french movie critics as a work of true art when they discovered the neglected film in 1950 . in a voiceover , he asks , "" did you ever want to forget anything and can't because there is always something that comes up to remind you of what you were trying to forget ? "" the most memorable part of the film , the part that seemed the eeriest and most convincing comes next , as al starts to panic and can't think clearly . he goes over in his mind the choices he has , as he keeps saying to himself who would believe me if i told them what happened : 1 ) my first instinct tells me to run . 2 ) the next possibility is to sit tight and wait for the cops . his weak character and not his criminal act of stealing haskell's identity are the cause of his downfall . ulmer has created an unusually bleak character study , that plays like a mesmerizing confession , as the hero has the intangible quality of innocence going for him , which adds a seductive quality to his character for those in the audience , such as me , who can appreciate his natural inclination not to trust the authorities , even when that seems to be the most rational thing to do in the dire predicament he was in . to understand that , is to begin to understand the power of a noir film , probably the most original cinematic work the american film industry has produced . the noir hero is just not like the other hollywood heroes ; he does not see the world in technicolor . "
821,"alvin's eyesight is so poor , that he doesn't have a driver's license , he walks with a cane , has a bad hip , has emphysema , and is as stubborn as a mule ; therefore , even though , it doesn't make too much sense to travel the way he does , no one can talk him out of it . the film reeks of midwestern wholesomeness , folksiness , and homespun philosophies . that it works so well , is a testament to richard farnsworth's compelling characterization and the flavor the film captures of the genuine straight people playing straight man to alvin straight on the two-lane highway he takes across the mississippi river to wisconsin . it features a road show of ordinary folks , consisting of those who can be kind to a stranger who is doing something he probably ought not be doing . their ordinary lives are put under the microscope in a slow-moving tale that is not in a hurry to get to the end of its journey , as the strangers talk to each other , seriously listen to each other , and we as an audience get to know all of them reasonably well . as a change of pace , american viewers might welcome a pause from all the action films and whacky stories they are inundated with , and take a reality check to see if they are interested in seeing a film that most of them could have been in . times . "" the film plays as if it was a foreign film , since it is rare for an american film to be so self-conscious of itself , so interested in just looking at the open blue sky , the blowing wheatfields , the bare streets of a sleepy town , and having its star find peace with himself without any reason or big event in the film . it is also a film that knows how to keep proper time with its slow-moving story and the slow-moving transport of its hero . by doing this , it suggests that his life can be carefully digested without everything being brought to a conclusion before it needs to be . some of the vignettes worked better than others , but what was always convincing was how the unsophisticated but straight-forward manner of farnsworth , came across in such an appealing way , a way many americans would like to think of themselves as actually being . yet , lynch handled it correctly by just indicating by her changing facial expressions that something was clicking inside her and that she was becoming less confused about what to do , and by having her symbolically show that she understood what alvin told her to do . fortunately , nothing much is made of this event , except alvin has the common sense to have some deer meat for his nightly camp fire . the film moves into territory where people of good nature really communicate with each other and offer whatever support they can to each other , and it is the right support because they have tapped into the source that gives them such character , which is what the kindly relationship that developed between danny and alvin offered . this film was just right for what it wanted to do ; it felt good seeing alvin's journey find closure . the sentimentality of the film was kept to the minimum and lynch did not try to make this small story grander than what it was , and that's a good thing , because the smallness of the story is what made this film seem so elegant and it is also what made it seem epic . but , in a film that goes only surface deep in uncovering the mythos about small-town america and its elderly , it becomes unfortunate that the filmmaker couldn't delve deeper and get more out of the story , as it seems as if this is a story waiting to be pried open even wider by someone who is not stuck on what seems to be the obvious but wants to make some waves with the politics of such small-town conservatism and question why the towns look so dry and shrivelled-up , the people seem so unintellectual , and the places visited so dull , notwithstanding , how kindly its citizens can act in an emergency . after initially being very pleased with the film , i got to wondering what i learned about alvin straight that i didn't know when the film began ; and , though i thought that alvin's reflections about his life were genuine , i still didn't really know what he is all about by the film's end , even if i now knew his darkest secret , and that is what troubles me most about this film . there is something about his life that makes me think of alvin as not only a likable character , which is what i found him to be , but someone who is so set-in-his-ways that he cannot evolve further , and he is someone who is so accepting of the "" american way of life , "" that it seems a shame that he can't find anything to say that questions the america and its institutions he was prepared to give his life for during ww11 . he would be someone who would make a good poster boy for the religious right . there seems to be no rebel in alvin , as lynch seems to accept his status quo without any hesitation . alvin , for all his appeal , just seems to be another blind follower of the so-called american value system . it was difficult for me to see lynch's motivations for making this simple story without offering any ruffles in the feathers of the american eagle . though , he certainly has a right to see things the way he does ; it , nevertheless , is disconcerting to see a film that is so accepting of the institutional american values without even questioning them . but if this is just a mild tale about an old-timer , doing something a little ornery , then it works and is pleasant to look at , just like it is pleasant to have a conversation on main street with some real people . it makes you feel good , but is that challenging enough ? i still don't know what lynch's motivation is for making this walt disney family value production film , except it seems to be an ode to traditional values , which seems odd coming from him , especially since he is known , rightly or wrongly , for making films that are supposed to be on-the-cutting-edge . there was nothing daring about this film , as its appeal is mostly through the magnificent performance of richard farnsworth , who is a movic relic , chiseled in dignity with his weather-beaten face and his geezer-like sensibilities shining through . he is someone beyond acting criticism , and whatever failings or misplaced points there are to his story , the film is still a relatively interesting work , retaining something about the american mythos that is worth investigating further ; this is a film that is well-crafted and well-worth seeing , and this is so because lynch knows how to film a story in a thoroughly professional manner . as for lynch personally , i don't have the foggiest idea what his real beliefs are or what his changing career moves might mean , but as far as this film goes , he seems to be very accepting of the status quo . "
822,"i only know for sure that this is a revenge type of film and that it plays much like many a classical western , but is shot in the '60s style of "" point blank , "" and is scripted by lem dobbs , most probably , for the entertainment value it provides . i also know that a limey is a slang term for a brit and that he is played with a bravura performance by terence stamp . the story frequently goes from what he is thinking to some flashback to some future thing he wants to do , therefore the time sequence is often confusing . if there is supposed to be a deeper meaning than revenge in this very titillating feature , it is hard to say what that deeper meaning is , unless from all the garbled cockney sayings by wilson , this is a film about what the meaning of one's life is , as a senior citizen who had plenty of time by himself to give the question adequate thought , as we see that he from time-to-time reflects on that subject . in any case , this film seems to be all style and that style is wonderful to behold . it is also a film about nostalgia , as it brings back haunting memories of a time that was intermixed with hope and confusion . the '60s are dismissed here , as only being what happened in 1966- and early '67 , and that golden "" hippie "" age is further reduced to a few golden moments of feeling free through the promising new music arriving on the scene . steven sodergergh ( sex , lies , and videotape/kafka/schizopolis/out of sight ) has a way of making quirky films that border on the mundane but offer promises of much more . the director makes frequent flashback cuts to the stamp of younger film days , using the 1967 film he was in , as it becomes more and more evident that this film has many purposes to it , not excluding the former real-life film roles of its present iconic stars and how they are now portrayed onscreen . perhaps , the '60s itself was mostly an innocent call for a better world that was manipulated by those who knew better , like the terry valentine's of the world . therefore style over substance isn't all that bad a message for this intensely shot nouveau-noir work , that seemed to be saying something like that or maybe it's just that the king's english , even when spoken by a common criminal in a rich cockney accent , sounds so worthwhile , that i have been so duly conditioned to believe that about the english language , that i would listen keenly to anyone who spoke like that and believe i was listening to something philosophical . "
823,"he seems to be interested in just surviving , there is no political savvy about him , as he seems unconcerned about the reasons for the korean war and what it means . the picture is graphic and direct . it could be read as an allegory about the war , except fuller keeps it to be a no-nonsense telling of the war , one where man is on his own to make of it whatever he wants , not relying on compassion or sentimentality to survive but his own instincts . the most important thing is to come out of it alive . what they are observing is quite different from what buddha meant by observation . this low-budget film from lippert studios is probably the best film they ever made . this is a beautifully done b&w action film , one of the most powerful war stories ever made . gene evans , in his debut movie role , is nothing short of sensational . the film is taut and grim , and is excellently paced , holding one's interest throughout .

824,"david lynch's nightmare debut film is shot in wonderful b&w ( in the expressionist mode of a german horror film ) . it features a unique soundtrack that is mostly made up of constant shrill sounds that might destroy your inner peace ( clangs , hissings , whistles , street noise , etc . ) , but it also has a lovely little song tract , sung by the deformed lady in the radiator ( laurel near ) , with the catchy lyric , "" everything is fine in heaven , "" as it is meant to offer hope to the despondent hero of this dream , who is probably thinking about suicide as an answer to his problems . the film is a long dream-sequence about an awful urban smoke-infested industrial city and other terrible things . this weird tale is an original , personal , and provoking work , capturing the darker side of modern urban life for the have-nots and the dark side of the dreamworld for the dreamer . the story makes little sense in the real world of things , but has its own logic within the contexts of the film . at least , certain experiences drawn from its little episodes can be related to one's own experiences , as it makes a striking impact on one's fragile modern psyche . this is what a cult film is supposed to be like , and in that sense , there is a certain ready-made audience for this film , who should be accepting of it even if they don't know what the film means in total . and , that's not so bad a thing in the case of this movie . those who like their films with a solid narrative , will not find what they are looking for here . he has a distinct nerdlike look , featuring a bride of frankenstein hairstyle and in his lapel there is a plastic-holder for his pencils and pens . the conversation is so slow in coming forth , that it is painful to listen to . inward tension , results in a dream within a dream , which shows henry's head being lopped off and made into a pencil-eraser , whereby the film gets its title from . he is seen appearing in a rock , slightly above henry's facial features . this is a film not made for strictly entertainment value , and to get the viewer involved in thinking about what all these symbols mean , requires some imagination on their part to interpret the dream . i would hazard a guess and say that the worm has something to do with the deformed baby and the concept of original sin . what it all means , is probably anyone's guess . but it is visual and shocking to the intellect . it is one of the more imaginative efforts put forth in an american film , reminding me most of a bunuel film . that as illogical , tedious , and repulsive as it may be , there is still something there that grabs our attention before we can turn away from it . somehow i get the feeling there are lots of people who can identify with henry , even if they will not admit to being nerds . i just loved the idea of the film , admittedly more than i loved watching the film ( i saw it on video , where the images were sometimes too dark ) . yet i found this imaginative work to be one of the more interesting films to come out of the '70s . "
825,"tod browning's ( dracula/the unholy three ) outstanding film addresses the point about watching a film such as this one , with a long-winded rejoinder ( this "" crawl "" was added to the film after its original release by the producer who bought the film from mgm , dwain esper ) . it is basically an apology to his audience for the freaks used in the film , taking note of the usual revulsion most people have when they view the abnormal , as he points out that the majority of freaks , themselves , are endowed with normal thoughts . looking at those who are pinheads , limbless , dwarves , a bearded lady and her baby bearded girl , twins physically attached to each other by the hip , and the assorted other real freaks used in this film , has its initial shock to those not used to seeing the abnormal , but that should soon wear off and what remains is how sympathetic the audience becomes to the freaks , who are part of a travelling circus sideshow . this apology was not needed . mgm has foolishly edited out 30-minutes of the film , thus reducing this b&w horror film to around 63-minutes . the price paid , is that character development for some of the subplots fails to materialize with any conviction felt . which is a revolting statement about where that country's sense of freedom of speech is at , more than it was a reflection of how gross the picture was . the wedding celebration turns into a macabre scene , that is both vexing and titillating to a certain degree . she is last heard clucking like a chicken . the final scene , which has the look of being tacked on , was indeed tacked on , as the studio insisted on a happy ending . i would have to think because of the way the film was cut , the characters of phroso and his lady friend venus , were never developed and remain dry portrayals . their roles were just not that interesting . that is how the film opened and closed . the obvious themes of the film are that there is strength in numbers , that the beauty of an individual should be judged by their inner character and not by their outward appearance , that we are all human beings and that to mock someone else is like mocking ourselves , and that one shouldn't prejudge individuals in a biased way . if those aims are controversial , then it is no wonder there is still so much irrational hatred in the world . and by the way , browning did not exploit the freaks , as the critics in the 1930s said , he made the normal people who were intolerant to be the grotesque ones . "
826,"possibly the best british noir film ever made , a film adapted from the graham greene novel . the tourist bureau was so afraid that this gloomy look at brighton would scare off tourists , that the film opens with a "" crawl "" telling what a safe and jolly playground community brighton now is . in fact , he is more sympathetic to the killer in the film , no matter that he is a certifiable maniac . while he is too far gone , to do anything about what is right or wrong in the world . ida shoots back that people never change- "" i haven't . "" the last scene in the film is one of those memorable ones that just can't be easily forgotten . it has a raw power in it that a noir film commands when the dark side of human nature unfolds so suddenly onscreen , even if the scene was changed from the one in greene's novel . further saying , "" i got his voice-i got proof of his love . "" we have to hope and pray . when rose puts the record on , we have already heard what pinkie said and wait to see her reaction , but when she plays the record : "" what you want me to say is i love you , "" the record gets stuck and plays that over and over , until the final shot of the film is of the crucifix on the wall , with rose , seemingly , elated to have her love reaffirmed by such a positive proof . this cynical ending is perfect . the filmmakers thought it could be construed as possibly a happy ending for the filmgoers who thrive on a happy ending overcoming the general despair of the film . but the film was a failure at the box office . the only weakness in the film was the awkward pacing of the story and the over inflated role of hermione baddeley . it was a brassy portrayal that detracted from the noir mood of the film . richard attenborough's manic performace as a psychopathic , androgynous character , who had violent mood swings , was pulsatingly brilliant . his sadomasochistic relationship with the naive rose , coupled with dark shots of the seamy side of brighton , plus the expressionistic studio shots , gave the film a raw energy that makes it more powerful than the usual gangster film . if you have any kind of feel for noir films , this one is in the don't miss category . "
827,"this is a wonderfully chaotic work , meriting high praise for what it tried to do and not condemnation for what it failed to do . there's such a thing as something being spoiled because it has too many good things going for it . that is the case with this ensemble dramatic piece , whose most telling fault is that it eventually resembles an overblown soap opera , going on for far too long . its three hours length and many subplots will attest to that , even though it is artfully woven together , but could in all honesty , have enough material for five other movies within it . therefore it is not surprising that the ingenuously talented director , the 29-year-old paul thomas anderson ( boogie nights/hard eight ) , had to finally tie-up all the loose ends of the story into a nice knot , which resulted in an ending that won't please too many because it might seem absurd . but i found myself accepting of its biblical ending and was impressed by the overall stupendous effort of this exuberant film , that is pumped with self-confidence and a virtuoso style . a work that mirrors greatness even if it doesn't quite keep that greatness in proper focus . the film does go on for too long , with the only thing that could save it from never ending is a biblical miracle , but it settles instead for a plague right out of exodus in the bible to make its farewell . that improbable ending was set up and apologized for in its prologue by the offscreen narrator , who explained three different bizarre chance happenings as unlikely but possible , giving cause for the improbable ending the film comes up with , and after all , how absurd could that ending be , if the bible used the same material ! the reward the viewer gets for sitting through the long and highly structured but at times confusing film , that tries to picture life as being a matter of coincidences , is how brilliant the individual skits were and how fine the acting was . even tom cruise , as his estranged son , playing an obnoxious hustling infomercials maker for the product he is selling to men , so that they can conquer women , was done with a blend of humor and pathos , making his role less obnoxious than it could have been . in a role that reminded me , of jean-pierre leaud' outlandish performance in "" irma vep . "" here , cruise goes for the jugular , as a boorish male predator , someone who is just plain unlikable and prone to going off on rants . cruise is becoming a noticeably more polished actor ever since his kubrick stint in "" eyes wide shut , "" and deserves much praise for this role . they are all-tied together too neatly and the outcome of their sufferings is too predictable for my taste . but that can't begin to explain how penetrating a human drama this is and how acutely aware the young director is of the people's misery and heartaches he highlights . he is mostly guilty of being excessive , wanting to put too much of a good thing on the plate , in this robert altman's short cuts-nashville like production . but anderson offers more meat in his character's parts than did altman and more finesse in telling his story , allowing his actors to expand their roles more . the performances by all were superb , but reilly's and hoffman's were better than superb , in a film that didn't have a featured player , but allowed each performer to take his or her time telling their story , as anderson was able to create a somewhat seamless work out of this separate skits , making use of different camera angles , using tv intercutting methods , fast-cut editing , and utilizing a provocative visual style . he also made the story seem fresh and moving in many different directions to catch all the personalities involved in the story . he also made use of a song , through the performance of aimee mann , who somewhere more than half-way through the film , sings the theme song of the film , and it is heard first by one character , then another , until all the film's troubled souls are brought together by a single refrain . "" it's not . . . whatever fault one might find with the film , that fault is countered by how interesting and refreshing the film felt , and with the director's flair for taking risks . the unbelievable tale puts one into the mood of the magic happening onscreen , and the magic was not necessarily in what was extraordinary and not in the cleverly plotted coincidences , but in the telling tragedies of the lost souls and their injured psyches , casualities that are inevitable in america's modern world of consumerism . "
828,"john alton is an excellent cinematographer , with noir films being his specialty , as his camera knows how to capture that shadowy world of half-lit images and dark background scenery . his camera work adds the extra-element of suspense and by using many different and odd camera angles he makes things seem unbalanced , something that works rather well for this nightmarish tale . in this film , the director and the cinematographer are fortunate to have a tight , tough , no-nonsense script to work with and they make the best of it , touching a raw nerve or two , as the film is fast-paced and packed with scenes that are shockingly brutal . this film is one of the best kept noir secrets , as it is not mentioned enough when powerful noir films are discussed by aficionados of the genre . this is usually the man's role in such films . we have witnessed a special poetic moment in noir film , a shot that has since become a classic , telling more in its noir imagery than words could ever express . this was the weakest scene in the movie . it seemed too contrived , as the killer's wild comment to them was , "" i killed her but i don't know why ; i deserve to die . "" but it , somehow , sounds to her , that he is saying it to ann not her . the photography is electric , consisting of low angle shots and reflections of light coming in from the open window , giving the scene a naturally eerie look and a depth perception creating the illusion of how far apart the men have now become in their lives , as the light from the candelabra highlights the shadows in the room . this fatalistic drama ends in total violence , with no winners . it's a sad reminder of burning desires and romantic dreams going up in flames . claire's voiceover narration gives the film some added chills , and the three main characters become studies in emotional deprivation , giving the film an added depth in its character study . the acting was first-rate . the look of the film was beyond reasonable expectations of how good a noir film should look . the sexual tension was penetrating . this was , to say the very least , an interesting work . "
829,"an old-fashioned coming-of-age story with a big heart ; "" the cider house rules "" is a slow-moving tale that builds on its characterizations and never waivers in the warmness of its story , no matter , even if somehow events turn sour . it is the kind of humanistic story hollywood can do very well , when it puts its mind to it , and in this production has done itself proud , making it the kind of film oscar is partial to . the one fly in the ointment , is its pro-choice emphasis , probably too controversial for hollywood to want to deal with , even if the director has gone out of his way to be evenhanded in presenting both sides of the issue in the film and so far no outcries from church groups against the film have materialized . the film took him 13 years in trying to get the project off the ground ; the result is a pleasingly sensitive narrative , avoiding anything too sugary . the only thing homer won't do , is abortions . the main theme of the film is that in your life it's most important "" to be of use . "" the rules that make the most sense , are the one's that are made by the party concerned , not by some outsider . the good doctor would be happy delivering babies and not doing abortions , if he thought that all the babies he delivered would be adopted . the only question he couldn't answer , probably because it is a question that can't be answered , is when homer says , "" what if i were aborted ? that would mean i wouldn't have had a chance to live . "" it reminded me of going to an animal shelter to adopt a dog and watching how they also make friendly gestures at their prospective owners . the point made , is that the children still want to go home to a family , despite this orphanage being such a kindly run place . the second part of the film involves the good-hearted , quiet and sincere homer , seeing life from a point of view away from the orphanage . swedish director lasse hallstr ? m ( my life as a dog/what's eating gilbert grape ? ) has made an articulate film , one that goes over territory such as abortion , incest , murder , and forging records , and asks the viewer to use their intelligence in seeing what is right or wrong . it is , at all times , a visually beautiful film . the children are heart-stoppers , and caine is simply brilliant in drawing them out . there is not one flawed scene in the story , in a story that has a few subplots that run parallel to its main motif . homer's insightful look at the world , is also the viewer's way of seeing things the way a child would , who hungers so much for honest affection and is striving to find his place in the world . the filmmaker has told a positive story , in a straight narrative style . the only failing in the film is that , maybe , the director walked too fine a line in regards to the subplot in the film , about the abortion issue , not making his motives absolutely clear , when it seems obvious where the film's heart lies , anyway . but , maybe the filmmaker wasn't clear enough in where the film's leanings were and answered it like a liberal republican engaged in a presidential primary might be forced to answer the question , in order not to scare the right- wing away from him . as for me , this is a beautiful and delicate film , that all but spells out its leanings for pro-choice being a practical answer to the controversial problem . yet some movie reviewers , including the esteemed roger ebert , the most widely read critic in america , find that the theme of the film is muddled . ebert is not sure what the point of the story is about , as it seems to arrive at no clear point of view , for his tastes . a response like that surprises me , because it is one thing to not like the film , but i can't see not liking it for that reason , since i found the direction the film was heading down to be very clear and i had no trouble with its showing how terrifying an ordeal an abortion could be , as it also showed how necessary it was not to leave an abortion in the the hands of someone with a coat-hanger , that it was a medical problem as much as it was an ethical problem and a decision that only the one with the pregnancy problem could decide whether it was the right or wrong thing to do . i couldn't see how the filmmaker could be clearer about what side of the fence the film was on . the story had a natural rhythm to it , and the relationship between caine and maguire wasn't contrived , but seemed to generate its own energy ; it seemed genuinely affecting . i felt very touched by the film and its ability to tell such a heartbreaking story in such a sensitive and intelligent manner , without it being an art house film . "
830,"the iverson ranch at chatsworth , a movie site rented out to all studios , was dressed up and used for the technicolor production of rko's rancho notorious , giving the film its artificial look . nevertheless , lang's western overcame that obstacle and today is considered as one of the strongest and the most unusual westerns of its kind , a film that could not be dragged down by the bickering between lang and dietrich during the filming , or by the low budget ordered by howard hughes which kept most of the work in the studio , or by hughes' taking lloyd gough's name off the credits because he failed to testify in the huac's hollywood witchhunt . it was the first westerns to make use of a folk ballad , which was played at various times during the film , called chuck-a-luck , to bolster its theme of "" hate , murder , and revenge . "" this was a ludicrous concept to believe , as if one expected the bandits to be honest with her and give her the exact amount to stay , but it is fair to say , that reality was not one of the film's strong points . it's lang's best and last western , one that covers again the themes he successfully used in his noir films , and one that makes good use of his expressionistic style of filmmaking . but aside from looking old , marlene proved she was up to the part acting-wise , giving a mannered and brilliant performance , making this western a legendary one . it has a certain electricity about it that makes it special , even if does seem a bit corny at times . "
831,"max oph ? ls ( caught/lola montes/the earrings of madame de . . . ) is a director not usually associated with noir film , in fact his films tend to be the antithesis of such films . but , nonetheless , he has come-up with a first-class melodramatic thriller , very much in the noir spirit , by complementing guffey's photographs of shadowy figures and a dark city scene , with long craning shots , quick-darting movements of the heroine's nervous actions , and a style of camerawork that is not necessarily suited for a noir film , using an encircling camera , giving the scene an airy feel of possible freedom . bennett and mason give sterling performances , pulling out all the nuances of their roles . the film is taut and tense , elegantly directed by oph ? ls in a simple but powerful way . a very engaging thriller , every bit as good as the more respectable films the classy director has made . "
832,"a neat noir thriller that has a slight variation on the "" double indemnity "" theme , this time it is the guy who is the seducer . dalton trumbo , the blacklisted writer , is the uncredited cowriter of the script . his trademark signal at the end of his show is , "" i'll be seeing you susan . "" this is particularly annoying for webb , as he calls his voice oily . as for the contemptuous van heflin , who really has a disregard for others , his love for keyes was real but not enough for him , he had to also have the superficial material things of life to satisfy his weak ego . these two stars gave superb performances in this arresting thriller that is scripted with a social conscience and a taut sense of reality . "
833,"cecilia roth , the wonderful argentinian-born actress , is the focal point of the film and it is fair to say that her outstanding performance tries to portray what the director wants to say about the nature of motherhood . in this film there is little difference between what is real and what is fake . this is the 13th pedro almod ? var film i have seen , one that many critics say shows the aging , enfant terrible director maturing , becoming kinder and gentler , showing a capacity for making a film with more of a conventional plot and being less interested in shocking his audience as he once loved to do . but the shock is still there , enough of it to keep it from becoming a mainstream film . to visually show her path back and forth from barcelona to madrid , there is a stunningly photographed tunnel looking very much like a womb , with a train racing through it . though the film has a pungency to it , there are just too many scenes where the wit seems forced and doesn't flow in the natural rhythm of the story . the film is filled with many references and homages to other hollywood films and to writers , something that is both good and bad . it is good because too many films are devoid of any intellectual influences . bad because the references are overused here , making the director's gushy homages too syrupy for my taste buds . but he doesn't know that . this is a story about many different things : its subplots could take you into areas such as organ donors , aids , coincidences , family relationships , family values , and the affects of pop culture on the public ( take note of that hilarious diaper commercial , an actual one shown on spanish tv ) ; but , the film's main premises were about : praising actresses , praising motherhood , praising sexual ambiguity , and praising the kindness from strangers ( tolerance of all people seems to be the strongest message emanating from the film ) . the mixed feelings i got about the film come from my not being sure if this film is meant to be taken as a parody or a tragic soap opera . there were times i didn't know whether i was supposed to laugh at all this or cry . this film is melodramatic in the tradition of the douglas sirk nuclear family romantic rock hudson and dorothy malone ones of the 1950s , but with almod ? var , it becomes even a weepier one , one that is mostly outrageous , one whose family nature is more ambiguous and certainly not nuclear . it is a film that is paradoxical : men can be actresses also . the deftness of the cinematography and the array of colors displayed are simply dazzling . this film could be enjoyed solely for its bright orange , red and yellow patterns , giving the eye a startling light show to feast on , as the camera is constantly moving from one thing of beauty to another . it is worth noting , that there is no criticism by the director for any of his characters , no matter how they screw things up . the problem with all this adulation is that all the flattery has a hollow ring to it , it is just too good to be true , and his characters are not completely believable because of this . the film's strength lies in the emotions of the characters ; their close-ups revealing an inner strength in them , that no matter what they've been through , they will stick together and not succumb to their overwhelming problems . a pregnant nun in an almod ? var film shouldn't be that surprising to his fans , in fact what else should they expect ! this is another of the director's themes , of how the ones who are supposed to be normal and try so hard to convey that impression , are really fakes , while the ones who are considered to be oddballs in society , could be the normal ones , who are at least living out their fantasies . the hurt look on rosa's face after her father leaves , gives us a picture of her thought process that is better than dialogue , it is one that is worth savoring . there is one scene when agrado announces that the performance of "" streetcar . . . "" of course , this clears most of the audience out , with those few remaining being mostly the young and more daring ones , the same audience that has sustained the director over the years . she proceeds to tell how he got put together into a she and how much each part cost , in a comic bit that seemed , at least it did to me , that the director was trying to please his audience too much . trying the actors were all splendid . i was particularly impressed by marisa paredes' subtle but invigorating performance . the aging actress had a certain air about her that invigorated every scene she was in , showing how vulnerable and engaging an actress she is . but when the spotlight was on marisa , what the director was trying to say about actresses' had a clarity about it that didn't seem forced . but still , what makes an almod ? var film special , is his eye for visual effects . i haven't seen a more stunning visual film all year ( it is comparable to kubrick's "" eyes wide shut "" ) . i was so dazzled by the visuals , that the film's metaphors , bizarre tale , and great actors , seem to take second place to the visual splendor of the film . as good as this film is , one of the problems almod ? var still has , is that he can't make his outrageous characters distinguishable from caricatures . this cloy act of his does not make agrado any more compelling . one must give almod ? var credit for getting his voice heard in the mainstream while keeping his artististic integrity intact . that is not an easy thing to do and the director has used the popular vehicle of hollywood melodrama to add his own sense of culture and literary references to it , despite the differences i have with his approach to the characters and their development . the film's story line is ludicrous but the hurt the characters receive as perceived by them is real . almod ? var retains in this work an intriguing call for the bizarre , that keeps the film from descending toward being a hollywood one . but it also never reaches great artistic heights . there are no breakthroughs in character study . this is basically still a message film . a most amusing and diverting portrayal of the sexually ambiguous , but not a great film . the critical success of this film makes for strange bedfellows , when the 'chic' cannes crowd hooted in disappointment that the film wasn't chosen as the best one in the festival , but cheered when almod ? var won for best director , they now might be considered as part of the usual almod ? var fan base of weirdoes and independent-minded movie goers , a fan base that seems to be growing to accomodate a different type of enthusiast , one that is more establishment orientated . "
834,"this is one of the top fight films ever made , along with raging bull and body and soul . it is reportedly the role robert ryan , the college boxing whiz liked the best , and the one he probably gave his best performance in . it is the only boxing film developed from a poem . it was fleshed out into a screenplay by boxing aficionado art cohn . wise captured the mood of the smoked-filled arena , the fans' reactions , and the dirtiness of the boxing world . the film looks as if it is being shot in real time , as stoker awaits in the dressing room , exchanging good-natured barbs with the other boxers present and listening to their nervous chatter . the boxing scenes looked real . the crowd was made up of an assortment of fans , some there to wager , others to eat and enjoy themselves , some getting a kick out of the mayhem seen , and a blind man- having his pal give him a detailed description of the fight- just loving the violence . at this point , tiny tells his fighter the fix is in . ryan's performance gives this film the human drama the other great boxing movies just couldn't deliver . his drive to win despite knowing what that victory will ultimately mean and the noble way he handles himself , provides this film with an insiders look into the boxer's virile nature and the foolish pride he has in winning . the set-up was one of the few films ever made in which narrative time and screen time are the same-72 minutes . wise brought in former boxing professional john indrisano to make sure the choreographed fight scenes were realistic . wise , striving for realism above all , visited the boxing places around the long beach area , basing the boxing fans chosen for the film on the same type of people he saw while attending those matches . "
835,"leos carax's inspiration for this film was jean vigo's masterpiece "" l'atalante "" ( 1934 ) . there is nothing pretty about these characters or endearing about the situation they are in , and it has a frighteningly real look to it . this high-budget fantasy film is directed by leos carax ( boy meets girl/bad blood ) ; it is one of the most costly french films ever made . the story is a quiet one , an imitation of the life and sounds of all the things happening in their surroundings . it is not a story where we are going to find out much about these three , just enough so that we have a little feel of how they came to be there . what this reckless film is about ( it is reckless because it is not about logical people ) , is something that can't easily be explained because it is a poetical vision about those who have gone over the line of sanity . this film is visual cinema , dialogue is not that relevant . we observe the madness of their lives and how love is so difficult to comprehend but is the only thing that is out there that can't be taken away from them , that it becomes the rationale of the film . this could have been made as a silent film , it could be viewed like murnau's "" sunrise , "" as the disenfranchised view the bright lights of a modern urban city for how it might corrupt those who live there . in the meantime , while the film stopped shooting , she had a few breakthrough roles and could have gone to make more glamorous films at higher pay , but she felt committed to this project and did finish the film . commercially the film bombed , but critically it received many great reviews . there were also quite a few negative ones , and the one from vincent canby in the n . y . times really hurt . it delayed the release date in america . the ones who hated this film , seemed to really hate it . i appreciated the film , finding it to be slow-moving but a startling and compelling film , that had a unique way of influencing my sensibilities through its images . not quite a masterpiece , but a film that made my heart go out to its lovers . "
836,"katherine forgives him , and this very strong film ends on a weaker note than i think it should have . to lang's credit , even if this film failed to be a masterpiece because of the interference , it still did not let the good citizens off the moral hook . his portrayal of the attempted lynching was powerfully done and was not compromised . "
837,"there is also a dark side to life that david lynch ( eraserhead/the elephant man/dune ) wants to show you in the underbelly of normalcy and that's what gets explored in this fantastic , original american film of his . jeffrey has entered into a dark world of madness , a world that most of the people of lumberton could never imagine exists in their community . hopper is madly funny and menacing in one of his all-time best over-the-edge roles . he is the energy of the film . he has lines like "" let me f * ck everything that movies ! "" . maclachlan : "" heineken "" hopper : "" f * ck that shit , pabst blue ribbon ! "" there were many quirky moments in a film that was as straight as a curve ball . one conversation between dern and kyle goes like this : laura : "" i don't know if you are a detective or a pervert ! "" jeff : "" that's for me to know and you to find out . "" this is a highly personal film . for those looking to criticize it these might be some reasons to do so : it relies on shock to tell its forgettable story , it fails to develop character emphasizing style instead , and the acting seems more staged than spontaneous . it was shocking to see , but i didn't feel that lynch glossed over this scene lightly . i think it set a mood for how painful and humiliating life is , and these incidences do happen more regularly in contemporary america than some would care to admit . all these possible flaws in the film , still do not detract from how visually powerful the story was and how it had such a unique feel to it , as if it were capturing something about the american heartland that hasn't been told in this way before . i loved the film for its intransigencies . what it has going for it in large measures is a sense of freshness , imagination , and an almost seamless melding of beauty and violence . this non-commercial film should satisfy lynch's fans and those looking for a film that doesn't pull its punches . others might dislike it for being so plainly weird and shock-orientated , admiring it only for its craftsmanship . i think they will have sold this film short ; after all , strange stuff happens all the time , and the most interesting people are the so called "" normal "" ones . i believe that is what happened in this film , and though its motivations are ambiguous , it does hit some kind of sore spot for respectable society to consider , without turning up its nose at all the revolting things this story brought to the surface .

838,"it is a film that should satisfy the protesters of the war for its depiction of it as being without merit , but it also should satisfy those who are entertained by the blood and gore action scenes . it portends to be a film about the real war in vietnam and not someone's metaphor for the war . it is 1967 . on patrol , the stillness of this alien place is disturbing even if it is visually beautiful . no one cares if the new men live or die . if they survive , it will be mostly because of luck . sgt . sgt . these scenes are masterfully done by stone , as it is a reminder of my lai , although it doesn't turn into such a disastrous outcome . it is shown from the soldier's perspective , how war dehumanizes one and survival becomes a basic instinct . some act brutally . some do what is ethical . some just want to make sure they don't overlook the danger they are in and act cautiously . but since the men are in a dangerous situation , it is hard to determine what is really the correct thing to do , except there is no excuse for the excessive cruelty shown by some of the men . this is a visceral film , even if the enemy is not distinguishable in battle and appear like shadowy figures . for some of the others , they will do anything they can to make it out of here . . . even smoke weed until everything seems unreal . platoon is a moving film about the horrors of war . it is a visual film that explores the reality of the actual war , told from the soldier's point of view . it is one of the better war films made because it seems real . the director's one fault , was that he couldn't resist feeding the audience with his opinion , not able to rely completely on the visual impact of his story to do the job . "
839,"the film is grandiose and colorfully shot , seeming much like a travelog . the original film had a more ironical and less standard ending than this version . but this is a highly appetizing film and a more attractive one to view . granger gives a commanding macho performance and the vistas are delightfully magnicent , which should be enough of a reason for seeing this version , also . "
840,"an mgm dazzler , a striking musical , satirizing the staging of a broadway play . it is a technically superior work , making up for a thin plot with plenty of lively musical scores and dance numbers , and a constant barrage of witty dialogue . many critics consider this one to be the best musical of all time . the musical becomes the stage for the battle between pop culture versus high art , with the film favoring the low brow art form . clifton webb was first-choice for the buchanan part , but he turned it down because it wasn't a starring role . however , he did recommend buchanan to the studio for the part , and the studio was rewarded in its choice by getting an outstanding performance from him . this is a film dominated by its magnificent musical numbers scored by howard dietz and arthur schwartz . the songs include the following : 'a shine on your shoes , ' 'dancing in the dark , ' 'that's entertainment , ' 'by myself , ' my favorite number about triplets who do not like each other- 'triplets , ' 'new sun in the sky , ' 'i guess i'll have to change my plans- the highlight of this number is a soft-shoe by astaire and buchanan , ' 'louisiana hayride , ' 'i love louisa , ' and an eight-minute dream number that is the climax of the film-- a jazz-dance spoof on mickey spillane's 'girl hunt , ' with cyd showing off her long dancing legs as a femme fatale in a smoky barroom and delivering a very sexy routine in a sequined red dress and black mesh tights . this technicolor dance routine didn't seem to fit into the rest of the film , except it seemed to point out what the film was trying to say about mixing together both art forms , as the dance was both derived from the lexicon of pop culture and from the high arts . the marton scenarists write a broadway show for tony hunter and get the pretentious jeffrey cordova to direct it . they both feel inferior when not doing the role they feel comfortable in and try to see if they can work out a satisfactory way in which to be dance partners . the martons are disappointed that the director has ignored their script . he converts the play back to the marton's fluffy original script . it all ends on a happily banal note , as they sing 'that's entertainment , ' signifying that whether it's a play by shakespeare or bojangles dancing , you still have to entertain an audience . the arthur freed production team , true to the film's theme , have created a most entertaining film . vincent minnelli's direction was accomplished with much style and panache . if you like an old-fashioned broadway musical , you can't go wrong with this one . "
841,"the naive ? ngela wonders , at first , could a film such as this cause a heart attack for the viewer . chema recognizes that it is a digital camera xt-500 used , by noting the grainy quality of the film . he also chides ? ngela for being so aloof , for not learning much in film school and for not being able to observe the minute details in filmmaking . he feels rejected by her lack of attention to him , and even asks her why don't you like me , i have money , too ! he proclaims that film directors have to make violent films to please the public , and that they have every right to . what the 22-year-old director , amen ? bar , is trying to do , is show that the public is hypocritical in its condemnation of porn/gore films , because these films wouldn't be made if there wasn't such a tremendous market for them . chema says that the police don't like him and that there is no proof . her lone investigation was too much to believe , that for someone as smart as she is , to make herself so vulnerable didn't seem likely . this slick suspense story works very well on capturing her fear and following the trail to the killer , but fails to be convincing in showing how the public's prurient interest in violent smut is the reason filmmaker's make such degrading films . the young director has an exciting way of filming and keeping one engrossed in the story , thereby achieving a very curious fantasy film , one that is filled with many psychological overtones , but it is derivative film and can't lay claim for being original . "
842,"this odets' work was originally performed as a neo-realist broadway play in 1941 , with tallulah bankhead in the stanwyck role . she can't resist anymore and tries to make a relationship with earl work , fed-up that jerry is so dull . the performances are stagy but filled with fiery emotion . everything about these characters and their alienation seemed natural , something that was grounded by lang's showing them at work , never cutting them off from all the travails they were going through just to exist . it's a film that reminded me of how easy it is , not to see the faults in yourself as easy as it is too see it in someone else . "
843,"everyone knows how bad it is to be called a chicken--it could mess up one's self-image worst than the wind can mess up a ducktail haircut for a teenager in the 1950s--as this liberal-inspired social commentary film plunges right into that 1950s eisenhower era mind-set , without trepidation . it's a film that sympathetically sides with the rebellious youths and their befuddled parents , and it doesn't even demonize the police . it airs out the prevalent problems of the mid-'50s for these youngsters ; such as , loneliness , alienation , lack of love , fitting in with their peers , their identity crises , and the lack of communication with their folks . all these well-off kids ride to school together in this open car , acting loud and stupid , proud to be dumb americans . for all its aging and the changing mores of the times and the ever-increasing complexities of modern youth , this creaky film still has a rawness about it , something that is intangible , that gets into your spine and brings out a chill or two , that tells you this dramatization was real . "
844,"stage fright is a hardly frightening but , nonetheless , laudable movie , that features hitchcock's droll humor and his perfection in regards to set arrangements . this is a mystery tale that is not too difficult to figure out who the guilty party is , but the fun comes in playing along with the man on the run theme and to follow along with his love stricken wannabe actress maiden heroine and her eccentric family , and take-in the mae west-like performance from the incomparable marlene dietrich , as charlotte inwood , a stage actress/chanteuse with a rather vulgar personality and an odd sense of humor , who rules the london stage world as if she were a pampered peacock with fangs . this film is more of a romantic comedy than a suspense film , though there is an element of grave danger that comes about in the final scene for the heroine . she is acceptable in this damsel-in-distress role , but doesn't really sparkle in the role and make you feel for her , perhaps , like a grace kelly would have . this film , the second one hitchcock has done in england since his return there from america , is one of the master's most subtle and sharpest comic efforts . stage fright is sandwiched in between hitcock's "" under capricorn "" and "" strangers on a train "" , and is equal to if not better than both . this is certainly not hitchcock's best work , it is not suspenseful enough for that , after all , the master of suspense should live up to his reputation . but , the film is very diverting and artfully done , and dietrich was never better . watching her performance alone , was enough for me to love this hitchcock work , even though it is merely a minor one in his opus . "
845,"poetry is the vehicle of choice for how the story is best transcribed onscreen , since dialogue is almost non-existent . it is told as if time doesn't exist , one event runs into another and everything seems jumbled . images of water and fire are used throughout the film for purposes of symbolically cleansing the soul and destroying the impurities in it . paint is used as a contrast to blood . in a film loaded with contrasts , the huge gap between most of the population which is poor , is harshly contrasted with those who have money to burn . innocence is being corrupted by the experienced , proving that nothing remains pure in this city that steals one's life , one's poetry , and one's spirit . which signifies that there is something despairing about the foreign influence in vietnam , but what that despair exactly means , is never clearly stated in the context of the story . he somehow keeps her a virgin by having her do all the kinky sex tricks that do not involve touching , like peeing for a customer . this film is a visual masterpiece , capturing the frenetic pace of life in the city and the faces of sorrow on the poor ; it paints an unsentimental picture of a place that is a living hell . but it is not a masterpiece storywise , as its storyline was rambling , laying no specific blame for what is happening on the local government or for that matter , on anyone , only implying how rotten the western influence is . also , it seemed to me , there were too many violent scenes , as the filmmaker seems to revel in them without expounding on them . this powerful film offers westerners a potent dosage of what life is like in a third world country , a country most americans only envision in a depersonalized way , but the film still had too many gaps in its storytelling and too many loose ends it left not fully developed . cyclo , as a person , should have been more flesh-and-blood like , rather than used as merely a morbid symbolic example of the loss of innocence . there was something there that just seemed to be elusive about the film , the director just wouldn't let the viewer get into without imposing his own personal barriers ; he doesn't even want to give us their real names , as if he thought , we would sully their hardships even more than it already is . he mainly wants to shock our sensibilities , to have us look plaintively at his native country like he does , even if he too is only a tourist . there is nothing wrong with that in itself , but his social designs could have been painted with clearer brush strokes . the contrast between those who are gentle and those who are brutal , and those who are dreamers and those who can't dream anymore , could have been better utilized than to point out the obvious , of how wretched a place this is and of how the gentle ( innocent ) have little chance of succeeding . still , this is one powerful film , filled with relentless and disturbing visualizations , whose poetic voice comes from the inside of the director and is strong and boiling over with metaphorical emotion . cyclo was a deserved winner of a golden lion award for best film at the venice film festival . "
846,"a thoroughly enjoyable film about a pitiless serial killer of middle-aged women , that is played for laughs at the expense of the women victims . it is a black comedy , acclaimed for its stellar performances , especially by rod steiger as christopher gill , the psychologically warped killer , with a severe mother fixation , who uses a number of disguises to commit the murders and performs the murders as if he was on-stage , being only natural , considering that he is an accomplished broadway actor and well-known theater owner , and the son of a great actress . this presents an interesting contrast with the way the killer handles his neuroses . his performance is endearing and heckart's is amusingly right on target . she is delightfully refreshing , offering her beauty , sensitivity , and comedy in a splendid performance . this is an actor's film and they all make the most of it . steiger calls him the next day and offers to become segal's telephone confidant , but tells him , "" remember , i am smarter than you are . "" it was difficult not to find this witty film funny and its romantic subplot equally charming . "
847,"taxman is a wonderfully played cynical , offbeat , low-key thriller with comic undertones , also exhibiting plenty of local atmosphere and human intensity . the israeli-born avi nesher co-wrote the screenplay with roger berger , who did the real-live tax investigation of this actual case . nesher directed the film with a flare for making a caper film come to life . unfortunately , no one else cares . they both can't help it , they have personalities that rub people the wrong way , even if they don't mean to be annoying and are supposedly intelligent , they are still kept at the bottom-level of their jobs . the film had many different mood swings -- ranging from the joyous russian wedding reception for nadia the two sleuths attended , their frustrating conversations about the ups-and-downs of the case , and the action-packed mob hit by the two suicidal chechnyan hit men of the likable gas station owner , and the chase of one of the hit men through the off-season beachfront property of coney island . in the end , these two did all they could to get justice , and the results were mixed , but better than what could be expected . the film had many endearing qualities : the cast was magnificent ; the novice cop was an unforgettable character ; the taxman was even more unforgettable ; elizabeth berkley is a beautiful sight for sore eyes and her russian accent was as good as pate from zabars ; and , the story , though thoroughly routine , was presented with a certain grittiness that elevated it to the level of those el trains running above the brighton beach russian community . "
848,"the vanishing is a challenging psychological thriller about a nightmare that comes true and an obsession that leads to bizarre results . it makes the most of its tale by its vivid dream sequences and the masterly holding off of its inevitable findings until its conclusion , as it relies on the viewer becoming overwhelmed with curiosity to hang on until the end . it is a superbly done suspense yarn relating to what lengths someone will go to find out something that he feels he must know about himself , as this tale is told without the usual horror film special effects . it consists of the real everydayness situations , which makes the mystery seem even scarier . the theme of disappearance has been attempted by many great directors , such as hitchcock , in his the lady vanishes , but it has never been done as spookily as it is here and from such a simple storyline . each time he goes to the designated spot of the meeting there is no one there , but he feels the presence of that person . the performances are particularly good , with gene bervoets being made into a victim , becoming a kafkaesque figure , trapped in a world that is not of his making . while johanna ter steege gives the film an inner light that captures the prevailing mood of the mystery . she is so sweet , honest , and endearing , that the continuing curiosity gene shows for what happened to her is very understandable . and , bernard-pierre donnadieu is perfectly credible as a self-absorbed psycho , someone who is devoid of passion , as his crime is not sexually motivated even if he seems to only target pretty woman ( he says that he does so because they don't expect to be victims ) . this film is so well-crafted , that it is easy to get carried away and think that more is being said here than what has transpired . but in the simplicity of its story , it becomes easy to identify with the amsterdam couple and feel caught up in their dreamworld which intermingles with their real-life . a film that is very much in the hitchcock suspense mode , as a real-chiller .

849,"a thoroughly enjoyable claude chabrol detective story , covering ground the director is very familiar with from his previous successes with this kind of a mystery story . the director is in a playful mood and builds a crime scene around kinky characters , hypocrites , lowlifes , and druggies , as he parodies bourgeois life . the film starts with a surprise and ends with a debatable moral ending to the murder case , which is geared to be pleasing to the audience's sense of what is right rather than one that follows the law or the integrity of the inspector's profession . the inspector is the focal point of the film and the way he operates is a rough imitation of sherlock holmes . his reactions to what occurs is how we are led to believe we should see the film . poiret is superb , his dry wit and the persistent way he carries out the investigation , sets the film's laconic tone , setting up the bizarre turn of events in a magnificently comic fashion . this is a purely entertaining film , with no great insights into life to be discovered but , with some great looks at how absurd life really is . the joy in the film is expressed best through the following actors : the dreamy and soft performance of lafont , the spry and eccentric performance from brialy , who was in a chabrol film some thirty years ago , and from poiret's strongly understated performance , holding back his feelings by letting his action do the talking . this is chabrol at his most playful , which offers some surprises , shocks , and amusement .

851,"this lyrical film shared with "" taste of cherry "" the palme d'or for 1997 . it's a virtuous film that after its violent beginning settles down and becomes an amusing and insightful study about a man trying to find himself after spending the last eight years in prison . it is interesting to note how this couple take this murderer into their home , something that would not likely happen in america . though imamura paints yamashita's character as being serious and withdrawn , there are comical interludes which make him seem plain daffy . he explains , that he talks to the eel because he listens to what i say . an interesting film , that works most effectively as an introspective study of how to deal with one's anger and love .

852,"he speaks in a hesitatingly slow , thick southern drawl , and is a very modest , inward man . his life is a difficult one , where his level of discomfort is beyond reasonable expectations . but he is not dull . all the film's energy goes into ian holm's stellar performance . this is a wonderful screen adaption , as scripted by howard a . rodman , who caught the nostalgic and generous mood of greenwich village of the 1940s . ian holm's performance is brilliant and sparkling , one of his best in his long and distinguished career . this cautionary story pictures a city that has changed so much from joe gould's time , that a talented eccentric nowadays should expect to receive no help from a city that is becoming less interested in helping its weirdo artists or its mentally ill , instead turning its attention to more mundane concerns . "
853,"this is an overlooked noir thriller--shamefully it couldn't get a british film distributor to give it a wide release when it opened . jack wants to do things in a honest way to win , whether as a writer or as a croupier , who makes it a point of telling us how much he hates cheats , yet by a twist of fate , part of the forced psychodynamics of the story , jack ends up like all the other cheats , choosing to be dishonest . the cynical message inferred , is that one can't change human nature , that sooner or later one will have to make a choice and bend the rules to accomodate who one is . in a plot that can be faulted only for its contrived surprise ending and a death of one of the main players near the end , that adds absolutely nothing to the story , what remains striking , is the passion the croupier has for casino life and how it relates to his passion for writing . but , as with the many other subplots , its theme is never fully realized . when compared to three recent films about gambling , "" casino , "" "" the rounders "" and "" reindeer games , "" there is no comparison , this one was the more real and pertinent one . it is only too bad that "" croupier "" couldn't feel more committed to the power of the lyrical voice-over and less to the canned responses of all the odd twists it had to throw into the story , that diminished the bleak truth it was harping at -- of how life itself is a game of chance and the casino is only a cheap imitation of life . in the end , the film's stylish depiction of the casino milieu , its thrilling noir ambiance , and the character study of the croupier , override the film's failure to end the film convincingly with the kind of payoff that this thriller warranted . it turns out , that this compelling story is just as much about being a writer as it is about being a croupier . but the ace it has up its sleeve , is the distinguished performance by clive owen . "
854,"this is a well crafted sci-fi film from the 1950s , that became a cult favorite and helped generate interest in the sci-fi film as a popular genre . it had a well-intentioned liberal message in the face of the time's mccarthy witch hunts , it only lacked an edge to its straightforward rational call for world peace and an end to the nuclear arms race . this intelligent and humanitarian film plays like a christian allegory . klaatu even uses the alias mr . carpenter , an obvious reference to christ . lock martin played gort . bernard herrmann's brilliantly haunting musical score aided in capturing the alien atmosphere of the story . it's hard to argue with the rational message delivered , i just wished the film took on the politics of the scientists sleeping in the same bed with the government , who are just as much a detriment to world peace as the xenophobic media and the cowardly bunch of world leaders . "
855,"it sets a high standard for submarine films , as a well-crafted , serious work , that created a lot of nail-biting tension and evoked a suspenseful atmosphere , and might very well be the best submarine film ever made . wolfgang petersen was nominated but did not win an oscar for his directing . it also gave the director a chance to come to hollywood to show off his ability to shoot action films , where he made "" in the line of fire "" / "" air force one "" / "" perfect storm . "" das boot was one of the most popular foreign films in america at the time , and is still doing very well in its video rentals . the ships were escorted by destroyers and were sometimes protected by airplanes . that was an amazing scene . i couldn't imagine a hollywood film showing americans not rescuing drowning seamen , even if their submarine had no room for the prisoners . what this excellently told story fails to do , is come to terms with the political situation or the moral implications of the war . it is seen best as a film that is technically superb , drawing out the reality of what it is like to be on the submarine and showing how terrible it is to go to war . the boat constructed by rolf zehetbauer and g ? tz weidner , which duplicates the cramped boat down to its grimy details , and provides the film with the proper setting for its intense realism . the superb use of sound , helped elevate this film above all other submarine films , as every sound in the quiet of the submarine is heard : the splashing against a destroyer's propellers , the eerie ping sounds , the bellowing roar of a depth charge , and the creaks of a hull . jurgen prochnow's sterling performance gave the film the quiet hero it needed to anchor its story , as his will to fight , his intelligent leadership , and his quiet determinism to fight a glorious war , were nobly shown , as the men under him completely respected him . the crew was made up of sympathetic figures and not cardboard nazis most ww11 films seen from an american perspective portray onscreen for the germans . what the film seemed to be aiming at , was not a big statement against war , but how the captain was a professional and treated his men accordingly , expecting them to do their best no matter what . the film succeeds in humanizing the men in this mostly true story , as it highlights the crew when it is singing their favorite song , "" it's a long way to tipperary , "" and that's the most vocal this very quiet , very emotionally gripping , and very entertaining film will get about anything . "
856,"kadosh means sacred in hebrew . this is a controversial film , in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones , that the film is bound to anger most viewers , no matter their belief . it is a slow-moving , meticulous film , that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go . the force of what is seen , though filmed in an objective manner , never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim , is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance . meir is a talmudic scholar . meir's response , is that it is written like that in the talmud . but the choices are obliterated by one's beliefs , circumstances , and inward nature , and how difficult it is to carry out those choices if it goes completely against the way one is brought up . "
857,"this might be the best junkie film ever made . the new zealander , alison maclean ( crush ) , directed denis johnson's book of short dramatic stories with a sharp eye for comedy , where the addiction story plays second fiddle to the overall psychological problems of the addict . billy crudup is simply ingenious in this sterling role as the poetic voice of the author , making the internal musings of denis johnson's disjointed surreal stories come to life , not quite like in the book , but in its own cinematic way . that this impossible book was adapted to the screen , is a minor miracle itself , though it is certainly not a fault-free film , as it petered out toward the end from sluggishness . but if viewed as a story that doesn't have to make too much sense , because a junky' life doesn't make too much sense anyway , then the film can be savored for its fair quota of highs . the film is divided into chapter headings , which are flashed onscreen , as fh rants on like the stoned out freak he is . there might be some unintentional moral to the story at this point , as they both take the heroin but wayne keels over dead from it . "" jesus' son , "" a title snatched from a lou reed song , has many glorious moments of dry humor , pungency , sadness and unpredictability ; it exhibits the rare quality all special films have , it requires some effort to see what the film is about , and though it is a likable film , it does not aim to please its audience . it is a film that zig-zags all over the map , with its target being pop culture in america and how one survivor of the drug culture , who is so disarming and real , will have his maddening story breathe life into his messed up junkie veins and give vent to dreams he has that are as relevant as any genuine religious experience . "
858,"it featured a young cast , hungry to make its mark in films . this surprisingly realistic war drama , caught a dark side to the war in a very personal way that very few films have captured . the film had the same gritty feel to it that sam fuller's "" the steel helmet "" had , but the emphasis here is more on a psychological nature than fuller's cultural one . endore is one of those people who can't live by the rules , considering them to be mostly unnecessary . on a personal level , the psychological effects of the war are seen through the conflict between loomis and endore . the sheer black-and-white photography caught the expansive mood of the troops in the battlefield , and its grainy quality helped the viewer see the war in a personalized way , as in the scene where the idealist loomis is fighting for his survival in a hand-to-hand fight with a chinese soldier . this is a wonderfully maddening film . there couldn't be a more pronounced statement about the insanity of war than this gritty film offers , as seen mainly through the dead-pan eyes of a psychopath . "
859,"a strangely intriguing , darkly made psychological allegory based on the late walker hamilton's only novel . it is the directorial debut film of jeremy thomas , the producer of bertolucci , roeg , and cronenberg films , and the husband of the screenwriter eski thomas . the film works its way to a suspenseful but tacky and implausible revenge conclusion , as all its energy seems to have been spent on its fairy tale setup and the relationship between the two kindred spirits . but , nevertheless , this film , if you allowed it to be seen as a proficiently lyrical work , one that is heartfelt and never false , then you can feel the sincerity of it and you can see in the grand shots of bobby's escape to the wilderness , away from civilization , as he earnestly narrates his tale of woe offscreen , how poetical the film is and how it is a modern fairy tale for adults and fans of the cinema that still believe that movies can make them see things again as they did when they were children . "
860,"abbas kiarostami's brilliantly perceptive film is based on a true story , but is done in mock-documentary style . this slow-moving , temperately structured film , shot in the cin ? ma-v ? rit ? style so that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between what is real and what is reconstructed , has a curious fascination about it . he just reads books on film and has never worked on one before , but always wanted to be a director . he also looks somewhat like the director , but not enough to fool anyone who has ever seen what the director looks like . the film has a somewhat curious aesthetic feel to it , as the director's motivations seem to be largely a test for the audience to see if they really know what they are getting from their experience in viewing a film . all those who testify , tell the truth from their own viewpoint , as some of the dialogue is pleasingly witty and some of the observations made are extremely sharp . at the film's conclusion , kiarostami wants to make sure that we know it is only a film , as he has the pardoned sabzian return with flowers to the home of mr . ahankhah . the director forces us to be alerted that what we are seeing is not real life , and that it is made possible only through technology . he is not a criminal in the sense of what we think a criminal is , and this compelling film lets us think of him in whatever way we want to , as we watch this film as viewer , judge , and jury . the marvelous thing , is that kiarostami can get superb performances from the non-professional actors as well as the professionals , because as sabzian stated during the trial , acting is just being yourself , letting it all come out from the heart . this is just a wonderful film , with kiarostami's humor prevailing . it is also an interesting look at modern iran , its bureaucracy , its class divisions , its high unemployment , and its seemingly fair-minded court system .

862,"the family is more complex than a mob family has a right to be , and the philosophical lines they spout , in this slow-moving , almost actionless film for this genre , sometimes seems bizarre but has a strange pull to it , one that keeps you wondering what's going on with these dangerous criminals , as their lives begin to unravel during the funeral . this is the most powerful scene in the film and it is brilliantly accomplished . but the film can't end on that prosaic note , this film is heading down a more philosophical and catholic path , as the end is so unexpected and makes so little sense , no matter how you try to explain it , that we can only guess what the director means . the picture works despite the bizarre ending , because it is gritty and seems real , in the sense that so many families are dysfunctional in america , that there is no reason why a long-standing mob family shouldn't also be plagued with family problems . chris penn's performance earned him the "" best supporting actor "" award at the 1996 venice film festival and the film won the special jury prize . but i didn't think he was something special , as much as he gave the film energy . the gallo character , despite a lot of attention placed on it , is never uncovered , and his performance only seemed adequate . he has a great line , though , where he says , "" life is pointless without the movies . "" i thought the glue to this film , was walken's mesmerizing performance , who is able to say with a straight face , that the flaw in a criminal's character , is that he is not trustworthy . he and his wife are the only characters that i really felt for , who seemed to be touching something deep down and bringing it up for examination . that is the message ferrara brings with this anti-gangster gangster film , who digresses to talk about other topics such as capitalism and sexual kinkiness , but only in a cursory way . the film has a black humor to it and a dark side that is darker than the typical 1940 noir films were . the emotions here are allowed to run over the screen and , all the diversions to the plot and even the plot itself , are not as important as delving into the emotional make up of the lead characters . it is an engrossing film , one of the better gangster films , even though it is flawed by the director's inability to stay in focus and maintain a coherent narrative . "
863,"this debut indie film for director steven soderbergh is a stimulating but perverse psychological drama . the film is invasive sexually , but not in an explicit way , as there is no nudity and the film eschews sensationalism for an honest verbal character study . it is more interested in telling about the gulf between what is felt and what is perceived , as the main characters try to articulate what is at the root of their problems . at the cannes film festival , this low budget film , made for about $1 . 2 million , deservedly won la palme d'or for best film and the best actor award for james spader . this is much more than a voyeuristic film , as everything becomes personal . the script is intelligent ; the acting is superb ; and , the director has elicited spontaneous and natural performances , weaving it into a film where having a conversation about masturbation is as natural as talking about the weather . this is a film where sex is always kept as an intriguing mystery and a part of the story that adds spice to the wry humor of the events . and the trophy wife , can only respond , "" i like the stability and john's promotion . "" all the sexual ambiguity they both have for each other changes into a real liking they have for each other and an acceptance of how they are damaged goods but have the possibilty of changing for the better . the clever story becomes very emotionally satisfying , even if it ties things up a little too neatly . "
864,"i enjoyed this film much better than when i first saw it in a theater many years ago , as i watched this b/w noir thriller recently on tmc and got a better feel for this fugitive on-the-run film , one that spawned a new genre . delmar daves , the writer/director , has done a more than credible job in catching the tense atmosphere involving the characters and the san francisco locale . the film is almost stolen by bizarre performances by both agnes moorhead as the nosey madge , and by clifton young as baker , the small-time hood with the crooked smile and the even more crooked heart . parry is never seen , as we only hear his voice for about an hour into the film , seeing a picture of him only in the newspaper as an escapee , as he tells his tale from his subjective viewpoint . the hard-lucked parry hitches a ride with the much too inquisitive baker . the use of the first person point-of-view camera through the film's first thirty minutes , was interesting and actually better done than the use of such a similar camera gimmick in "" lady in the lake , "" which did it an year earlier . what makes this noir slightly different than others , is that bogart's troubles are from external matters , not from his own character flaws , like in most noir film . the fatalism commonly developed in the internal structures of most noir protagonists , is just not relevant to the bogart character , who ends up in a happy relationship with the one he loves , anyway . "
865,"say anything . . . first-time director cameron crowe who was to go on and make many successful films ( singles/jerry maguire ) , including his latest "" almost famous , "" gives his due respect to these teenage characters , whose character are rarely treated in such films in such a plausible human way . that alone is enough to make this a superior film , but besides that , the film was superbly scripted and acted , with tremendous use of the characters interacting in a real way . finally , we have a teen film that doesn't dumb down its story line and play it as a goofy teen film . the important thing here is that everyone was presented in a real way , even the irs agents were given more than one dimension , and therefore it meant something to see how the relationship between the teenage couple developed . "
866,"but until then , it just seemed like a very entertaining pop culture film , whose satire comes about in comic-strip form , as it tweaks the side of sensibility in favor of perversity . but then again , it is quite possible that the film is so polemic and so full of contempt for society , that its theme revolves around the scientists surviving in a wasteland anyway they can ( maybe a referral to t . s . if that is the case and i suspect it is , then this film becomes a more sublime work than i thought at first , chewing off more than what can be seen . its ideas do not completely vanish in flames by the film's end but just smolder , even though the film never veers from being nihilistic . the dutch-born paul verhoeven ( starship troopers/total recall/showgirls/basic instinct ) , a director i never thought much of before as being subtle , thoroughly hating his fascistic parody , starship troopers , and being only mildly accepting of his other sleazy films , directed this thriller with an eye to his staple signature as an auteur -- of misanthropy and lurid erotic behavior combined with mindbending special-effects . the special effects are truly stunning , as we watch the gorilla become invisible , as her body when it changes looks like one of those see-through bodies in an anatomy textbook . i might not have had much use for the creepy sebastian , but i understood his human defects : his selfish motivations and his sexual curiosity , as annoying as those faults may be , at least it is something that was explored by the director in his invisible man theme , something other filmmakers of invisible men films haven't done , giving fire to the role kevin bacon so ably played . i also found elisabeth shue to be alluring , offering beauty and vulnerability , a sense of feminine instinctiveness , intelligence and of endeavor , in a film that caught an hypnotic sense of cynicism and ran with it . the remaining cast members looked as if they would be part of a research team and filled the film with the proper atmosphere needed . this is not a slasher film per se but it could be , it had all the gore required for a movie appealing to teens looking for a film with a quick mindless thrill . i found it to be most like a pop culture treat ala hollywood , adding its own brand of vitriolic delights to the sci-fi/horror genre , which has spawned many films with much the same tendencies , such as "" aliens "" and "" the fly ( 86 ) , "" but none with the same erotic tendencies and magnificent special effects . this one's a visual delight , much more intense and sleazier than the other recent similar films of this type , but one that can only push the pop culture button so far , because what does it all mean seems to be lost in the hollowness of the story itself . "
867,"first time director/writer khyentse norbu has created a pleasingly gentle comedy with pressing political undertones . it is genuinely acted by the nonprofessional cast living in the monastery , presumably playing roles of themselves . khyentse norbu , the bhutanese-born lama , has more in mind than just making pictures like his favorite director ozu does . . . as he seems more intent in telling about overcoming hatred in oneself , which is deemed as the buddhist way to overcome all one's enemies . the cup was a crowd favorite at the toronto film festival , which is easy to see why , in a film that tries very hard to bring the stern monastic world of the monks together with a more lighthearted secular approach to the modern conditions the monks are now faced with . the story is a true one , which should add relevancy to this very human , amusing and poignant tale . geko will join him , wondering why he's not watching the game , since he made such a big fuss about it . it's a small but telling story , more european in flavor than american , but deserving of much praise for its heartening universal human message . the film itself , makes no splash cinema-wise , as its story is told in a conventional art-house style . but this film has ingrained in it more than merely its inspirational story , it is a film about a culture that is currently being persecuted and threatened with genocide , and the noble tibetan answer is to fight back by being as a human as possible , not resorting to violence , only acting in the most civilized way possible , making their actions , no matter what they are involved in , a moral lesson to the world . this film utters such a human cry against oppression and even in the lighthearted style that it was presented , its political message about the meaning of freedom is nevertheless an urgent one , one well-worth listening to and not turning away from the film with a cynical knee-jerk reaction , by complaining as to how plain the story is . if that's all you see about this film , a bunch of kids watching a soccer game on satellite tv , then i think you missed its message in this lifetime . "
868,"though kitano has strong feelings for them , probably reminded through them of his own unsteady youth , he nevertheless doesn't let them off the hook , showing their many faults and blemishes , and their immaturity and lack of discipline that is needed to succeed . this is one of the better boxing/troubled teenager movies i have seen , very much in the style of those old warner brothers bogie films . there is a freshness and a spark in it that is very easy to feel . these were characters placed in situations where they are still so young , that their current downfall does not necessarily mean curtains for them . kitano continues to make offbeat films that are packed with a wallop . this film has his same intense rhythms and visuals as his other great gangster films , but it is less violently graphic . the director is so confidant of what he is doing that the character of shinji shines ever so strongly , despite long periods of him remaining quiet . kitano's unique gift is in his understanding of the troubled youths and in his humorous presentation of them , one that is given with a gently bemused but forgiving look at how the teens do such stupid things as kids . a most interesting and perceptive film . "
869,"a purely hollywood hokum story of the lycanthropy legend , but done with much gusto and fun . the cast is superb , the atmosphere of an english village with an alpine background setting and plenty of fog and dense woods , gives the film an eerie look . the dialogue is spellbinding at times . the film covers all angles about werewolves , as curt siodmak's original script is so believable that films ever since have used the nonsense he perpetrated here as the absolute gospel for horror films . gwynn was too far away to see what happened . "" thewolf man "" is some kind of special b-movie , it works so well , even if the story is impossible to believe , because of the stellar cast and that there is a modern link between the wolfish desires of the lon chaney character and how society can't help itself today in the same psychologically wolfish way as the wolf man was trapped in . the film had an undeniable special quality about it that imbued it with a lasting magic . this one's a classic , one of the greats in the horror genre . "
870,"an astute political film about an idealistic liberal lawyer concerned with community grass roots issues . the film is so realistic , probably , because it was written by a senator eugene mccarthy speechwriter jeremy larner , who won the oscar for his original screenplay . it is directed by michael ritchie ( downhill racer ) , who does a good job keeping the film afloat with black humor and tension . it thankfully never sinks into melodrama because it stays with the campaign without padding on an unnecessary plot . the only difficulty i had with the film , is that it is not easy to parody the political scene , which is already a parody of itself . this intelligent film shows that better than any other political film i have seen thus far : it magnifies what the seduction of power can do to someone , even an idealist like the redford character . the candidate , though , compromised , still remains a somewhat ambiguous sympathetic figure , someone who still might be effective as a senator , even though he is flawed . which supposedly means , for the moment , what do you have to lose , just be yourself , no one expects you to win . the change in mckay's message is not without misgivings on his part , but what the film does well is keep the focus on the campaign . he also energizes the apathetic electorate with basically the same tired political rhetoric his opponent is saying , but he has charisma and it somehow sounds fresh coming from his lips . it would be too easy to blame it on the system , which this film correctly doesn't do . this hollywood film has passed the test of time and is still a good watch , especially , during an election year . and , even though the times have changed from the 1970s , the political process still looks the same , if that is possible to believe . "
871,"agnes varda's first color film is shot in very warm and pleasing pastel hues , capturing the beautiful french countryside and the ordinary dwellings where the family featured resides . the mozart playing in the background instills a dream-like magic into the lush natural settings . what makes this film somewhat unique , is that jean-claude drouot's real wife and kids portray his movie spouse and offspring . marital bliss cannot be more idyllic than as it is shown on this picnic . spoiler to follow : if you don't want to know the main event in the story , skip the next paragraph and go on to the last paragraph . this is a very sensual and visually satisfying film , one that shows how each of the characters is stuck in their own romantic dream-world . it might not have a very absorbing tale to tell , but it packs a more deep-seated emotional charge than what might appear at first glance . "
872,"spoiler to follow : skip to last paragraph if you don't want to know the details of harry's investigation . this is the best film that arthur penn has done . the acting is thoughtfully and purposefully carried out . hackman's characterization of this is superb . this excellently scripted film by alan sharp , captures the mood of the country at the time among many who felt they survived vietnam , the jfk assassination and the white house scandal , but still feel weary and uncertain about the future , as it seems as if no matter what they do or how smart they become , they are still going around in circles . it is sort of like playing the grand master in chess and you know what move to trap him , but you still screw up somehow and lose . "
873,"an iconoclastic biopic about the adventurous 17th century late-renaissance painter michelangelo merisa da caravaggio , who was born in 1573 and died in 1610 . the baroque artist is superbly played by nigel terry and the story is brilliantly adapted to the screen by english director derek jarman . it is very sensually done , emphasizing the artist's gargantuan appetites for bisexual and , especially , homosexual affairs with his models , the various scandals he was involved in--including murder , his tricky dealings with the church , and the director's playful anachronisms , purposefully including in his film the modern street sounds as background . successfully filmed on a very restricted budget , which only proves , if you know how to shoot a film , you can do it on shoestring budget and still come up with an outstanding film . his original way of shooting a biopic ( highly personal but still factual ) , whereby caravaggio's most famous works are recreated with actors who are filmed in a style true to caravaggio's chiaroscuro paintings ( the artist's gift to the art world ) , makes for a one of a kind film . jarman creates an inspiring visual atmosphere for nigel terry's brooding artist portrayal , of the artist on his death bed . this art house film , a classic in gay cinema reaching out to a mainstream audience , the director's most accessible film , was winner of the silver bear at the 1986 berlin film festival . that this film should make us concerned about this intemperate artist , which is not an easy task to do , is accomplished despite telling us as little about him as possible , but letting us instead examine him and his paintings in exacting detail by using close-ups and by making his death watch a solemn scene , befitting a giant of a man passing before mere mortals . the film captures the turbulent nature of the artist , accurately showing his inventive art technique ( the basis for current movie lighting techniques ) , and it relates how the low birth artist still had so much anger in him even as he grew in status and how he always painted in such a feverish pitch , always the passionate artist . the film also lets us see how he can so easily kill someone he loved because he believed he was doing something that was just . as a result this is a dark but imaginative look at the artist , one that has weight to it and works very well , which should be more pleasing to art lovers than the general public . "
874,"this is sam peckinpah's masterpiece . the opening scene highlights peckinpah's theme of man's inherent violent nature from childhood and points to the bloodshed that will come in the film's payoff , as he shows a bunch of mexican children poking a stick at a writhing scorpion being devoured by killer ants and of them laughing as they watch . thereby the memorable closing scene , which is a picture of pure violence as an answer to everything , as the generalissimo's men and pike's remaining men shoot it out , leaving no survivors . they don't make violent westerns like this one anymore , but they tried to imitate it many times , but they could never quite capture the spirit that this classic western had . "
875,"it is superbly acted and photographed , and even if the irwin shaw short story the film is adapted from seems aimless , there is a poignancy that rings true underlining the inscrutability of the characters . since a one-night stand didn't materialize , the boys forget about the nice girls . "
876,"lewton's fingerprints are all over the literary script that was made into an intelligent , well-crafted and bizarre thriller . it is noirish in attitude and gothic in tone , enhanced by dark shadowy cinematography and mark robson's crisp direction , which brings about a mixture of ominous danger and a feel for the offbeat . it opens with a grim john donne poem to set the stage for the upcoming action , "" i run to death , and death meets me as fast , and all my pleasures are like yesterday . . . "" . it's easy to dismiss the film's flaws , such as cramming too much story into such a short time frame of 71 minutes , but it is better to concentrate on the artfully told b-film and all the personal touches found that make the film so clever . when viewed that way , this low-budget film is simply superb , equal to producer val lewton's "" cat people "" ( 42 ) . for its time period of the 1940s , it bravely touches on suicide as a necessary part of the plot and covers satanic cults in a mature manner , by showing that ordinary types can join such a cult . "
877,"an enjoyable , witty hollywood satire from director-writer david mamet , who presents a sharp comedy that rails against his own acting community , but says they're no different than any small community in america . if you love snappy dialogue , characters who are insightful , and a healthy sprinkling of sheer playfulness you will find this film an old-fashioned delight , much like the sophisticated comedies of preston sturgess . it's a gift for fiction . "" there is a running gag throughout the film from two stoic yankees , with lines that are pure mamet delights , as these two old-time vermonters who are nonplussed by all the fuss in town over the hollywood people have a dialogue that goes like this : woodchuck #1 : "" it takes all kinds . "" woodchuck #2 : "" that's what it takes ? i always wondered what it took . "" the greatness in the film , is that it was hysterically funny and it kept me laughing for the entire film , but it also was insightful , picking up on the hollywood phoniness and taking it for a nice ride through rural america . the film felt more stagy than cinematic , more apish of hollywood's cynicism than not , but that's ok , it still had some bite to it by way of some crisp dialogue and from some well-timed comedy routines . standing out from this fine ensemble cast was david paymer , who was priceless as the unscrupulous jewish stereotype of a hollywood figure , portraying asmarmy producer-lawyer ( perhaps only a witty jewish director such as mamet can get away with such a vile character depiction without being called to the carpet for it ) . philip seymour hoffman , who never fails to give a great performance , is here asked to carry the film's theme of whether he can carry out a convenient lie to save his hollywood career or is he just an old-fashioned guy who can't lie worth a damn . william h . macy nearly had me rolling in the aisle with his quick-witted delivery and nonstop diatribes . "
878,"mystery of mr . it is a witty , well crafted thriller , that has a charm to it that sparkles like a diamond . the mystery of mr . x was remade in 1952 as the hour of thirteen . "
879,"in this minimalist tale , the two are interviewed separately by an unseen jacques viala , who could never get either one of them to reveal their fantasy , and what's more , they sometimes had different impressions about the affair . interestingly , this is a very steamy story , but the sex is not explicit . . . as we also see that they are both sensitive , intelligent and respectable people . it was a great bedroom lovemaking scene , which was intimately done with both humor and passion . but the viewer , unable to know more than the little he sees about them , can only guess at what draws them so close . the story played more like a gimmick than a real love affair , because after their initial encounters , it seemed rather strange that these intelligent people wouldn't be curious to know more about each other , especially since they were developing a certain bond together . yet , on the other hand , the reason this film worked so well , was the illuminated performance by baye , who was 50 at the time of the film , but looks much younger and has such a touching quality about her , that she is simply ravishing . and if you add to that the mature script by french novelist and playwright philippe blasband and the classy way frederic fonteyne directed , it is easy to see why the film was so enthralling . what you get is an affair that turns out to be in surprisingly good taste , but without satisfying the more mundane matters in a relationship . it was as if this was a sex lab experiment , an ideal couple was being tested to see if a purely sexual encounter could spark a more intimate relationship . if the film moved off its experimental mode and let us see the couple act away from the controlled ground rule conditions , this might have been an even much better film . the film was originally titled "" une liaison pornographique . "" it won for best film at venice . "
880,"a poignant , original , psychological drama-comedy depicting life among a bunch of disorientated residents in vancouver . his schoolwork also suffers because of his deep sexual problem . he makes good use of leigh's improvisational way of shooting a film and has created a nifty contemporary film , with frighteningly real sex scenes and recognizable characters who have modern urban problems . the acting is subtle ( babz chula's performance is mesmorizing ) , while , the story , though not reliant on plot , is emotionally strong , showing how all the individuals are tangled up in knots . it was both a sad and funny picture , one that i would highly recommend for those who are not afraid of seeing some very graphic , 'dirty' sexual scenes , that fit the story to a tee . "
881,"there is a fatalistic feel about their lives , something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat . mitchum gives this film all the intensity and purpose it needs , as it overcomes a thin plot . it makes you see the characters for what they are without any false sympathy for them . "
882,"this film offers a literate script and is sensitively directed , it's a brilliant debut as a director for playwright kenneth lonergan ( co-scripted "" analyze this ! "" ) . besides writing the screenplay and directing it , he also has a minor part in the film as a religious counselor . it is so well-conceived a work that it never feels stagy , as many other films of this type tend to be . the film was a co-winner of this year's sundance grand jury prize and recipient of the waldo salt screenwriting award . the siblings have different personalities and have gone down different roads , and even though there is a strong bond between them , what this restaurant meeting highlights is how different they also are , as this scene brilliantly sets the tense tone for the remainder of the film . the sheer beauty in the film is in the natural bonding that develops between the curiously bright but lonely rudy and the irresponsible terry . the bad decisions terry makes are not selfish ones , but are the one's he makes because he means well but doesn't always know how to do the right thing . sammy and rudy touch something about themselves in terry's short summertime visit , something they wouldn't have touched that was so real without terry being there as a catalyst for change . this subtle drama is satisfying in almost every respect , but mainly as a realistic presentation of working-class characters who are struggling with the mundane problems of everyday existence . this is a superbly acted and subtle work , whose only flaws are in the unbelievable romance between boss and worker and the artificial lovemaking depicted between sammy and her townie boyfriend , both of which had no ring of truth to it . but , otherwise , this is one of the best films of 2000 , and indie type of art film with an intensity and a strong sense of realistic dramatics that brings out the complex emotional problems of the main characters . "
883,"art biopics are rarely successful ventures but this film approaches those high caliber art films , such as jacques rivette's la belle noiseuse and paul cox's vincent : the life and death of vincent van gogh , but falls short by a good country mile due to the film's inability to get a handle on how to tell about the taciturn artist's inner demons in a significant way rather than in the traditional bleak and trite way hollywood films usually illustrate an artist's failings . the strength of the film is in the tour de force performances of both ed harris as the action painter pollock , a role that he is well-suited to play , and marcia gay harden's understated but brilliant performance as his brooklyn-born wife and main supporter , lee krasner . she won the oscar for best supporting actress , in a lengthy role where she was actually the co-star . but this is ed harris's film , a film he wanted to do as long as 15 years ago after reading a book about pollock and noticing from a photo how closely he resembled him and how he had a certain vibe for him . he not only directs and stars in the film , but he financed it . these scenes were brilliantly executed by harris and made the film a labor of love for him . harris was absolutely convincing playing the artist , he looked as if he was a real artist at work . pollock is not an overwhelming film , as much as it is a superbly well acted one . it shows how pollock found freedom only when he painted , as his outside life was that of a flawed man , a very difficult man to get along with , who didn't have much to say about art or life that was particularly interesting . harris as a director , had a love affair with the artist that was much too respectful to get beyond what we already know about him . he was someone who lived out the artist fantasy trip by achieving more in style than in substance , even though the film wants us to believe he was truly a great artist . "
884,"the action takes place offscreen . some viwers might consider niagara more of a steamy melodrama than a noir , but it does have all the dark ingredients fitting a noir film , whereby an innocent is overtaken by a lust that consumes him , while the femme fatale is a heartless schemer with a large sexual appetite . this was marilyn monroe's first starring role , after having been in already eighteen other films , but mostly in small roles . director hathaway does a nice job of crafting the film and exploiting its colorful location , but what he doesn't do that well , is allow the mystery part of the story to gracefully unfold . the last reel plays like an action film , with a strangulation , a kidnapping , a helicopter rescue , and one character doomed to be going over the falls . in contrast to the loomis' , the cutler's are seen as being a conventional couple , and the camera seems to be gently eyeballing them and showing that their sex life is calmer and more suited for a positive and loving relationship than the loomis' . yet the normal couple is attracted to the more exotic one , especially polly , through whose eyes the film is filtered out to us . "
885,"an amusing and sophisticated espionage thriller , only slightly flawed by some of its contrivances . he's a disgraced m . i . -6 but andy is a go-getter , a schemer and an opportunist without scruples . geoffrey rush is the timid man trapped in the post-noriega panamanian intrigues , and pierce brosnan is the seducer without morals . they play one another off in a most refreshingly joyous way , as for a while is hard to tell who has the upper hand . under john boorman's ( deliverance/hope and glory ) competent direction , the film has air to breathe for its smart storytelling tale and parody . the joke is how readily the americans buy into this unreliable info without thoroughly checking it out , and how this quickly turns into an international disagreement between panama and the u . s . . this farce works out fairly well . the script is tight . the directing is impeccable , the acting finely tuned , and the mood it sets is for a thinking man's picture to develop amidst all the comedy . the digs i liked best were : 'you know what the poor call those ? ' launderettes ! ' this is not an ordinary commercial formula film , but it's more like harry's handmade suits rather than those suits bought off the rack . "
886,"this wonderful documentary on the life of ramblin' jack elliott won the special jury award for artistic achievement at the 2000 sundance film festival . the film's other aim is a loving tribute to his musical accomplishments and his troubadour lifestyle of never settling down . she complains : "" the thing is , i can't remember having an actual conversation with my dad . "" "
887,"it is adapted from herman melville's 1852 novel pierre ( pola is the acronym of the french title of melville's novel , x stands for the tenth draft of the screenplay which writer/director leos carax completed ) . it is a film about madness and excesses , topics that are always fuzzy to portray on the screen . it's set in modern france though it starts out looking like a romantic 19th century literary work , where its background is a rich , idyllic country setting in normandy of palatial chateaus void of modern traffic . we know it's modern times only because the protagonist rides a motorcycle and uses a computer . this is a unique film , that has an inexplicable brilliance to it that defies reason and its soap opera melodramatics . it is precious film , though parts of it may not be pleasing or deciferable . but there is an intelligence it has about it that should overcome all doubts about its excesses : as the film goes from showing pierre's change from being a self-indulgent aristocrat to his complete breakdown as a self-indulgent raving lunatic . "
888,"this story is very colorfully photographed and has very little dialogue . the final story is surreal and is very comical . marzieh meshkini is the wife of noted iranian film director mohsen makhmalbaf . he served as the film's screenwriter . even though they are different women depicted , it might as well be the same woman because the film is a metaphor for all iranian women . strangely enough , the iranian censors wanted the director to cut this part because they found it too erotic . we know exactly how she feels and how determined she is not to be bullied by them , as we clearly see her animated facial expressions . in any case , it is evident from this episode that a divorce can be attained quite easily by a man . this is an irresistible film . i ate it up as quickly as i used to lick an ice cream cone when i was a kid . you can learn more about iran from watching a movie like this one than you can by following the news stories reported by the media . "
889,"they keep the viewer riveted to the twists in plot as one's perceptions about the case are subject to change , in this excellently conceived australian psychological thriller . what is the truth can only be surmised by the film's end , but enough is revealed so that you think you know the answer . though the film might not be startling or flamboyant it is competently acted , especially by the two main antagonists , hugo weaving and tony martin . it is chillingly photographed by simon duggan , giving it a retro-noir film look .

890,"love's a bitch is an intricate film noir tale , living up to its tough sounding title . it's a melodrama about violence and passion in a contemporary mexican city . this compelling , lengthy ( 153 minutes ) drama is alejandro gonz ? lez i ? ? rritu's auspicious directorial debut . the lost dog sequence seemed too forced and heavy-handed to have much impact ; it was piling up the material girl's misery much too high . there's passion and excellent filmmaking and acting in these gritty stories , but there's also too much of a story going on ; and , it is too long of a film . but it is intoxicating in its edginess and harsh look at reality , and at one's dreams and obsessions . i ? ? rritu's characters are full of life and earthy flaws , and things that are too much for them to comprehend . an excellent debut film for the director , that touches in an original way on themes many other innovative indie directors ( especially quentin tarantino's pulp fiction ) are currently doing . "
891,"a visually playful version of marcel proust's epic "" remembrance of things past , "" which only covers the last volume of a lengthy multi-volume book ; but , continually makes references to other parts of the book not covered in the film . the film is almost incomprehensible without reading the book , as there's no time to introduce all of the story line and characters ( though an attempt was made to introduce the main characters , as the dying proust puts a magnifying glass to the photos in his collection that bring back his memories ) ; for those who are not readers of the book this is not a substitute for the book , but a work that , nevertheless , lives on its own merits . to expect anything to be less than opaque from an undertaking of such a difficult work to adapt to the screen is , perhaps , asking too much of anyone . in a ruiz film one must expect a work that is obscure and mysterious . that this combination avant garde art film and literary period drama is successful in its bold attempt to go where most other filmmakers fear to go , into the labyrinthian world of proust's dying era during the early part of the 20th century and to come away with a work of such dreamlike beauty , is simply an amazing feat . it's a film that doesn't necessarily tell a story , but brings you instead to the conclusion of "" remembrance of things past "" in an unforgettably eccentric way . in this dying atmosphere marcel will revisit his past , as the film is not linear so we will see him as he was throughout his life -- from a youngster to middle-aged to his present condition -- at any time during the film . the film is made up of a succession of formal social gatherings in palatial homes through which finely dressed women gossip wearing either brocades or fashionable feathers sticking out of their hair ; while the formally dressed men parade around in the ballroom with the look of contented bulls ; the film's most artistic image is of the men's upturned top hats covering the floor of an ornate waiting room . we are treated to funerals as spectacles that look oddly enough like convivial affairs . madame verdurin's companion replies : "" but you're wrong , odette looks ravashing . "" the film is loaded with surprises , as ruiz uses proust in the film to meditate on how he would have used the film if he were to film his epic instead of write it . there are all sorts of camera tricks used : shots frozen in time , imitations of how the filmmakers of that time period shot their films , and the past and present fuse sometimes together in a surrealistic way . it's an ambitious project , enhanced by its starry cast , filled with splendid visuals and tidbits from conversations that don't linger long , as the film moves intractably into the poetical . it's proust you're getting , but from a daring perspective . this is not a film to see only once . it is also a rare film , that shouldn't be missed , even if it's messy and one is apt to get lost in its decadent mood swings and enthralling aristocratic atmosphere . the film just feels right for either the reader of the novel as i was some 30 years ago who was trying to recall what i could from the book as i watched , or the novice to proust who might just be entertained by what he or she sees on the screen . there are some who claim that this is the best written novel of the 20th century , and it very well might be ! this film works , despite being able to only capture the book in spirit but not in its whole . but there is no doubt about one thing , this is what good filmmaking is about ! "
892,"it traces in particular the aspects of women's work and their servitude that covers a 10-year period - from 1951 to 1961 . it is seen through the eyes of mui . because of this the young child tin , in particular , acts unruly , taking it out mostly on mui . the second part of the film pales in comparison to part one , and that is because the innocent mui as a child was the glue that held the film together and made it seem so special . the older mui doesn't radiate the same warmth on the screen . this is a very pleasing and subtle tale about the strength of the human spirit and the artistic quietude one has when finding peace within one's self . it is about a traditional culture that is no longer common , if it exists at all , since the vietnam war . a terrific film , one of tremendous visual beauty , but one that steers clear of any overt political messages . at cannes , it was named the best film by a first-time director . it also received a nomination for best foreign film at the oscars . "
893,"it's a metaphysical love story with a bit of mystery thrown in . there's also more than a bit of a political allegory to it that holds the film together in an intelligent way , as both of the main characters are motivated by political concerns . the love story is complex and is the heart of this engrossing film , a film that deals with the ambiguities that propel people to be who they are . it's a relationship filled with all sorts of possible pitfalls . billy crudup plays the wheedling fielding pierce who's stuck in an empty world of deceit , in a political role much like the robert redford character in the candidate . in fielding's case he never shows that he's even a liberal , only that he's blinded by an urge to achieve success . he will never be quite sure if what he envisioned was real or a figment of his desires , but his sanity at this point is certainly questionable . she states : "" i want a life that makes sense . "" i don't really know how great this film is , but it did catch my attention ; especially , the way gordon was able to get his main characters to act out who they were and struggle to make their life and their love viable , despite the different directions they would have to go to get where they wanted to be . there was something soap opera like about this tragic love affair that was not only baffling but sad , yet it was more dramatic than that . we weren't overwhelmed by them as stereotypes , forced into accepting them . i think how we accepted them really relates to our life experiences . i know i felt very comfortable with jennifer connelly's performance ; i thought it was subtle , soft-spoken , and unforgettably powerful . it was easy for me to relate to her and what she was about without feeling i was presented with a character who was being foisted on me in a "" love story "" tear-jerker way . the film was passionate , intelligent , and real . the jennifer connelly character is really the subject of the film and her spirit fills the screen whether she's on it or not . this is because she came across as someone with a real heart and is always haunting us throughout the film because we care about her . we don't really care about him . the two actors were just terrific , giving the story its potency and purpose . "
894,"it's an homage to robert altman's insightful film , with the same theme , "" mccabe and mrs . miller . "" they have come here to confront mr . dillon in a way that will not call attention to others why they are here . dalglish is the young scottish version of dillon . it all indicates that even though he's honestly doing his job , he seems to be someone who has chinks in his armor and might in the future be more easily corrupted . the claim works best as an antitraditional western epic that presents an allegorical drama of fate , retribution and redemption . it took a certain courage for dillon , the flawed hero of the story , to come out to this barren land and make something out of it . the next generation to come out here was represented by the brashness of young dalglish , who will have it easier than the pioneers . he will have more to work with , but the baton has been passed on and he will also have to face his dark side and see if he can overcome his mistakes and build something that is worthwhile and lasting . the film might not have been engaging dramatically at all times , as it parcelled out its long tale reluctantly in bits and pieces , but it sets a haunting mood relating the lives of these laconic characters to the building of the country . the film is satisfying because it remains elusive as to what the ingredient for success and happiness is , as each character wants something else in their american dream . this is a country where individual freedom is cherished , and this film does that concept a great honor by not trivializing that dream to be the same for everyone . there are a number of striking visual scenes ; such as , the train passing through the breathtaking mountain landscape , which indicates what a difficult chore it must have been to lay tracks in that location . the scottish actor peter mullen gave a wonderfully restrained performance , convincing as the man who did wrong and doesn't know how to make things right except by trying to when given a second chance . there's a gloomy ending that reflects on how disasterous and empty a life of greed is . it's a bleak film that manages to give one hope for a situation that seems hopeless , and that is the strength of this very enriching film . it has captured a slice of the american west from a book that was written as an english period piece . "
895,"here jaoui takes on the directing duties as well . the charm in this plot less film is that everyone presented is so much different in lifestyle and yet with all their flaws and differences , they all have something going for them that might be appealing to someone else . the story allows us to see each of their points of view clearly as their character is fully developed ; it is so smartly and subtly done without patting itself on the back , that it becomes a pleasure to watch such an intelligent presentation on the problems of love and of one developing taste . and , isn't life all about developing taste and evolving ! the more limited one is , the more limited one's friendships and love will be ! the performers all do a marvelous job of getting this across and they make the film a joy to see . it's thankfully a film that has a life of its own and shuns any formulaic way of resolving this tale , which should only disappoint zombie viewers of familiar hollywood love stories . "
896,"stanley kubrick until his untimely death was working on a project that weighed for a long time on his mind -- the subject of artificial intelligence . steven spielberg is given the blessing by the kubrick estate to take over that project , and he brings his great craftsmanship skill as a visual story teller to the film while paying homage to kubrick's intentions and themes he wanted developed . he succeeds for most of the film in keeping it tight while presenting an occasional riveting psychological moment or two , as he tells a fairy tale for adults ; it's a version which will go way over the heads of children and many of the adults . what he does is put the pinocchio fairy tale , the frankenstein story , and the oedipus myth in his warm-hearted blender and gives them a good mixing up . he also takes full credit for the script and does not include kubrick as co-screenwriter ; he only credits him with the film's idea . what spielberg fails to do is tell the fairy tale ending in the same artistic way a kubrick would have displayed his mastery of telling a good mystery story . it was a thoughtful climactic touch but what the film demanded for it to be considered as a masterpiece , is a more lyrical note to end it on ; which is the most glaring fault of the film . what spielberg delivers is a film that leaves you thinking about what the end of human civilization means and how close to artificial intelligence can the world be as its reality , and about how love is something that can't be programmed without something being amiss about it . it also does not have spielberg's usual dosage of sentimentality , which has played havoc with most of his previous films . it's a splendid film that pays homage to both himself and kubrick for their noteworthy films . t . . it's a hollywood film that defies what a hollywood film is about , while in essence still being a hollywood film of excesses and special effects . this is one of the best films spielberg has ever made , and his most thought-provoking one . it has much of both giant filmmakers locked into this story , though it's a spielberg film and not a kubrick one . a . i . is set in the near-future , mid-21st century , as narrator ben kingsley explains that the melted ice caps are a common sight . the sight of nyc submerged under the ocean is both bleak and visually satisfying . what is hinted at , is that we are just beginning to see what the possibilities there are in a . i . . but in order for the robots to have a live intelligence and not merely a programmed one , they will have to be created like nature creates its plants and animals . it is this possibility that will always leave them flawed , but with the potential to push evolution to new levels . the second half of the story becomes layered with more complex themes and harder to answer questions . it's a spiritual odyssey about creation that david takes in the hardened nocturnal world of what remains of urban civilization , which is a reflection of a literary hell . it's here that spielberg asks questions about humanity that he has never asked before in his more lightweight films : he questions family values and wonders about scientific and religious definitions of creation , and he most of all wonders if humanity is only one link in evolution that raises consciousness and that if it becomes obsolete what will be the other ways to evolve . it's an imaginative film , that has a lot going for it except exciting dialogue . i couldn't ask for anything more from spielberg ; he has taken on kubrick's depth and artistic integrity in filmmaking , at least , for this film ; he has paid homage to kubrick , and has made a highly personal film . this might disappoint many in the mass market audience that are attracted to spielberg for other reasons and might expect to see another kiddie pic like e . t . . but the film will also attract a more sophisticated sci-fi film crowd , that should connect this film with a "" 2001 "" cyberspace experience . "
897,"a brilliantly stylized period piece set in kyoto in 1865 , during the final days of the samurais . it's written and directed by the great japanese filmmaker , nagisa oshima ( in the realm of the senses/empire of passion/merry christmas , mr . lawrence ) . taboo has a dreamlike quality to it that is spellbinding as it creates an eerie blue mood and makes the characters glow with a haunting feeling that this tale is taking place in the afterworld . kano is very appealing because of his boyish locks of hair and sensual and regal mannerisms , and his great ability as a warrior ; his stunning looks attracts everyone's attention . the film is an ambiguous one . its look at homosexuality is also a look at how others look at it , and what we know about that is seen in the expressions made . the film ends without a clarity to what kano or the commanders were going through internally . it's the closest we might come to decifering what all the ambiguity meant , as each one's perception might differ as to what beauty is and what price they are willing to pay for it . a thoroughly maddening work from arguably japan's best living director . "
898,"this is a film where the heroine could say with deep conviction that "" i've seen bodies shining like stars , "" and we believe her without laughing at her . it's an unusual and fascinatingly compelling fairy tale type of drama , steeped in feeling and intellect and romance . "" kissed "" is based on the original story by barbara gowdy "" we so seldom look on love , "" and directed with economy in her first feature by canadian lynne stopkewich . what makes this film standout , is that the subject matter is necrophilia . this is never followed up . but for sandra the dead bodies are a means of transcendence . . . the reason it's a detriment , is because her story is more dynamic and compelling than his . one of the really amazing things about ths film is that it's all believable . it's handled in a romantic and even comical way , allowing us to see the characters for what they are instead of sensationalizing their fetishes . there were three very good performances : jay brazeau sets a sobering tone for the story to be grounded in reality , no matter how far-fetched it may seem . peter outerbridge brings a sensitivity and restlessness to his role , as someone whose curiosity is so great that he's willing to try something that is ghoulish . but the film belongs to molly parker's absorbing translation of her role , as an ordinary person who is compelled to do what she feels most pressing inside her . the film comes with voice-overs from molly , in her quiet , gentle voice , and the photography at times becomes glowing in a heavenly whiteness or darkly pressing in a sobering blue shade . the film always felt dreamlike , like it was a fairy tale without a moral lesson to it . the film's only fault is in how slight the story is and how it failed to go beyond the shocking taboo point of its "" crossing over "" theme and really explore that untested subject matter in more depth . but the film is still a special one because of the freshness of its ideas , the originality of the film's theme , and the way it was so artfully filmed . "
899,"it's a "" message "" film with "" message songs "" playing in the background , as its ultimate message is that it is better to live in peace and make the world a better place to live in then to blindly obey authority figures . the film's other aim is to show the lost dreams and violence that fills america's wastelands and wounds those living there . the main rivals of the cops are the hippies , as a clash over culture and values exists . the film is quirky , atmospheric , interesting in its character study , and is successful as a black comedy . it's main flaw is that its messages are too simplistic and the story suffers , at times , from a heavy-handed direction . the film has plenty of action scenes , culminating with a motorcycle chase ; a good twist in the murder mystery story ; and , what it does best is show how lonely people could be and how this is sometimes the driving force behind the false lives they lead . "
900,"an auspicious debut for director joel coen and for the coen brothers as a writer and director team , as this film noir is delightfully thrilling . blood simple is highlighted by an absolutely wonderous performance that is both sleazy and diabolical by m . emmet walsh . made on a shoestring budget , the film sparkles because its characters are lively and quirky . i saw it on a recently digitally-remastered video version where the director cut off a few minutes of unnecessary dialogue . "
901,"as a misleading clue , one page of the diary is left on the floor . "
902,"it turns out that she didn't murder anyone , it was all the theater group's idea of testing out her skills as an actress in this real-life audition to see if she would get the part . it makes for a rousing climax , as karlson is good at doing the revenge thing in a crisp and rugged way . it's an absorbing film that holds your interest as it explores the life of people in the ring . it also covers the usual criminal types in a typical noirish way . it throws enough light and ideas around to make this a compelling film , better than your average film noir . its stylized violence and passion from the characters were both unreal and real , as the desperate characters grappled with the truth of their lives . "
903,"the film was superbly shot in b & w by john alton in a semidocumentary style . it's a solid film noir effort , which was also able to get in some comments on social consciousness between the ethnic montalban and the snobbish bias the elitist edmon ryan portrayed . "
904,"as is obviously intended , two can play that game is sure to hit big with the african american audience , but it should also be treasured as a great date movie for the moviegoing public at large . it's got the kind of friskiness that makes you exchange glances with the stranger seated next to you because both of you know how many things it gets right about relationships . with as many twists and turns as this romantic comedy takes , you're sure to have a good time . still , while the production contains all the correct ingredients , it uses them in the wrong recipe . it hits a humorous bulls-eye with plenty of cultural issues , but it lacks the very substance it's made of : true love . the film , written and directed by mark brown , makes a common hollywood mistake of confusing sexuality with true passion . not that this destroys the film ; in fact , for an r-rated sex comedy , this is very tame material . this production takes risks , but for a movie that concerns itself so much with romance , it just doesn't get any of that across convincingly . with frequent soliloquies , intrusive narration , and a central character that very much takes center stage , shante does not just narrate the film , she explains it . seldom do filmmakers gamble their success on such an unusual style , but the conceit gives the movie a sense of independence , attitude , and a unique , experimental flavor . fox's performance keeps energy alive , even when she knows her mouth is running a little too much . it's surprisingly entertaining . alas , the film does not really earn its ending . it doesn't persuasively prove the characters' sudden realizations . two can play that game is still light-hearted and fluffy . it exists solely to please the audience , but it also works as a social commentary . rating : * * * * |------------------------------| \ * * * * * perfection \ \ * * * * good , memorable film \ \ * * * average , hits and misses \ \ * * sub-par on many levels \ \ * unquestionably awful \ |------------------------------| "
905,"an exciting film noir robbery escapade set in la , one that set the standard for such films . director richard fleischer shot the film in a taut manner , while the photographs of the dark la locale added grit to the film . "
906,"it plays out as a horror comedy low-budget b-film that is a parody of the hip art world and those who seek fame . its satire cuts deeper into this bohemian world than most other films . walter is discovered by leonard as a murderer , but since collectors are willing to pay big bucks for such detailed realistic work--he doesn't tell the cops . charles b . griffith provides the film with a witty script . character actor dick miller gives an impressionable performance , as does his romantic interest barboura morris . it's a bloody black comedy that is gruesomely funny and because of its unsophisticated way of probing into the underground art world--it exudes a radiant charm , a true cult film delight from the 1950s made for all eras . "
907,"black angel is a film noir armed with the following : a brilliant script by roy chanslor that is taken from a cornell woolrich novel , an engaging performance turned in by dan duryea who is in a rare role as someone sympathetic , and it is directed flawlessly with craft-like skills by roy william neill . this was duryea's first starring role after playing heavies . the film asks the question : is he a hero or a villain ? but he swears he didn't do it . the low-budget film had a stunning simplicity to it that evoked all kinds of feelings for the players involved in this imaginative story and dramatic tragedy . the film also presented an excellent character study of the dan duryea character , making him into a complicated black angel figure . "
908,"a thoroughly delightful documentary by allan miller ( small wonders ) about the putting on of puccini's turandot opera . the china production features 900 hand-embroided costumes , made by 2 , 000 workers , that are authentic from the ming period . as an aside , we are told the soldiers thought the opera music at first sounded like mooing cows , but later on they began to enjoy it even humming some of the tunes . but the opera works as does the documentary , which is more about the intricacies of staging it then it is about the opera itself . the film could appeal to opera buffs as well as to those who never saw an opera , as it passionately shows the clashes of culture between the east and the west and differences about artistic ideas among the crew more than it does anything else . this seems to blend in perfectly with the opera being staged , which is also overblown with passion . "" authenticity "" is what makes zubin jump with rosy delight as his sense of artistic merit is realized by his moves to keep the production as a collaboration that is an international effort . he is most proud that it is being shown for the first time in beijing , the place the opera was originally set in . but zhang yimou looks sullen throughout , with a constant worry that something will go wrong in this unwieldy production and it will embarrass the chinese people . there's a for real clash with the italian director of opera lighting , guido levi , over the intensity of the light , which adds zest to the film . zhang , always the perfectionist , wants the bright lights to match those of the bright costumes , but only gets grief from the self-important italian . at one point zhang gives a coaches's football-like inspirational talk to some crew members saying : that he accepted the project "" to win credit for the chinese , "" and expects them to do well . it was also amusing to watch the overweight diva sharon sweet go into a snit about not wearing a tiny headdress because it made her look ugly . if not solved , the man is beheaded . there's some pieces of opera music played which were very pleasing ( such as the aria 'nessun dorma' ) . also interesting were the shots contrasting the opera setting in the ming dynasty with the routine life in modern beijing and its new hi-risers , and its citizens craving for consumer goods such as cell phones and tv's as they seem to be embarked on building a totalitarian style materialistic society . it was troubling not knowing anything about those tailors brought in to make the costumes--were they slave laborers ? nevertheless , it was amusing to learn of the differences of watching an opera in the west and in china . in the west , opera is treated as a very serious work and the theater remains quiet during the performance . mainly this is a film about what goes on backstage when you put on an opera , and that in itself was a treat to see . yet i didn't find these unpleasant incidentals damaging enough to interfere with zubin's aim to celebrate the different cultures by putting on this opera in beijing . zubin and miller had a different agenda than either the communist regime or for that matter zhang , and if the gap could be bridged through music that would be of benefit to world peace . "
909,"a triumph of quirkiness over a hackneyed western story to make it a very appealing film that varies slightly from the genre . it was one of the best low-budget westerns that the noted director joseph h . lewis made in his long and distinguished career , as he chose to retire from the film industry with this film . there was some controversy surrounding this film as it was probably not good for anyone's career to appear in it , as many in the production were either blacklisted or were subpoenaed to appear before the house of un-american activities committee . it was skillfully made , had style and the expressions of an auteur filmmaker to make it standout from other westerns .

910,"luther robinson ) ; runtime : 95 ; fine line features ; 2000 ) it was produced on the low-budget of $6 million . if you don't think that was low , then compare it with this year's other musical "" moulin rouge "" and its $50 million budget . it was a poetically touching film , one that was more complex than what might have been thought from a work that calls itself a "" post-punk , neo-glam rock musical . "" the song becomes hedwig's rather unique theory of the evolution of human sexuality from a transsexual perspective . you can take it or leave it , but there it is to be heard as the cry of one voice telling of his own madness . i thought it was wonderfully vibrant , a chance to know about someone most of us will never meet either in life or through other films . an example of the lyrics he treats them to is "" i rose from off of the doctor's slab/like lazarus from the pit/now everyone wants to take a stab/and desecrate me with blood , graffiti and spit . "" this is the artful and alluring mr . mitchell's film all the way , as he puts his heart and soul into it both as a singer and an actor . he also wrote the screenplay and made his debut as a director . his rich voice sounds like david bowie' , using the songs written by stephen trask to fill the screen with a parody of bowie's ziggy stardust . he also struts across the stage as a super-star would , dons a multitude of wigs , lovingly shows off gams that are the equal of betty grable's , and captures our attention with his sad and meaningful story . it's one that calls out for tolerance in a spirited way , as it transcends pop culture and touches on the search the young have to find something in this world to believe in . this is something the film touched on in its teasing way , giving us something to chew over in this unusual tale . the film was both amateurish and glossy in a professional sense , and whatever it did--worked ; even using many gimmicky filmmaking techniques - including the stunningly gorgeous animated pieces by award-winning artist emily hubley . this is the best transvestite rock musical ever ( it got right both the music and the emotional impact of the pain suffered by the star ) , and it is at least better by an inch than its only other cult film rival "" the rocky horror picture show . "" though the latter will in all probability still be more popular with a wider audience . "
911,"the film paints a grim picture of his family , though it's certainly not the worst family to raise kids . this impressive debut film is visually very powerful , it has plenty of images to relate to what's burning inside james . this audacious film seems like a nightmare , or a dream that james can't wake up from . the result is a lyrical work that has a numbing affect because of its sparseness and tight images ; it's a film of high quality .

912,"if you've seen max oph ? ls' reckless moment ( 49 ) , you've seen this film . it's the same story but updated to fit modern times . my take on remakes is--if it was a great film , as the 1940s noir film was , why make another ! but , at least , this version is as good . both matriarchs give oscar quality performances , in a film that is based on the novel by elizabeth sanxay holding called "" the blank wall "" and directed by the team who did suture--david siegel & scott mcgehee . it didn't convince me in the older version , nor does it in the newer ; but swinton as the perfect mom is convincing , as we see the determination and pain in her face as it is drawn tight in gaunt looks out at the world that has turned hostile for her . it's a moving but restraint performance and gives the art-house thriller some depth .

913,"les biches ( the does ) ( director : claude chabrol ; cast : jean-louis trintignant ( paul thomas ) , jacqueline sassard ( why ) , st ? phane audran ( fr ? d ? rique ) , henri attal ( rob ? que ) , dominique zardi ( riais ) , 1968-france ) this is top notch filmmaking by a director who when he is on the mark is as good as anyone in the business . the film is divided into a number of segments that ask questions about the lead characters , questions they cannot readily ask about themselves . that chabrol has the audacity to weave a story around these three diverse characters , each searching for something inside them that remains a mystery to them , plays well against the unmitigated sexual yearnings and need to experience sex these three have in common . it is a way to look at the 1960s , that is through the lenses of these materialists , who seemed to shun that period's more typical cultural revolution . by all indications , they could care less about art or the world . why knows she is not a good artist , and fr ? d ? rique could care less . though the sex is not explicit , its tenseness is what is felt as an obsession , as fr ? d ? rique and paul feel a happiness in their love that fills a void in their life that they couldn't find before . what makes this one of chabrol's better films , is the unexpected resources of the characters to pull off this emotionally draining story : the females , the very fragile does of the film , and the male , who is the hunter , wrestle with the ambiguities of their sexual intentions and inclinations , as it leads up to the tragic ending . their emotionally desperate situation always seems to be one step beyond their reach , as they get deeper and deeper into an unresolvable situation , with the film ending on its bleakest note , with a certain amount of vagueness still remaining , that is befitting a film that has told its story with all the style and clarity it could muster . dennis schwartz : movie reviews ozus @sover . net "
914,"can you imagine that this innovative , creative film , a groundbreaker for its time , managed to virtually end the career of its great and noted director , as the subject's sexual content was too much to take for so many of the self-righteous critics of that time ! this is a film about scoptophilia ( voyeurism ) : the morbid urge to gaze , or as it is more commonly called , being a peeping tom . this fascinating film is as intensely good as any thriller done by hitchcock or chabrol . its intensity and compelling characterization of mark , is a landmark in films .

915,"that ahmed goes on to the next village , despite warnings of not to go , is a metaphor for how a childlike curiousity and a refreshing innocense is the essential ingredient needed , if change is ever to come to a society that is stagnant . the narrowness of life and the barren landscape , are excellent props for the director's vibrant themes , shot without professional actors and done in a low key , realistic style . the aims of this film are set too low to make it a masterpiece , especially when you compare it to a satyajit ray film , but this is still great cinema , something american filmmakers would be wise to observe . his relentless pursuit is poetically evocative , depicting life in its raw elements . what more can you ask for ?

916,"this extra-ordinary film offers a long hard look at its subject matter , as the camera is held steadfast , not moving for insatiably long periods of time , picking up all the appropriate nuances it needs to with deliberate dispassion , as it looks at an oregon lumber mill , whose owner ( tom blair ) is faced with unsettling economic news about the business he has built-up and worked at for his 50- odd years of life . by seeing who this man is , we get to see how he adjusts to his carefully scripted life , the fly-fishing he loves to do for the sport of it , his easy and almost gentile manners , and his very definite american persona , as he is forced out of economic necessity to deal with the japanese businessmen he inherently despises , and we get a picture of a rather complicated individual , who has difficulty in communicating with himself and others , so the closer we get to him , the more we sense that there are a lot of things about him that remain unanswered . this scene could also be deemed as an attack on america's soul , exposing it to questions about truth and character , principles that are put under the microscope , as the story builds to its very tragic outcome . this is one of jost's deepest and most penetrating films , it could even be argued that he has made a classical film , as it forcefully and subtly tells an american story , replete with unanswered questions about family life that are haunting , that give the film a certain power that makes you think for a long time afterwards what is it about this country that is so raw and violent in nature , that becomes a part of the people's own nature . one of the scenes that i found most memorable , was when the camera panned the diner where tom was dining with some co-workers and all we could hear , at first , was the muffled conversations of the patrons , as the camera meticulously panned the diner , until the atmosphere of the place was fully absorbed and we returned to tom and his conversation , which became clearer , as this scene played out a daily experience most americans have had but has rarely been captured so exactly on film . this time consuming shot , is not attempted by commercial filmmakers who live in fear of losing their audience in a long non-action shot . this is one of jost's strong points , his willingness to explore territory others fear to go . jost's film can be justifiably criticized for a few lapses in the story line it didn't clarify more precisely , but more importantly , it should be praised for the poetry it brings to its story when telling about a malaise in the american culture that is difficult to come to grips with , as the american landscape is perceived as so beautiful a sight to behold and the country as so wealthy a place when compared with the rest of the world , as it asks . . . but , what does this mean if americans are not a happy people ? "
917,"he did not like the service , saying he saw many terrible things there , so many dead people as a result of war , even though he was only a butcher there , it had an awful affect on him . this does not disturb our butcher , who comes by the school offering helene a leg of lamb as if it were a bouquet . the most memorable scene in the film , is when the children are on an outing in the woods and one of the girls is about to bite into her roll , when a red spot appears on it , looking like jam . that she doesn't say anything , but continues seeing popaul strikes me as odd . but this is what adds to the flavor of this methodically simple story . the flawed characters are what elevate this film into something other than a straight mystery story , because getting the murderer is not the theme of the film , as much as trying to understand something that is complex about human nature . it is hard to figure what is happening internally in the budding relationship between popaul and helene , but it is definetly not a sexual one . that was pretty much the theme chabrol used in his first film , shot 10 years before this one , le beau serge , which also took place in a rural village . but this time , the theme is more fully developed by a director who has greatly matured . this is chabrol at his best , equal to hitchcock . spinning an eerie psychological thriller , whose likable characters and the nostalgic village they live in , are painted with a master's elegant brushstrokes . it seems films such as this one , never get dated . it gets better every time i see it . this time i was better able to notice the serene landscape in the background , the magnificent limestone caves , and the casual manner village life went on , giving this film a very natural atmosphere . as a result , this is a very satisfying film . "
918,"something went terribly wrong and either party doesn't know what else to do . ian is very intense , almost over the edge , but he makes sense to these victims , and he requires no payment if he loses the case , but will be getting 1/3 of the settlement if he wins . this all adds up to a brilliant film . one of the best of the recent lawyer genre films now being made ( it is the best one i have seen ) , and the only reason it is not a masterpiece , in my opinion , is because it was too real , something metaphorical about it was lacking ; i went away from the film intellectually gratified , but did not feel the film opened up the emotional wounds of the locals whereas they would see anything more about the tragedy than the fact that their lives had been changed ; even if , some of the locals now question their motives to retain a lawyer , and that is now questioned in a way that it has never been questioned before . i have no problem with that aspect of the film , that was convincingly conveyed to me ; as was , the lawyer's motives , who comes across to us as not a good or an evil man , he is a man driven and ripped apart by guilt , even to the point of exhibiting bizarre behavior , as he searches to find a meaning for his life that he doesn't quite understand anymore , which is apparently more true than his belief that he is so committed to his work because he is trying to find justice for his clients ; so what we have , what remains for us to ponder , is the fact that nothing is as simple as the accident is ; everyone's life has been changed and nothing is the same anymore . but the question that still remains , is what has anyone learned from this , and that is left lingering because there is an emotional disconnect inbred in the story , when all is said and done , and we don't know for sure if anything was learned . nevertheless , atom egoyan has created a splendid artistic film . "
919,"having lived through and somehow survived the cultural revolutions of the late 60s and early 70s american style , not fully aware of what the french upheaval was all about , except to notice that there was more of an identification over there between the working-class and intellectuals , and not the same usage of hallucinogenic drugs and anti-vietnam protests that was sweeping the american landscape . his pick-up line to her is , "" i don't have time to have a drink with you but can i have your telephone number . "" this "" take me seriously "" three and a half-hour film is surprisingly never dull , and is always diverting and titillating in its sexual characterization of these three rather likable and vulnerable participants in experimental living , that has its ups and downs as far as their compulsive libertine tendencies go . with all the so-called sexual freedom they have , it is discernible that there seems to be a lot of tension around them , making one wonder really if they are enjoying themselves more than their bourgeoisie counterparts are . all the quirkiness and nonsensical palaver of childish 1970s rebellion is seen here , along with a strong sense of connecting with others of the similar mind-set , allowing sex to be the liberating experience that it should be for them , if what they are into is to be taken seriously as some kind of revoluntionary statement . this is not your typical hollywood romantic happy ending for a film , but one that is very fitting for this film . it is worth noting , that the director of this seminal work , jean eustache , killed himself at age 42 in 1981 , and that certainly some parts of this film were based on his real-life experiences . the acting is superb . the only thing that is impressive about his intellect , was that he is often seen carrying a book by proust under his arms as he goes to the cafe to read , which is bookmarked to the story about "" the captive . "" all the women are special in their roles , making us look at them bodily-wise as well as at their mind . i see very little differences between the 1973 sexual mores and the 1999 ones . the later year is when i saw this film on video for the first time . how this film plays out , depends on one's perspective about sex and relationships , and how important they are ; if , perhaps , they are the most important worldly concerns one has , even more important than money or career or philosophy , then this film should prove to not only be entertaining but mindful . if thought of , as otherwise , then the film could still prove to be a most revealing study of how women look at men , especially men who think they are real smoothies . it also should indicate that women often choose these smoothies over other men because they like to play games with men and feel comfortable being around such men . what the film accomplishes , is to not rely on its plot and on any particular message , but to allow things to happen as they normally would , relying on the compelling nature of the actors to garner our interest , and our natural curiousity about what makes us love one another until it reaches the surface of some common understanding . that this was successfully done , can be attested by me from my own experiences and how important sex was for me in forming a relationship during the 1970s , it also seemed to shape my attitudes in love and in the sense i had of the world . sex always seems to be revolutionary because it is never static , it is never quite done in the same way . this film shows no signs of its age , it is impressive enough for me to watch today as it was for me to live vicariously through it in my thoughts of the 1970s . i think that the filmmaker could do no wrong in this film , every gesture and endless chat seemed so terribly right . and if the film is not an optimistic one , then that is just the way the filmmaker saw the situation of the lovers . "
920,"this is a noir film , one of the last one's shot that can truly emulate the spirit of the one's shot in the heyday of american noir , in the 40s and the 50s . melville wanted to make a french version of john huston's noir classic , the asphalt jungle ( 50 ) , as melville imbued in his film his strong beliefs about what a gangster picture should look like , making it original while covering all the subplots of that genre he could manage to fit into a film that runs for 150 minutes . the intense action scenes amidst the changing weather from rain to snow , plus the wooded area and the roadblocks the men must cross to get back to paris , gives the film an air of resolute desperation , that is intriguing to watch , as each camera shot is done by the hands of a master , reaching far into his characters and their surroundings . bunuel has very effectively used surreal shots like this in some of his films . the heist of the place vendome is excuted in silence for the 30- odd minutes it takes to pull off the job . for mattei , there is no such thing as police without informers . the film's conclusion is as violent as it has to be , since the mood was set from the film's onset to end this way . by this time , we know all the character's rather well , as we see who turns on the other , and how hypertense a policeman's job is , with not that much sanity separating his job from the criminal's . this is a top notch noir film . it has done an outstanding job in uncovering the themes of alienation and desperation , that drive men so hard that it is impossible for them to transcend their criminal nature . "
921,"this is the first film made under the label of dogma , a scandinavian film group inspired by the danish director von trier , which insists that their new manifesto on how to make films , be adhered to by those who make films under their label . this dogma consists of improvised acting and hand-held camera work , among other dogmas the film must adhere to . it reminds me most of how godard filmed during his mao stage , but without the apparent overt political messages , as godard's films during the late 60s were anti-film films , replete with diatribes against the bourgeoisie , which seemed filled with the director's hubris and self-congratulation on his political stance , that he was right and others wrong in their beliefs , and his rather tiresome political cliches , that seemed to be more opportunistic than spontaneous , even though every attempt was to make the film appear as if they were spontaneous . to spasse , is a danish term , which refers to those who act like idiots even though they are not . these episodes of spassing give this film an odd look that is guaranteed to turn off a lot people and anger many , especially those who expect more conventional ways of looking at the problems young people face in society . the theme of the movie is certainly obnoxious , it is very difficult to feel much of anything for these middle-class drop-outs , as we first encounter them in action in an elegant restaurant and watch them spasse , retardedly eating their food , under the direction of one of them ( susanne ) , who pretends to be their keeper , while one of them , stoffer , grabs on to a lady ( karen ) , sitting alone , and refuses to let go of her . they do another spassing in a rockwood furniture factory , which was more stupid than humorous and belabored any point that was trying to be made about workers in a factory or about middle-class values , it was goofy in a way to watch them operate , as it seemed to be similar to the way that fraternities might find their inane initiation rites uplifting to their older members who already went through the initiation process to join the group , but to outsiders it would seem like they were seeing a bunch of spoiled children . again , it was not funny , but yet , it was curiously interesting , in a prurient kind of way to see what the interaction was going to be between these two groups of outcasts . i think the point that von trier was trying to make , is that you really have to be an idiot to change the system , or think that you can change it , but that you can only be effective when you really confront who you are , reaching past the point of where authority rules who you are ; or else , you are stuck with the same cultural values you have always had and can't really change who you have been brought up as . being an idiot is the last act of despair . it is an act of courage . and it only matters when you can do it for real and not be using it to play a game . trier has made his point . he has won me over . this very unusual personal film , that is very difficult to warm up to , that mocks what is conventionally thought of as right , by doing what is unconscionable and politically incorrect , becomes only too real and too sad to comprehend , as it is presented so as not to give us a way out in our perception of how to deal with the alienation the youngsters feel , as they seem to be left with only their naive hopes and disillusionments ; and possibly , their emotional experiences that they can value . the film does not end with all loose ends tied up in a nice bow . and whether they reached their inner-self or not , something penetrated them , whether they are the better for this experience , is difficult to tell , but something significant to them did take place , just as we in the audience , whether we liked the film or not , something inside us was moved by what we saw taking place , causing us to react in a way we might not normally act when watching a film ; and , in my way of thinking , that is great filmmaking . "
922,"satyajit ray's 28th and last film , he died in 1992 , is one that he shot in radiant color , and is as close as you can come to being a masterpiece and not be one , it is much better than some of his recent films , which seemed to show his old-fashioned humanistic ideas of what a film should be like , to be in a decline with the modern theater goer's taste . this film moved me a great deal , as i found empathy with his deep feelings about the observations he has made regarding the affects of civilization . the plot is rather plain . this makes sudhindra more suspicious of him than before , as he thinks that he is certainly scholarly and articulate and well-travelled , but he might be this clever because he is really an impostor . the family has no other way of confirming in a hurry if this is really their uncle . ray's choice of traditional music and primitive folk dance numbers , especially when the uncle sees his niece dance with the women members of the santhal tribe , is pulsating to behold and a reminder to us that we shouldn't forget our roots . the opulence and warm-hearted nature of the film overcame the lack of real suspense the film had and its predictability . his light touch and simple human gestures with the camera , poured out a delightfully intellectual array of food for thought , allowing this film to be both visually entertaining and a homage to a great director's creative life , questioning and stirring up his audience to keep knowing more about themselves and the world they live in , as he leaves us with this last eloquent film , one that has his signature firmly on it . "
923,"the harshness and dreariness of the story is so pervasive , filled with so much pathos and heart wrenching evil , that it takes a great director such as rivette , to bring life and breath to the soul of the film , to keep out any superfluous material to this already startling story . rivette has made a memorable film , a grand and mesmorizing film , one that towers over other such benign hollywood films relating to this subject matter . her tragic plight is a powerful story , told with perfection of style and purpose , a story that is hard to put out of your mind . "
924,"one of the all time fun pictures , with enough ingredients in it to please a wide variety of film fans . this was english actor claude rains' american movie debut and vehicle to future stardom , even though he is visible for probably less than 30 seconds of the film , and that comes only at the film's climax , who only got the role because boris karloff turned it down , afraid that the role wouldn't work for him because he wouldn't be seen : but rains' distinctive voice was all that was needed to bring credibility to the part he will always be remembered for . a film so perfectly and magically done , that is based on the h . g . wells novel , that is faithful to the book while adding its own flavor of campiness to the story , such as a wonderfully bizarre una o'connor , screaming her head off , as "" the lion's head "" inn's wife of the owner and hostess to the invisible man . a special film such as this one , brings unmitigated joy to those of the 20th century who like to sit in the dark and watch a world of illusions come across a screen , an activity that could have hardly been envisioned a couple of thousand years ago , and is looked upon , even today , with a strange reserve by those who don't take their movies that seriously , not understanding just how rewarding it is for those who find certain films so important to them , that it becomes an integral part of their life and they can see the same film over and over again and still derive great satisfaction in what they are seeing . as for me , i could have seen this film as many as twenty times already , starting when i was 12-years-old and first saw it on a tv program called "" the million dollar movie , "" and i still get a kick out of it and see something delightfully new in it with each viewing . it is especially fun to watch it with youngsters who have never seen it before and are generally unfamiliar with watching a movie in b/w , just to watch the reaction you get from these youngsters , is enough of a charge , as they are perhaps surprised at the fun they are having in watching such a creaky story and its outdated hollywood version of an old established english country village . it is a film like this one , that can lure you into becoming a bona fide film buff . he is dressed so you can't see one feature of him , as he is wrapped in facial bandages and wearing a hat and an overcoat , rubber gloves and sun goggles . the gifted director james whale knew what to do with this story , as his serious sounding but humorous caveat throughout the film is : there are certain things on earth man must not meddle in . dr . kemp is scared out-of-his wits , and the scene is filled with pathos , melodrama , and ironical wit , as griffin dresses in his unwilling guest's robe and pajama's and usual bandage disguise , and explains to him that his invisibilty is not perfect , after eating his food it could be seen for an hour afterwards , until it is fully digested , that in the cold air you could see his breath , in the rain he would look like a bubble , that he has trouble walking down stairs as an invisible man , because he hasn't quite gotten used to the fact that he is invisible and therefore is very cautious of the downward steps he takes . but how do you capture an invisible man ? the film comes to its splendid climax in the dreaded snow , with john fulton's ultra-modern , for its day , special effects , adding enormous visual support to the sci-fi story , having the invisible man's footprints remarkably appear in the snow . "
925,"none of us know where we are going , could be the theme for this road movie , which is more intense and somber than most other movies of this ilk . their dreamlike odyssey , nevertheless , continuing , ever moving northward . the subtle answer , probably lies in what lies beyond the mist , there must be something to believe in , even if you can't see it . the camera work is stupendous , capturing in total the dreamlike quality of the film . we witness a wedding in the snow , a giant hand of creation being lifted out of the sea by a crane , and the innocent kids gazing out at a world of adults that is incomprehensible to them . the mood is so harsh , even biblical in scope , that when it asks the question in its voice-over , "" if i were to shout , who would hear me ? "" this film is not a soapy hollywood production , it is a film that is meant to haunt us , to make us ask questions that we cannot easily answer . "
926,"it is told in flashback , with a voice-over . but even he can't penetrate fedja's severe emotional problems . tremendous emotional energy is brought to the screen by an excellent story and exceptionally fine performances . this a dark film , and it is grimly shot , reflecting this dire mood . what is troubling about the film , is that no alternative way out of this dilemma was explored . in any case , it is better this way than the usual sentimental hollywood rags to riches treatment of such a story . this film is more in the spirit of reading someone like dickens , with strong oedipal emotions added to the bleakness of the story , as it is adapted from a novel by ferdinand bordewijk . "
927,"this is a come to your own conclusion movie , that might be a big let down if you were expecting to see the fable that is presented here come to a necessary resolution , but it is a film that gets better as you step away from it and realize how much intellectual weight there actually was in the telling of its austere story . whatever badii is searching for , this basically is still a philosophical movie , that asks people what is it that they want to get out of life and are they prepared to do something to ensure for themselves a happiness that hasn't been prescribed to them . it also indirectly asks the question , why would any one in good health and being sane , want to kill themselves . if i reply , help me out of the hole . if i don't , cover my body with 20 spadefuls of dirt . we don't really know the reason mr . badii wants to die and we know almost nothing about his personal life , except when he mentions to the poor seminarian he is trying to recruit for the job , that you don't know how someone else feels , you may be able to sympathize with them , but you could never understand their pain . but again , we can only guess at who he is and why he wants to commit suicide , to the director it is obviously not that important , or else he would have provided us with more information . he probably thought like i did , at first , that badii was a pervert trying to pick him up . again , the contrast between the men' silence and the noise from their work is explored . but he cannot do it for the reason that the moslem religion does not permit suicide , and badii's cogent argument , that sometimes by staying alive you do more harm to others than by dying , just falls on deaf ears . mr . bagheri ( baghieri ) is a turk , who talks incessantly , giving the film its lyrical voice it badly needed to counterpoint the tremendously impressive visual scope the film has so far counted on to give it its artistic touch , with its long shots of the barren mountain terrain the soldiers train on and where the workers spend their life on , and its close-ups on badii in his vehicle . then he asks badii , don't you want to taste the cherry ? don't you want to see the dawn and the beauty of the sunset , and the stars and the moon ? as he offers logical reasons for staying alive , that are indisputable . kiarostami' point is that all women are meant to be demeaned by such rigid laws of the state . films are meant to pose questions and not tell stories , is what the director is now telling us , since questions are more important to him , than anything else , they make us think harder about the things we do . my thought about the death of the linear film , as pronounced by the director , is that , if all you did was ask questions , as valuable as they are in the process of educating yourself , you would still end up being the idiot questioner , if that is all you did , question everything , because somewhere along the line , if you are honest with yourself , you will have to take a stand and state what it is you believe , and that statement might come across best in a linear story or some other film format , and not by posing more questions and becoming dogmatic about how a film should be made . why kiarostami might resort to this form of filmmaking , at least for this film , could have something to do with iran's repressive government and their long list of intolerances , that if he openly criticized them , it would probably result in no more kiarostami films for foreigners to adore . i'm a little reluctant to accept any one way of making films , as being the vade mecum of filmmaking , you just try to do what you can , if the film has a magic to it , it will work . i thought the ending of the film was not only a cop out , you don't know for sure if mr . badii committed suicide or not , but it also took the air out of the story's power and made it seem like a tease someone plays on you , first getting your hopes up and then going back on their word . kiarostami was having fun with the audience , and if you weren't in the mood for his jokes , then you might have thought like i did , that it was just too contrived and took away a very good experience i was having , with my imagination working on all cylinders , stimulated by the complexity of the problems raised ; and , by ending the film on that false note , and shooting it on video instead of film , it made it seem to me as if this was not a totally-serious attempt to look at ourselves and the society we live in , as i originally thought it was . if kiarostami thought i needed a break at that point of the film , that i was forgetting that it was just a film i was seeing , then he miscalculated how i felt . but i still believe the film had a potent political message that was delivered subterraneously , a message that is meant to shake us out of the habitual way we look at life ( and at film ) , and fail to recognize how important our dreamworld really is to us . and , in any case , i know from my past experiences with great filmmakers , that sometimes i don't like what i see from them the first time and later on change my mind and see more clearly what they were doing . so i'll leave open the option that my distaste for the film's ending will be subject to change , that is , if that is meant to be so . "
928,"fed up with this , but resigned to the fact that there is nothing he could do about it , he volunteers for duty in the war zone of ww11 . the niece also yields a muffled "" adieux "" , that he might have heard , but does not respond to . losing , because silence means you can't voice what is in your heart and mind , and by remaining silent it can be interpreted as a tacit acceptance of defeat and an unwillingness to call out for what is right and wrong . means , when the chips are down , he is still a believer in the motto : my country , right or wrong . melville's film is stimulating and perplexing , yet it is simple in tone and in human spirit . it gave me chills to watch how natural it all seemed ; firstly , because the protaganists were so real and the situation was so menacing ; and , secondly , everything happens in such a matter of fact way , enhanced by being shot in the harsh and convincing tones of black-and-white , giving the film a certain disquiet with the sea in the background that is unsettling to behold . "
929,"habit , supposedly a vampire movie , but , perhaps , it is more like a psychological thriller/love story . he looks out of it as he stumbles along , and as he looks around in disbelief , he sees the other celebrants in their costumes , and just goes stumbling on , not quite so sure if the scary creatures he is seeing are for real or induced from his inebriated state . you feel sam's agony of living in such a crowded city as n . y . , constantly hearing its pulsating city rhythms , experiencing its dark fears , and you are always aware of the noise and many distractions there are , especially when you need space to think . but one thing is certain , something bad is happening to him . what makes this vampire type of film different than the others , is that it is very personal , more about the psychological state of a guy who doesn't seem to be a psychotic , but is very confused about the new direction his life is taking him . most of the other films of this kind seem so unreal in regards to any kind of personal underpinnings that are frightening to them , that the fright in them appears to be from watching good filmmaking , not from something that can possibly crop up in their daily lives or invade their inner being . fessender has fully thought out the details of how a person can break down in front of us and not have any recourse in putting a stop to it , making the story as plausible and far-reaching as possible . there are a lot of things that happened involving relationships and inner perceptions , that you need time and peace of mind to think about , just as sam needed , that might never make sense . but that isn't the point . . . it is usually the things that don't make sense , that bother us the most . the film has a captivating style and playful mood to it , that keeps you involved in the intelligently told story , which is rare for this genre . "
930,"it is distinguished by mamet's sharp dialogue and a cast that is just outstanding . the edwardian-aged story is chocked full of sensibility and rife with a tautness to it that keeps you fully tuned into its dramatics . the the film version of that event takes liberties with the real story . he turns out to be a better and more feeling lawyer than what catherine expected of him , which adds even more weight to the already intriguing story . its legal theme "" let justice be done "" really equates in this particular case to doing the right thing legally , which is acquitting the youngster . nigel hawthorne was simply brilliant in this role , conveying an urbane wit and a strong backbone for taking on the fight for a cause he believes in with all his heart . this is just a wonderful and an almost flawless film ( the only flaw : the likable family seemed so smug with their upper-class status ) . david mamet has done a masterful job in directing someone else's words to its fullest potential . on paper , the outline for this story and its denouement , do not suggest how great a work this film turned out to be . even its old-fashioned story is more modern than it first appears to be . don't miss this one . you might have to wait a long time before you find a film with both a family and a lawyer portrayed in such a genuine and likable mold . it was delightfully startling to watch the nuances every character performed , as they held their emotions in check by their keen intellect . yet what came through even more than their perseverance , was that underneath , in their bellies , there were all sorts of emotions taking place that we could see overtly in their character . "
931,"a masterfully done noir piece . it is the kind of work that pre-dated the great jean-pierre melville's classic bob the gambler . characteristics have now become part of gangster film lore : that is , whenever gangsters are pictured in a romantic and old-fashioned manner . what distinguishes this film over most other noir films , is the grace it has and its ability to take its time and do a real character study of what max is like . and the director was just as interested in doing those scenes , as he was in filming the action ones . a great b/w film in every way possible . it has a hypnotic rhythm about it that takes you right into the gangster atmosphere it presents on screen ; there is not one wasted shot . "
932,"this is a visually appealing hong kong ghost story film , that is highly stylized , told from the perspective of a courtesan , anita mui ( fleur ) . the film is evocative ; its strength lying mostly in its poetical presentation , as it masterfully weaves a visual work of great scope and intelligence . the essence of the story does not depend on whether you believe in ghosts or not , though it would help if you would not be entirely reluctant to accept the possiblity that there could be a life-after-death . fleur , still dressed as a 1930s courtesan would be dressed , appears out of place in this modern capitalistic society , that has forgotten not only its ancient roots but its recent past . this film fascinated me on many levels , but mainly , it made me wonder about unfulfilled expectations in this world and how the netherworld could really exist as a domain for such things that remain unresolved . it allows us the opportunity to ask ourselves , if we can really believe in spiritual things without being spiritual ? is there something worth dying for ? this is truly one of the best films to come out of hong kong in the modern era . even its ironical ending , is handled with great dignity and care ; and , even if , you are not convinced by the logic of this super-natural tale , the beauty of its characterization is enough to make up for any shortcomings you might have thought this film had , such as the improbability of such vivid ghosts being so openly seen by everyone . "
933,"his menacing sneers are unforgetable , adding spice to a feature that makes grand use of every shot taken , and for its very limited budget of $75 , 000 , equals in style and eloquence the highest budgeted films of that era . kubrick has created a sinister noir film , employing dark angle shots and a hand held camera , which is used effectively in the street scenes where he probably didn't have official permission to be filming . it is a surprisingly well-made film , especially considering its low-budget constraints and the very independent way it was produced . it is one of my favorite noir films ; it had something about it that i enjoyed that goes beyond its taut story and authencity , it reminded me so much of how the 1950s were a time of alienation and failed dreams for youngsters who were trying to capitalize on the boom times after ww11 .

934,"all the sounds heard in the cell are the ones you would normally hear in a prison . there was no background music to take your mind off where you were , and by going through in precise real-time movements the daily prison grind , the constant personal searches and searches of the food parcels the men received , with the guard slicing up the rice puddings looking for files and such , the viewer gets the feeling what prison life is like for the men . there is something about claude that makes him stick out as an outsider , someone you don't feel right about . maybe its just that he comes off as too cunningly mannipulative in his contact with others to be thought of as a true friend . yet , he fits in so well with his new cellmates by not calling attention to himself and acting grateful for their quiet acceptance of him , that it is easy to see how he could be accepted by the men . they have accepted claude as one of them , as there was no reason not to , and feel that he has done his part so far in helping them dig a tunnel and has even shared with them the food parcels he has received . what he has created in this thriller is a marvel in simplicity and understated relationships , showing how uncertain it could be to trust an outsider with your life . that "
935,"it seems obvious , but it is the most pivotal point of the film . the sounds heard from the factory or the music in the background , signal the extremes of pleasure and pain felt . the romantic maudlin gypsy music that opens the film , is followed by the oppressive factory sounds- a source of confinement and class differences . it is not a very optimistic ending for a film that touches on subjects that are not very comfortable areas for discussion . the film , in the social realism mode of many eastern european films , is lighter than most films of this ilk , but what it can't overcome is the total bleakness of its subject matter and how too many of its responses must be considered as clich ? s to a western audience . nevertheless , this is a powerful and well made film , and the performance of katalin berek , in a role where she defies social conventions but who must be someone that the audience can empathize with , is handled with a quiet dignity and aplomb . the entire ensemble cast is well suited to bring off this drama in a successful way , making one wonder , that even when the bureaucrats are seen as benevolent and people are finally sympathetic to a young girl's plight , life is still difficult . and for the middle-age kata , life is so unjust , that even her well intentioned gestures might not be enough to overcome the problematic nature of a country that seems to be stuck in its own malaise . "
936,"life in this remote country village , called varkut , is oppressive , with nothing to do but work hard and eat a lot and watch bland tv programs . there is a coldness and distance about her , that speaks ill of hungarian society and its lack of warmth . the fierce b/w camera work captures the look of devastation on his face . the oppression is so great , that it is not even overtly mentioned , it is just taken for granted . but it is not pity that she needs , nor is it love that she can find or thinks she needs . this first feature-length directorial effort of m ? sz ? ros is staggering emotionally . its heartfelt dramatics and sparse dialogue , help make it a film of great quality and integrity . there is no soft pedaling of reality to spare the orphan's feelings . "
937,"this documentary gives us a rapid-fire tour of the city and his lifestyle , and is both an encyclopedic look at the city and a slyly amusing look at the loquacious tour guide . in a place like manhattan where it is easy to get lost in its few million people , it is non-conformists' characters like speed that make things interesting and worthwhile . that central park was designed by the transcendentalist fredrick law olmstead , whose vision for the park was not to play baseball or jog or roller blade or a place in which to work up a sweat but to focus on nature in a peaceful meditation . civilization is a place that is splitting us part ; it encourages people to never say the truth . one feels nauseous but not sick in it . for him , it is these little things in life that one notices that give it its relevance . i loved this ecclectic tour ; it is shot in a clear video which is blown-up to 35mm , and looks magnificent in b & w , giving the film the proper atmospheric expression for its tour ; the documentary works so well because speed's for real , as is his flowery monologue and his genuine nyc nasal accent . if you were ever interested in a tour of nyc , this is a good one to catch , and you don't even have to visit the city . "
938,"les cousins ( director/writer : claude chabrol ; screenwriter : paul g ? gauff ; cinematographer : henri deca ? ; cast : jean-claude brialy ( paul ) , gerard blain ( charles ) , juliette mayniel ( florence ) , claude-cerval ( clovis ) , 1959-fr . ) french new wave cinema at its best . we see this film through charles' naive eyes , who can't believe what he is seeing . he does enjoy wagner's music , as he uses that music and the superficial conversations he has with the other students , to convey a certain sophistication about life that he does not really have . a rather pathetic creature , whose goodness turns chabrol's stomach . no matter how impure a picture chabrol paints of paul and his dissolute lifestyle , paul has energy and is on the road to success . this all seems like logical advise , something we kind of expect a sympathetic parent to say to a hurt child . chabrol has carefully painted a picture , indicating that there is no help in sight for those who need it , whether from the pillars of society or from the rebels . skip the next paragraph if you don't want to know how the film ends and proceed to the last paragraph . chabrol's film would be interesting enough , just for its depiction of parisian student life , but when he moves into grounds of philosophical ethics and questions what love is to those who think they have fallen in love , his concepts become challenging intellectual engagements . the film questions the institutions and the people who have trust in them , and one's own morality . it is chabrol's rather cynical , but fair look at how parisian society operates and how young people suffer from the pangs of youth , sometimes even in a deadly manner . "
939,"strange , bizarre , confusing , and psychedelic , all are apt descriptions for this easy to follow story but most difficult film to keep track of . that is mainly due to the elliptical editing , fast cuts , forward and backward flashbacks , and a montage of images with all kinds of implications behind them . it is a film , that of all studios , for warner bros . to come out with it , just doesn't make sense . this is not the type of independent artistic film they make over there . their reaction to seeing the finished product was predictably one of disbelief and disgust . nicolas roeg , at that point , disassociated himself from the film , but since his name was left on it , and cammell was an inexperienced 26-year-old director , roeg unfairly received the lion's share of the critical credit that was to come from some of the established critics who , true to form , didn't recognize what an innovative and masterful film it was until much later . an underground audience , well-aware of the peyote mushrooms and psychedelic flashes throughout the film , rushed to see it in a partylike 'hippie' atmosphere during the midnight hours it was shown , to packed audiences . warner bros . was clueless how to market the film , whether to make it a mick jagger 'rock' experience or as a gangster film . they danced , sang an ode to harry , and we saw that they can be just as notorious as america's gangsters . it seems as if , in a strange way , these two opposites , have similar impulses that give them their power to succeeed . i guess it is one head trip exchanged for another , each doing it the way they know best . chas looks and acts as anything but what society would take for normal . performance is also noted for its memorable music , as arranged by the rock genius , jack nietzche . warner bros . tried suing the director cammell after seeing how he completed the film , hoping not to release it , that's how bad the feelings were , for a film that lived on to become a cult favorite even though it never got its proper due with the straight critics and public . it was a film whose psychedelic flashes might seem a bit dated now , but all the best directors from kubrick to scorsese borrowed freely from it , as it changed the way many mainstream films were to be made after 1970 . the freshness and energy and montages of the film are unique , as it was able to mix the world of art with violence , something that seems to be a natural fit , as shown in these kaleidoscope images . it is a film that both gangsters and artists can sink their teeth into , even if the gangster might fail to recognize how he looks to others or to himself . a one of a kind film , deserving of much critical praise , as it is a most efficacious look at the subculture of the gangster and artist worlds and , simultaneously , a most enigmatic film to try and take in all its fanciful images and perversions and drug induced fantasies , though time has taken away some of its freshness , it still is a work of considerable power . "
940,"it was different in style than other films at the time and was received very well by the critics . the film turned out to be visually satisfying to audiences , though not pleasing all the critics . through all kinds of sexual debasements and perversities that are shown in this poorly received film , pasolini attempted to make his point about current italian society being like fascism . pasolini , the decadent anti-fascist , pro-communist , homosexual artist is a key figure in trying to come to grips with modern italy and its many passions , this documentary provides some useful fodder about him , whether you are a novice to him or have followed his career fully . one thing i can say for sure about pasolini , is that he is always interesting , even if he isn't always understood . this documentary gives one a good quick-look at him and should encourage those who are so inclined , to check-out his films or books , if they haven't done so before . "
941,"what is noteworthy about the telling of the story , is how earnest and real their situation is , and how magnificently graceful the actors are , slowly revealing the sore points and tender sides of their troubled souls . the subplots that develop connect somehow with the main characters in an effortless way . it seems whatever you do in modern alaska , you have to hurt someone or something , whether intentionally or not . the ending of the film is problematic and inconclusive , though it seems apparent that they are doomed . many viewers will be disappointed that there is no payoff in the story . the film was well served by a capable cast ; and , even if , its story bit off a lot of ground to chew , a lot more than it was capable of fully digesting ( too many topics from environmental issues to dysfunctional families ) , it was still good storytelling . but it did try to get too clever with the plot allowing every angle of the character's problems to fit too nicely together-- there was too much of a parallel symbolism of the castaways relating to their three lives that was too neat for its own good . but this is topped by thought provoking storytelling , one that was visually stunning as well as accomplished with mature dialogue . the film didn't always work , as melodramatics seemed to take away from the tremendous drive the story had on its own merits as a straight romantic tale . but what kept it compelling was the human drama , that made me want to think that the trio had found something on their journey that they didn't realize that they had before . though the unresolved ending to the film might bother some viewers , that of being in a state of limbo is not the worst way in which to end a film , especially one where the storytelling itself is the aspect of the film that veers from guarded hope to fatalism , where each of the characters is seen on this deserted island as not being able to run away from their problems anymore . "
942,"this emotionally moving film will look into that and will also examine the heart aches of two working class girls , doing it in a way only the french can do it justice . isa is someone we think we know but really don't , as she is prone to be friendly and willing to make relationships , opening her dark saucer eyes wide and offering an engaging smile full of her milky white teeth to go along with her warm personality and trim look of close-cropped black hair ; but , we are , also , distracted by a mysterious scar she has on her right eyebrow , which is never explained . there is a classic look of disgust on the face of isa , that seems to be saying , you are really sick , when she finally realizes that she has to move on from here . the performances of the two actresses was bewitching , as the two women deservedly shared best actress honors last year at cannes . the poignancy and merits of the film , are in depicting accurately the reality of the girls' lives . it is a film without one false note of sympathy or sentimentality in it . this is not the type of a girl-buddy movie as seen in some hollywood films of late , filled with glibness and glitter and canned experiences . here , what happens has the ring of truth to it and is powerful in the sense that its simple telling of the tale , without trying to be cute or pedantic , turns out to be profound . this debut film for the 42-year-old director , done with the austerity of a master , reminiscent of someone like a robert bresson , is a work of considerable merit . it is a film that not only depicted the shattering of a friendship and a realistic look at life for the working class , but it probed into the deep seated loneliness found within each of the girls , looking at it in a poetic way . "
943,"now this is an indie cult film , if ever there was one . they sell both bibles and guns , two contrasting products that fit very well into the mainstream of american society , makes for a most interesting commentary on the american landscape , as directed and written by the south african , daniel j . harris . this b/w , gritty film , is so well-paced and flies by so quickly , that you feel you know these men in the short time span you meet them and you don't want the film to end before you find out just what happens to them , as things begin to turn sour for them . this unique film , in the style of the maysles brother's the salesmen , packs a wallop and a sales pitch that goes beyond the ordinary pseudo-documentary and improvisational work . the theme of the film is really geared for the 1960s in psychology , in the music played and in the dress and style of the salesmen . but were're in the '90s all right and that only adds weight to the idea that these men are really dead already but they just don't know it . these very repulsive reactionary types are so-well caught on camera , as they go from reading the script to ad libbing without missing a beat , in fact the unrehearsed scenes have a special flair about them that is macabre . one of the really powerful scenes , is the opening one when they are selling the collectors' edition bible set and a defender 500 pump-action shotgun in a trailer , it is almost unnerving that they keep a straight face when they say to the poor whites they are selling this to , "" the american family deserves to be well-armed and well-read . "" the director seems to imply , isn't that what america is about , anyway . they sold me on this film . these "" stars "" certainly bring a level of authenticity to the film that is uniquely satifsying . this , suprisingly enough , is a not to be missed film , if you can ever locate it on cable . "
944,"this is a dogma 95 styled film , where the danish filmmaker's group manifesto determines the rules for how the film is to be made . the idea is to give their films a fresh look and for them to provide the unexpected , and to catch on film the complete truth from its characters and their situations . this film was shot with a small video camera ( a sony pc7 ) that fits in the palm of your hand , then it is transferred to the prescribed dogma 35-millimeter format . i suppose it is fair to assume that one of the reasons that this manifesto was drawn up in 1995 by four danish filmmakers--christian levring , soren kragh-jacobsen , thomas vinterberg , and lars von trier-- was to give them publicity and challenge the film community to create innovative films . so far the only two films i saw from this group , von trier's the idiots & breaking the waves , have been challenging and impressive films . for those interested in what their dogma document actually states , i give you the following example : "" 2 . the sound must never be produced apart from the image or vice versa . any movement or immobility attainable in the hand is permitted . the film must be in color . special lighting is not acceptable . ( if there is too little light for exposure , the scene must be cut or a single lamp [must] be attached to the camera . ) "" 6 . the film must not contain superficial action . is to say that the film takes place here and now . ) "" 8 . genre movies are not acceptable . "" 10 . the director must not be credited . "" furthermore , i swear as a director to refrain from personal taste ! i am no longer an artist . i swear to refrain from creating a 'work , ' as i regard the instant as more important than the whole . my supreme goal is to force the truth out of my characters and settings . i swear to do so by all the means available and at the cost of any good taste and any aesthetic considerations . "" rules like that rub me the wrong way . what i ask from a film , is for it to be imaginative and well-made , and i don't particularly care how the filmmaker accomplishes that . it would be impossible to go into the minute details of the film without immeasurably spoiling it for the viewer who hasn't seen the film . my pleasure in seeing it was that i was caught completely unaware of what was to occur and that shock kept me absorbed in the story , not quite knowing what to expect next . this might be the secret reason why the film worked so well , as i was made to feel like one of the guests in this theatrical film . the result of the film was exhilerating , dogma or not , it is a work that is scathing , penetrating layers of deceit and festering wounds that cannot be healed . but it was to no avail . to point out how the guests weren't quite sure of anything that was happening there , they are shown eating lobster , or salmon , or tomato soup , each one unsure of what they were served . the celebration is indeed a celebration not to be forgotten soon . it drains the emotions , somehow satisfies the intellect , and challenges the conventions of the usual fare of sophisticated family drama . vinterberg declares how the impact of helge's revelation affected everyone in the immediate family , and how that acted as a cleansing for the tribe , something that was essential for their psyches . at least , they now have some kind of a shot of pulling themselves together , even though the film does not show any of them changing internally . and how the film accomplished this , was through good storytelling , where one doesn't need any false constraints , something that is reminiscent of greek tragedy or shakespearean drama . "
945,"his bust on the rock , he says , signifies that , "" i was the rock and the rock was me . "" the visionary dream is evocative of the music he created for the 1st movement of the third sympathy , as it is heard and interpreted by russell in a way that is highly complimentary to a composer whom he obviously admires , flawed personality , not withstanding . what gives the film force and a sense of inspired madness , and makes this a work the musical aficionado might question regarding its authenticity but the film buff might applaud for its richness of visuals , are a few very inventive scenes . the conversion scene becomes the most powerful and outlandish one in the film , as it is filmed as if were a silent movie changing to a talkie at the moment of the conversion . this scene comes on so strong as to drown out any other attempt by russell to have a more subdued film than he usually shoots for . he will then eat the non-kosher pig meat and drink a glass of milk with it , completing his conversion . always insecure and troubled , never happy , always irritable and petulant , a most unpleasant person , and a sexist ; but , a musical genius , is the impression of mahler that russell convincingly leaves us with . as mahler , in despite of his pettiness , bravely tells his wife , choose between me and max , but do not choose me because of duty , duty always destroys . but it is the music of mahler that is refreshingly digested , admittedly a music for acquired tastes , but a music that i most heartily appreciated , that gives the film its resonance . the film also plays like visconti's death in venice gone astray , where homo-erotic shots are coupled with coarse hetero-sexual shots . which result for russell , a director who has proven himself to be a music lover , who knows how to be flamboyant and controversial , into making a film that was very impressive . though the film , like mahler's music , is clearly not for everyone . "
946,"the film critic , jonathan rosenbaum , has written a great review on the merits of jacques demy and his film , the umbrellas of cherbourg , going on to compare demy to the great japanese film director , yasujiro ozu . that both men achieved excellent success in their films by portraying the human condition through the eyes of normal lifestyles is , indeed , a curious oddity . umbrellas is made into an opera-like film by composer michel legrand . the actors sing their lines rather than just say them . the film itself is lushly colored in pastels , offering a very brilliant color-coordinated production . this story doesn't seem to be much on paper , but it is as poignant , as surely as it is ordinary . it is one that happens most of the time , rather than the reverse being true , of people marrying for love . and that is demy's point , that coincidences , luck , and good timing seem to matter even more than love . everything about this film was done to perfection . demy is one of the most underrated directors of french cinema . american audiences rarely get a chance to see his great body of films , and that is surely their loss . "
947,"the conflict inside him revolves around the tremendous high he gets over saving a life- there is no better feeling , he tells us in a voiceover , his usual way of conveying to the viewer what he is thinking- and the low point is from all the depravity and hopelessness and horror he sees all around him everyday . these images become a reminder of what hell might look like . that in a nutshell is the plot of the film , as this is a story mostly about character development and the unique personalities of those who choose to work under such trying conditions , and of the uncertain relationship that develops between two kindred spirits , mary and frank . the audience is taken along for the grim ride and the entertainment comes from the constant gallows humor of these very obsessively comedic ems men , who provide the necessary breaks in the story for everyone concerned , that is audience and driver alike . things are so insane that if you don't laugh , you can succumb to the intensity of the situation by just watching it . this is a dark comedy in the real sense of being dark , with the noir style to the film provided by scorsese's frequent screenwriter , paul schrader ( taxi driver/raging bull/the last temptation of christ ) . this seems to give the patient a pulse and the family some hope . frank's way is through coffee , whiskey , vitamin shots , and living with ghosts-- and none of them work . this film is intense all right , and it drags on for much too long a look at the insane world it envisions , making its way through a grotesque looking city and a hospital that is likened to a crazy house . the misery uncovered is catching , like certain diseases are . but is it worth it ? does the film have something salient to say , as scorsese seems more comfortable in these surroundings than he did in the foreign turf of the age of innocence and kundun , for instance ? is there entertainment value in this story ? that i really don't know , but i do know that it all seemed too real and that the acting was superb , one couldn't help but get entangled in the lives of the characters , and there was a rush of adrenaline emanating from the highs and even the lows experienced . the nicolas cage performance caught the nuances of his character in a bewitching manner , as in his crazed ems role , he catches the futility and desperation he feels gnawing at him from inside and displays an engaging chemistry with the three drivers and with patricia arquette . the ambulance drivers more or less drove home the philosophical points of the film , as they acted out the insanity of the situation they were in and complemented his mood swings of being beaten down or hyper , with the sheer madness of their gall and sometimes perversive attitude toward the job . the photography was mesmerizing , capturing the hostile living conditions of the neighborhood and filling the screen at times with the beauty of a fire show amid the sirens and turbulence of the night , and in the background , we can see the famous city skyscrapers of the city shimmering in the night sky , seemingly changing colors . i'm glad that scorsese has made a film that asks a lot of questions of the viewer , questions that take time to answer because they are complex , and could best be answered by one's experience with matters of life and death . and from what is mentioned in the story , we learn that there are spirits that pull you one way or the other , and sometimes the pull is not to want to live anymore . that should give one something to think about . scorsese has made a technically perfect film and an artistic one , but is one that is not suited for everyone's taste , since it takes getting used to the trauma of the story and its appalling inertia ; but , the benefits are immense for those who stick with it . scorsese is undoubtedly one of the finest working directors and he knows how to provoke an audience to feel the pain of someone else , something that is very difficult to obtain in this medium . this is a very tough film to honestly say that you thoroughly enjoyed it , but what's more important than that , is how it lingers with you for a long time after seeing it and how compelling it is in a meaningful way . this film , i expect , will be better thought of than most films of the '90s that attempt to focus in on the city landscape , including all those films that were so entertaining but in the end were not as nurturing to the soul as this one was . it is easy to compare this film to his masterpiece , taxi driver , and say that both films were about a dying city , about someone who works by driving either a taxi or ambulance at night , and about a similar hero who had a tortured soul that needed redemption , but the former film was so much better because it had more action in it , more energy , and did not compromise the story's pessimism . but i found this film to be more subtle and more optimistic in a spiritual sense , and even its most pressing fault , that the subject matter hits too close to the miserable reality of things in the city and makes this a difficult film to sit through , should not be that deterring to the serious moviegoer . this film can't help being anything but a disturbing film , one that questions the degree of contemporary insanity , and it is not necessarily a better or worse film than the other one , but it is one that has more psychological layers of complexity to it that needs to be looked at more carefully . "
948,"i was born , but . . . the shochiku kamata studio specialized in nonsense comedies , something the great director , one of the world's most acclaimed , yasujiro ozu ( the tokyo story/late spring/floating weeds ) was keen on doing during this period of his film career , when he refused to make talkies until yielding in 1935 , but continued to make silent social comedies , somewhat in the style and equal to in quality to the charlie chaplin and buster keaton films , though ozu's films were seen through the eyes of children rather than taken from the adult's point of view . they were ably co-scripted by the master of the nonsense film , akira fushimi . in i was born , but . . . , a film with lots of sight-gags , made as a social comedy turning darker as the story got a bit more involved with the patriarch of the family , mr . yoshii ( tatsuo saito ) . this splendid example of a salaryman's film , is the first great film of the master's , with many others to follow . there is a comic sandal fight among the boys , which brings out the film's visual humor from the way the framing of the shots magnifies the synchronized reactions of the two fighters . in fact , ozu's camera angles for adults when talking to children , are always taken from a higher elevation so that the adults are talking down to the children , always in a position of superiority . ozu draws the analogy of the workplace power structure to the way children naturally socialize , and states that the adults power is vindictively social , derived from one's station in life and how much money one has . the home movies become unbearably embarrassing to watch for yoshii and the children , as yoshii acts the part of the clown in them and is seen as an obviously inferior man than his boss . yoshii , himself , is embarrassed that he has to lower himself so much , but he is secretly pleased that he is so successful as a clown and can make everybody laugh . taro's only comment is , your father is really funny . ozu' other purpose of showing the home film , being always the gagman , it also gives him a chance to parody his own way of shooting films by having the home movie filmed in the same style he uses for this movie , such as by using the same tracking shots and camera height angles . the wry salaryman responds , "" if i didn't , i wouldn't get paid and you wouldn't eat . "" the boys illusion is that all power can be won through one's talents . but in the business world , the boss doesn't have to possess those character traits , he is the boss because that is the way society is structured , and it pays to submit to that hierarchy or else you will be left out in the cold to fend for yourself . the "" but "" in the film's title comes into place , as it indicates that everyone is born equal , "" but "" that changes soon enough . there is always something to disturb the stability assumed from the outset . it is now clear that yoshii grovels because he can't do anything else about it . and like many parents in america , he only wishes his children have a better life than he does , which draws him closer to the audience and presents him in a more sympathetic light . the plot of the film is encompassed within a short five-day period , and it parallels in a didactic way the social structure of the children and the grownups , and how in each group adjustments have to be made in order to survive , with the majority of the film being concerned about how the boys start growing up . the adult world is mainly used as a expansion of the boys' limited horizons . "
949,"he has come up with a possible masterpiece , arguably his best film , that overcomes a questionable b-movie plot , to achieve an elegant , memorable , and poetic story . he leaves for work at the sound of the eerie throbbing of the jungle drums , which is only announcing that the sugar syrup is ready to be poured . it is interesting to note , how this 1940s film had a tolerant and respectful attitude to blacks , and even allowed them to be critical of upper-class whites without being rebuffed for it . but the treatment doesn't work . one of the all time greatest scenes in horror movie lore takes place , as betsy takes the sleepwalking jessica through the thick jungle of the sugar cane fields while the howling wind and rustling branches and sound of a conch is being blown to bring to the ceremony the faithful . the ritual voodoo ceremony is done in a deliberate and quietly dignified manner , with the result being hypnotic . the obscure motives of the mother and the nurse , and to who was at fault in paul's marriage , and what role wesley plays in all this , is never cleared up completely by the film but that only makes the story more intriguing . jessica's personality is seen differently through the eyes of others , but since she was a zombie for the whole film , we have no idea what her role was in this indelicate affair . the seemingly innocent betsy , seems clever enough to have thought of a solution to this problem that could benefit her . the natives want the case of the zombie settled , they feel there is enough sadness on the island , as is . the power of the script , is in the telling of a tale about local superstition built around the moral dilemma of what is the christian concept of right and wrong , and by creating an unforgettable and haunting atmosphere that blows away the less than sterling acting by the male leads and the unlikeliehood of the story being totally believable . tourneau's direction for this low-budget film was marvelous , and it was spectacularly shot by roy hunt in its chiaroscuro imagery , bringing to light a film that is both incredible and magical . "
950," mirrors should reflect a little before throwing back images .  georges auric , cocteau's lifelong musical collaborator , said that he wanted to compose the score for an animated cartoon . cocteau was asked to provide a scenario . this became "" the blood of a poet , "" still one of the most widely viewed of all cocteau's screenworks . there has never been a film quite like le sang d'un poete . cocteau used all his energy and his diverse talents in a medium that was new to him , as this film represented an aesthetic milestone in his career . was it nonsense or serious filmmaking ? in my opinion , a little of both , though the result of the film is a serious work . this 60 minute film is ostensibly , a work on the nature of creating art . special weightless effects were obtained by camera trickery to show the little girl flying up to the ceiling and the poet moving painfully along the corridor wall . once cocteau discovered that he could turn shooting disasters into excellent footage , he was off on a career of making films that carried his trait of creating trick shots : the miraculous mirror and mercury scene in orphee , the live arms holding the candelabra from the walls of la belle et la bete , and the accelerated time sequences of flowers opening in le testament d'orphee are only a few examples of the trick shots he used in his later films . for cocteau , poetry is a coat-of-arms . the film ends with the message : mortal tedium of immortality . in the last frame , an industrial chimney shown in the beginning of the film , finally collapses and all material things are crushed . so much of this film is mysterious and vague , undoubtedly autobiographical in content and motif : cocteau himself always denied the presence of hidden symbolism in the film , but word got about that it had anti-christian undercurrents . this was really not so , according to cocteau , but the false rumor did its damage . it greatly distressed the noailles . the life-line of the movie is its imagery , which can be interpreted many different ways , emphasizing cocteau's view that art disclaimed the world of ordinary appearances and projected vision to be a symbolic representation that must be continually changing , because if it doesn't it will be dead like classicism is and it will cease to exist . the director was afraid that the avant-garde movement would die one day like all other artistic movements have . because of its unusual theme and style and unpredictability , this is a film that deserves the high accolades many film critics have bestowed upon it . it resolutely shows how the filmmaker communicates into the spirit world , and he does so without being pretentious .

951,"first-time film director and former music video director spike jonze has come up with a tantalizing feast for the self to nosh on , cooked by charles kaufman's original screenplay , that offers up some very intangible delicacies on its plate , such as a psychological , personal and sexual identity study , allowing the eater to suspend belief about what is being digested and be allowed to tastefully enter into the mind of another being . it is a playful and provocative look at determining one's identity and how celebrity is viewed from within , featuring an actual celebrity , the performer , john malkovich , who is playing himself , as the mind who is being entered . if someone could market via virtual reality how to actually do that , it might cost as much as $200 for a 15 minute sightseeing trip down that path , the charge established in the film for such a trip , while for the movie viewer it is only for the nominal cost of a movie ticket that one gets to have such a unique experience . the running gag being , that the overhead and the rent are also low here . since the glimpse into malkovich's head is more or less fictional , it's delightfully funny to find craig turning up inside the man's head and to find the actor eating toast and reading the wall street journal in his park avenue apartment . the film was brilliant in spots but towards the end ran out of enough nourishing food to sustain its steady diet of farcical comedy . but even as it was petering out , it still managed to have enough brilliant glimpses at celebrity and how some crave that sort of identity , to make it both hilarious and somewhat intellectually appealing , and leave off with an ending that is unnerving . what makes this insane premise work out so surprisingly well , is that the actors get the joke and run with it , even flushing out seemingly irrelevant things about one's inner being along the way that are fun to scrutinize . and if anything more can be said about john malkovich than that he is a grand actor , it is that he comes across as a good person , someone with a good sense of humor and someone who is able to heartily have a laugh at himself even if it is supposedly at his own expense . this is the kind of strange film that one would expect to be released as an art-house indie , yet here it is playing as a mainstream big production . "
952,"this is a must see film for historical reasons or if you are a film buff . its cinematic influence is tremendous on so many great directors that range from fritz lang to billy wilder . so they improvised and created an eerie style that brought the artistic german expressionist movement into the film . this unique film influenced the genres of horror , children's fairy tales , and crime films from the '20s - '50s , and by using the same style of lighting and dark mood as these mystery stories , they became known as noir films after ww11 . this seemingly simple murder plot , of a crazed medieval-type of svengali , who orders his somnambulist to do his killings , is much more complex than that , and it is one of the reasons that this film has meant so much to so many different people at different time periods . by its odd style , accented mannerisms , all the actors wearing grotesque makeup , and exhibiting a stagy acting method , it becomes a very unsettling film . through its amazing sets , the film best expresses the insanity of its theme , and the story enhances this theme , as the authorities are shown to be either incompetent or uncaring , and madness proves to be the staple of the film . this is the story that the narrator is telling . but it is all so confusing , that the possibility exists the narrator is just making this whole thing up . this asylum director must have liked what he read about the evil magician , with the idea that imitation is the best form of flattery , as this book is found in his desk . but the story doesn't end on this note . they did not want a film with the message that authority is not to be trusted and should be subject to severe questioning . this story is now viewed from the point of view of a "" framing device , "" as it appears that all that previously happened could be derived from the narrator's deranged imagination . the last chilling words coming from dr . caligari , who is now seen as a more benevolent soul , go loosely like this : boy , have i got a cure for you . caligari , however limited in scope , is still a powerhouse of a horror film , a significant breakthrough in style and in expression : a poetical vision . even in its altered story form , the film is still spellbinding and weird , as its ambiguity makes for many interpretations . either francis or caligari could be the lunatic . this note of ambiguity , instead of spoiling the story , only adds further intrigue . this tale of lunacy smolders in our psyches and allows us to look at this story's skewed world without knowing all the answers . we are left wondering if there could ever be justice in this world , as corrupt powers always seem to have a way of covering up their misdeeds . "
953,"this is a grim morality tale that can't help putting you in someone else's shoes , wondering what you would do if you were in the same situation . instead , he does the most savage thing he could possibly do , he gets igor , who is becoming very squeamish at this point , to help him bury amidou in concrete , even if he is aware that amidou is still barely alive . how cruel can people be to others ! . . . but something has happened to the kid . la promesse has the harsh reality to it that a documentary might have , and considering that the sibling film directors are acclaimed documentary directors for over two decades , it is easy to see that even though this story is fictionalized it , neverthess , is filmed in the manner of the very real experiences that the filmmakers have noted going on in modern europe . the three main characters of the story are cast perfectly . the film could have been done from the father's point of view instead of the son's ; and , even more interestingly , from assita's ( the widow ) way of seeing things , and the film would have still had a tremendous impact . but there is an unmistakable presence she has , that clearly shows the nobility of her character , especially when contrasted with all those around her whose minds are so blemished . roger is one of the slimiest guys you could ever meet , someone who tries to pretend he is good but it so obviously not , that it is written all over him what he really is . there is room for us to see in him what makes him act the way he does , that he is not that far removed from the consciousness' of the ordinary man in the street , except for his utter lack of decorum and any sort of social conscience . from his point of view , we could see that he is only looking out for number one , thinking , that if he doesn't , who else will . but they can't see anything wrong . this powerful tale is unflinchingly honest and moving . it casts a dark shadow over a civilized country's technological prowess in the world , and questions its humanity and moral perspectives . it does so in a most tangible way , in a way that should be a disturbing reminder of how complex the problem of immigration is , in a film that is piercingly on target as a challenge for the european countrys to keep their "" promise "" to the immigrants and to see how corrupt their system is and how it doesn't really stop these powerless people from being exploited . "
954,"the often filmed story of joan of arc , but a story that is seldom successfully filmed , is attempted again by jacques rivette ( up/down/fragile ( 95 ) /la belle noiseuse ( 91 ) /la religieuse ( 65 ) /celine et julie vont en bateau ( 74 ) ) , and the results for this epic study of joan are more than pleasing but less than scintillating . rivette was born in rouen , france , in 1928 and it is interesting to note , that was the year when dreyer's magnificent silent version of joan first appeared onscreen , which was made as a spiritual testament to joan's moral courage . he was a critic at cahiers du cinema and the much praised movie director is now considered to be one of the more noted unorthodox directors around , who will be forever associated with the french new wave . sumptuously filmed in brilliant color , it captures best the wonderful shades of france's fall and wintery colors . scenes shift as dates change and are so indicated onscreen . we see in rivette's joan , that it is her sobering historical story that counts the most and the price joan will pay for that , is that when compared with dreyer's joan , we don't have the same intense passion for her as we do for dreyer's more spiritual and intense joan . in this film , it is the king's coldness and the church's intrigue that strikes us , while joan and the soldiers she fights with , are given a warm treatment , as if they were the heroes in a hollywood war movie . the floundering country is in such a bad state , that it is about to be completely taken over by the british . my sign from god , will be proven on the battlefield of orleans . by may of 1431 , she is told by the bishop at rouen to either abjure or burn at the cross . she says , "" god has pity on me , i damned myself to save my life . . . but this film seems to be the most accurate version of all the joan films , thus far , as rivette followed the trial transcripts and whatever history of her battles were recorded by eyewitnesses , but it failed to move me in an intimate way as much as the dreyer version did , which made more of a personal statement and an artistic response to those in power who try to stifle the voice of an individual's expression , while rivette uses the visual epic scope of history to make his point , that the call for freedom is not necessarily separate from politics . her performance was more than acceptable , but it was not memorable or moving . rivette's version is good to see as a companion piece to dreyer , as they both have things in their films that the other never attempted , and though rivette's version is intriguing and colorful and politically savvy , it is not a masterpiece . it is just missing that magical ingredient in it , the something that dreyer found when he went for the abstractions , the something that history couldn't tell . "
955,"the public loved these films , until the "" talkie "" pictures came into being and this film was forgotten until rediscovered in the 1950s by henri langlois and in the 1960s by directors such as alain resnais and jacques rivette . musidora was a former music hall star , whose raven hair and seductive looks suited her villainous black-garbed heroine role in contrast to the sugary sweet blond american heroines at the time , who starred in popular serials such as the perils of pauline and the exploits of elaine . the combination of lyrical , odd scenes of naturalism and the melodrama of a crime-fiction story , as the film is full of disappearances and disguises , sudden deaths and uncanny resurrections , hidden trapdoors and secret tunnels , bus chases and rooftop escapes- which gave the film its power , its sense of dread ( perfectly matching the public's mood at the time of world war1 ) . and it was that , coupled with their almost anarchistic view of society ( the vampires steal only from the rich ) , and their often contemptuous disregard of logic ( the result of tight shooting schedules ) , that made the films so popular . les vampires was treasured by surrealists like andre breton and louis aragon , which gave it weight in intellectual circles , also . les vampires is one of france's great classic contributions to the world of cinema ; and fortunately , this once lost film has now been restored and is available on video . "
956,"celine and julie go boating ( celine et julie vont en bateau ) ( director/writer : jacques rivette ; screenwriters : eduardo de gregorio/juliet berto/bulle ogier/dominique labourier/marie-france pisier ; cinematographers : michel cenet/jacques renard ; cast : juliet berto ( celine ) , dominque labourier ( julie ) , bulle ogier ( camille ) , barbet schroeder ( olivier ) , marie-france pisier ( sophie ) , 1974-fr . ) it is an incomprehensible , enjoyable , uninhibited slapstick romp . as insignificant as the title of the film is to the story- i am at least sure that celine and julie are seen at one moment towards the end of the film going boating ( at least , i think i saw them ) . but there are unusual complications to this already complicated story ; and , in the subplot , there are two actresses playing the same part , berto/ogier and dominque/piser . what results is an hallucinatory fable : that is funny , scary , idiosyncratic , original , lesbian-centered , derivative of cartoons and musicals , and truly indescribable . it is a true cinephile's delight , and a challenge to the old linear way of looking at films . it is a film that should be seen more than once , since it requires proper mood and spirit to enter its delightful summertime montmartre locale and the visions of its meditations , and it takes some getting used to , since this is a different type of cinema from the usual american fare . this is a special movie that some might detest or feel put upon on first viewing it , but is for others an exhilarating work , an outstanding example of a non-commercial film , allowed to take on the personalities of the stars without worry about it being a formula story or needing a glib ending . it is deserving of its wonderful reputation among cinephiles . as my mother used to say , when she gave me something to eat as a child that i wasn't familiar with and i made a face , try it , who knows , you might like it . "
957,"it was one of the early yiddish talkies to date and one of the most prestigious . schwartz was celebrated as being the 'olivier of the yiddish stage . 'he is one of the world's greatest actors ( he was tevye in fiddler on the roof ) but he is not as recognizable a name as he should be . this comedy/romance that turns dramatic , should give you a good idea of how great an actor he is . though he is not a religious man , he respects the traditions , as the film makes many biblical allusions in telling its story . "
958,"those two great legends in the horror field went on from here to make a total of seven films together , but none as co-stars with equal parts , or in a feature that was as good as this one was . in most of their films together , lugosi , who was the poorer actor of the two because of his limited english , was always cast in the lesser role . the script for this film was altered so much , that the only thing remaining from poe's story , is the brief appearance of the black cat in the film . though the film does evoke the mood of a poe story and the feelings of kafka . the crowley characterization was by boris karloff , who played the role of hjalmar poelzig . he will mention that he is a writer of mystery books , and he quickly adds , books that are unimportant , and that if he had any sense he would be honeymooning in niagara falls . he then offers an excuse for vitus's action , saying he has a common phobia , but in an extreme form . that the result is an intense horror of cats . there's not much action , but it is very eerie to watch this strange scene . the film is very strong on atmosphere , shot in the style of german expressionism . it is not as strong on plot development or of the story making complete sense . but as a film shot originally as a programmer for universal , this horror film turns out to be a work of true art , and is still one of the best horror films ever made . it is a film of subtle and subversive gestures and one that sets a disquieting mood . this is ulmer's masterpiece , his defining work . "
959,"his rambling story is a near-masterpiece of vision and great perception of what was taking place , as it let go of plot development and storyline , and instead captured the moods , atmosphere , and insights making up the changing landscape in america's unprecedented time of political unrest and social change , as the mostly white middle-class student joined with the black militants demanding that the system change . the explosions take place in slow-motion and pink floyd's "" careful with that axe , eugene "" plays as the products of commercialization go floating by . antonioni wanted to make a film that visually shows that it is a change of attitude inside your head that changes the system and not violence . that if you can't change yourself and are still caught in the consumerism trap , you can't change the way society is driven , you will only change the surface of things . reality is inside your head . it is not by killing off your enemies that you accomplish your aims , but by getting your act together so that you are not part of the problem . it is up to you to make the world a better place to live . she promptly takes off , as antonioni is sending a message that if you think you can escape from the world and your responsibilities by retreating from it , you are mistaken , you only make matters worst . the film originally garnered bad reviews in general and ended up being a commercial failure , subjecting the director to some unfairly harsh criticism . but it was probably the most perceptive film made about that turbulent time , and it is not outdated like most of the critically praised films of that particular genre are when viewed today . "
960,"he feels compelled to always have a gun , as it makes him feel important . but in this expressionist-like opening scene , it is shown that bart will have little chance of overcoming his obsession . it now becomes a road movie of a crime spree , or a love-on-the run film . bart comments : "" two people dead , just so we can live without working ! "" the swamp was used because this low-budget film couldn't afford the money to pay extras and the swamp scene would require only a limited cast . as film noir , this hard-boiled story is much superior to the more popular and more critically acclaimed "" bonnie and clyde , "" which covered the same territory story-wise : amour fou- the running away together by lovers . this fast-action film , with its typically notorious femme fatale depicted , is subversive to the nth degree . he complimented films of this kind by endearingly calling them , "" perceptive trash . "" whatever weakness the story had as it waivered between art and entertainment , and even if it was acted by not the most accomplished of actors , yet there was a raw innocence about it creating a special kind of appeal to those who could feel its lively pulse beating to their resentment of the establishment . "
961,"nicholas ray's exotic pyschological and neurotic western , in which he covers his usual outsider theme but in a western that doesn't feel like any other . it feels as if freud wrote the script and everyone's sexual motivations were constantly being psychoanalyzed . it was almost as if the film was a parody of a western , humorously examining what a man and a woman are supposed to be like , while playing games with the western conventions . it also could be thought of as a political allegory , a critical reaction to the witchhunt of mccarthyism taking place at the time , of the senator's self-righteous attacks on those he didn't like and for going after others for reasons of guilt by association . nicholas ray was so enamored with mercedes' manic performance , he called it straight "" sulphuric acid . "" the film opens in stunningly beautiful trucolor , as johnny guitar is crossing the mountainous terrain and the mesas , and the pastel colors of that scenery comes across as particularly striking . the mannerisms of all concerned are weird , to say the least , especially for a western film . no western has ever had female leads with twisted personalities such as in this one and a psychopathic drifter as its sort of reluctant hero . i think i saw that heroic bit on one of those roy rogers movies , so this is a western after all ! there was a lot in this western to digest , and most of it is in its relentless use of sexual symbolism . "
962,"a precious and unnerving thriller , one that never fails to offer some kind of hitchcockian surprise , as the film is unpredictable throughout . but harry is troubled by this and refuses to release the tapes to anyone but the director . this somber thriller is a beauty , projecting a maddening character study , and infiltrating a secretive and cold world , where the protagonist , a private wire-tapper , has lost his sense of direction , knowing that one's privacy can so easily be exposed by expert technicians like himself and be used for any purpose . the acting was magnificent on all parts , the story was grippingly told , and its denouement , is the equal of the best thrillers ever made . a unique film , whose great sound track by walter murch , is essential to the plot , as the technology in the film was the key element in setting-up the very eerie atmosphere and bleakness associated with a technology used so despairingly . the film is even more relevant today than it was back in the 1970s , as the world has become even more so of a place where it is possible for technology to invade the privacy of any citizen . "
963," laura  is an elegant but campy b&w "" who-dun-what , "" noted for its witty dialogue and exquisite romantic atmosphere among the upper-class society types being confronted by a detective from the proletarian-class . this didn't stop the constant bickering between otto and darryl , as the studio head wanted john hodiak for the dana andrews part , and he did not want newcomer clifton webb in the villain role , nor did he want first-time cinematographer joseph la shelle to do the photography for the film . it is a good thing otto won his argument , because his choices all did great jobs , and webb , lashell , and preminger all received oscar nominations , with only the cinematographer winning . it should also be noted that jay dratler , samuel hoffenstein , and betty reinhardt , were nominated for best screenplay . the french reviewers in the 1940s were the first to call this kind of dark thriller , a noir film . it is one of six or so films they named , such as "" the maltese falcon . "" he is a ruggedly handsome , muscular type , who speaks in the common-man's vulgar tongue as compared with the snobbish effete lingo of waldo . the sexual nature of the three suspects seems perverse , as homosexual aspects to their character furtively emerges in their mannerisms . the film brought out the following observable things about the suspects : ann seems more masculine than feminine , shelby appears to have stereotypical "" gay "" tendencies , while waldo is a flaming bitch ; as they all exhibit , in the very least , a certain amount of sexual ambiguity . what it all boils down to , is melodramatic , leading up to a maddening conclusion , as the prissy he-men , who both seem to be oddly sexually attracted to laura , become the two most likely suspects . what made this a special film , a classic , was how stylishly smart it was and the magnificent performances of both andrews and webb . the former's performance being done with a subtle wink of an eye , was stolid , steadfast , and no-nonsense , complementing the caustic performance of webb , who is viewed as someone ailing from a pygmalion complex . also adding to the film's aesthetics , was preminger's impassive direction , allowing the audience to become voyeurs , with his direction offering no resistance for them seeing whatever they have to about these characters ; and , finally , there is the arresting cinematography of la shelle , creating a moody atmosphere and a mise-en-sc ? ne that is provocatively twisted . it is hard to find fault with this very satisfying seductive thriller . the film even had a great theme song , written by david raksin especially for the film , which takes the same name as the title . "
964,"but the fireworks between the lovers is only beginning , as both feel betrayed and unsure of what to do . the magic in the film is in the chemical reaction between garfield and lana , their performances are sizzling . the reason the film is so provocative , is that it hits below the belt , where the lovers were most vulnerable . he has gone too far afield to evoke any sympathy for his plight . "
965,"his films are noted for not being linear narratives and for examining people who are in a state of moral decay . the film opens with a quote from pushkin , "" even if you kill me , there will be no trace of me , only the devil will be going round and round in circles . "" the content of his film usually overrides its style , at times he seems to care very little how his film looks . this film is a minor transformation for him , there is some effort to make the film seem more stylish . this all indications point to these arguments taking place over a long period of time . conversations are so tense , there seems to be no hope for them . all these characters are emotionally distraught , suffering from jangled nerves and loneliness . this is a tough film to watch , but if you want to see something introspective , something that has a rawness to it that is uncompromising , then this existential-like film fits the bill . it generates an uncomfortable and uncompromising tension that is very perceptive about the human condition . above all , its message is , you must love someone , which is easier said , than done . the filmmaker subtly asks the question , of all his characters , what is it that you believe in ? "
966,"cohen's song will pop up continuously throughout , giving the film an arty flavor to it , as it also adds to the explanation of the film's despondent theme of a small capitalist against the big capitalist . "" mccabe & mrs . miller "" is an antiwestern western , whose themes of love , gambling , alienation , suffering , death , and capitalism , are as haunting as the cinematography of vilmos zsigmond' beautifully colorful pacific northwest territory is , and as haunting as leonard cohen's ballad is , and as haunting as the moody atmosphere of this winter wonderland of desolation is . the drunken mccabe succeeds by luck : by being at the right spot , at the right time , and not by any skills he might possess . altman's film is strikingly lyrical and perfect in mood ; it is a dreamlike film that is hauntingly memorable , that is magical in scope and sadly touches mccabe's yearnings to find love and a place to put down roots . the result is a poetical western without heroes , that is pathetically witty , where mccabe and mrs . miller's wishful dreams are seen as either foolish romantic notions or drug induced inspirations , ones that never had a chance of coming true . "
967,"an historical fantasy film that took eight years to make . this low-budget independent effort ( it had a whopping budget of about $20 , 000 ) , initiated from an original idea by kevin brownlow . the events are make believe ; the b/w film resembles an orwellian nightmare . this is where this fantasy film begins . it looks as if it is a semidocumentary , with scenes padded for dramatic effect and narrative . the power in the film is from the sheer force of the clash of ideas and the expressions coming forth from the nonprofessional actors . the film allows you the luxury to see things for yourself instead of being spoon-fed what to believe . the result was that seven minutes of the film were cut until recently , when brownlow regained control of the film and milestone released it for the first time in its full version . this scene of euthanasia was done in a most humane manner , by injecting them with poison , it was one of the most powerful and stunning scenes to behold . the filmmakers used mainly original rather than merely authentic costumes and props , and they refrained from using any archival footage , which would have been easy to obtain . they drew most of their sense of history from the 1940s by watching newsreels , but in the film they only used voice-overs from professionals who donated their services and used montages and close-ups to get the 1944 look they wanted . you can say whatever you want about their methods , but when you look at the results you feel the intensity and madness of the drama , it has a curious starkness about it that is very compelling . it had the mark of a true artist's stamp on it , even its amateur production values do not weigh heavily against it . even the ending of the film , as it comes to no particular conclusion , it just ends by allowing this remarkable work to be viewed for what it suggested , shows a confidence that the film accomplished what it set out to do . it certainly took the smugness out of anyone thinking that fascism couldn't surface in a country like england . it showed the final liberation by the americans , as an ironically gruesome scene , where collaborators were rounded up and executed . a call for pacifism , is the clearest message that could be heard from between the lines when all is said and done . "
968,"winstanley is a truly amazing and painstaking account of misery , as it depicts those whose cause is righteous and nonviolent . the narrative is taken from the pamphlet writings of gerrard winstanley , a gentle , christian radical . he sort of resembles a hippie of the 1970s . the film is based on the book by david caute , "" comrade jacob , "" but has been thoroughly reworked by co-directors brownlow and mollo . his unique filming style , his penchant for austerity , his demand for authenticity , his equalizing of all scenes in importance so that no event sticks out from the others , and his inspired devotion toward looking at the past , perhaps hoping to unearth some missing piece in the puzzle of mankind that keeps the modern world from advancing on the past tragedies , gives this film an air of adventure . lacking the necessary dramatics of films that are more accessible to the general public , this film is nonetheless a work of great intrigue and visual beauty . despite being filmed without the benefit of professional actors , the only professional being jerome willis who played general fairfax , this film has a certain solemnity about it that forces its truths to be seen in the face of the actors . it is brownlow's way of filming such misery , a way that records the diggers' sufferings as if it were the official record of what happened , and probably could pass for what is official . this sense of reality is what gives the film its raw power . it's a lesson in history that is re-created from the words of a journal that allows the directors to look back at the past with a sense of reverence . this film acts as a vehicle to understand what the diggers believed and how they lived , and how they justly thought that the earth was made common property for everyone . that everyone born on earth shall be fed by it and that all are equals in the creation . his performance was beautiful . there is no question , this low budget project , the bfi put up seventeen thousand pounds , achieved the maximum in having an authentic look , even showing the rare breeds of animals , of the time . it showed breeds of pigs and chickens that don't exist today but did during the 17th century . the film's cost is about the same as a james bond film's title scene would cost . the film's cinematographer , ernest vincze , like almost everyone in the film , including the directors , worked for nothing . it doesn't pretend to have the answers , but the questions it raises about the ability of mankind to live and work together , is one worth asking . the message of the film might seem naive or confrontational to many , including the marxists , the bourgeoisie , the film critics looking for a more recognizable kind of film to evaluate , and the common man , bored by what he doesn't want to know . but to others , perhaps the more restless in society , not afraid of ideas , there is a freshness in this work that you can't easily shrug off by pointing to the filmmaker's refusal to be more melodramatic . the scenes were acted with conviction and its lack of hollywood type of poshness actually played to its favor , making the action seem more pertinent . their story is not something you can easily forget in the black-and- white framed shots , taken by a hand-held camera , and in their uncompromising idealism squaring off against self-righteous forces that wanted to crush them , afraid of their new visions for mankind . try comparing winstanley to other period films of the commercial variety , and it is hard not to see how much more real and meaningful this film is . if nothing else , at least , it is a hard film to forget . for the poetic dream of winstanley , for an equitable and more reasonable world , one that is not forged by malice and greed : that is a vision the world is still waiting to see actually happen . this film is available on video by milestone .

969,"charlton heston as will penny , gives , arguably , his best performance ever , in this magnificent western on an aging cowboy , a loner , an illiterate , faced with the prospects of a dim future . written and directed by tom gries , who achieved critical but not commercial success with this demanding psychological character study on the hardships of a cowboy's lonely life , one of the most underrated westerns ever made . he never made a film again of the same quality . all the rawhiders give over-the-top performances , with pleasence's one being as maniacal as it gets . the chemistry between heston and hackett was magical . the script captures the nuances and local flavor of the cowboy on the trail in an authentic and moving manner . the direction was superb ; the lucid cinematography added to the splendor of the story . an elegant western , exemplified by truly subtle performances by heston and hackett .

970,"this film was made in mainland china and is one of the great and courageous films of the 1990s . it has been banned in china for its political content , and the director has not had another film of his released overseas . tietou tries to make sense out of what happens to his ordinary family , but he just can't seem to fully comprehend why so much misfortune occurred . "" the blue kite "" is the most acrimonious indictment in a film of chairman mao's regime , that i can recall . the picture best demonstrates how the politics and history of the revolutionary times affect the lives of real people . this provocative film is not a flattering look at the myopic political situation in modern china . it tells of simple truths , emphasizing family life , while it is brilliantly crafted in a most moving way . times are difficult , there is not enough food , but everyone seems happy and there is a sense of strong family ties and a strong comradeship among neighbors . there is also an air of innocence and fun that seems to be contagious . the point of the story is that the bonds between mother and child remain strong , no matter what . this film accurately captured the mentality of those who go along with such acts , those who are brainwashed into always thinking they are right and ignoring all the harm they do to people that might have different opinions than they do , people who just want to live peacefully and have decent lives . it is surprising that this film got out of the repressive clutches of china . it clearly showed the horrors of the human drama inflicted on its subjects , the tremendous portrayal of motherhood by lu liping , and the oppression emanating from the chinese dictatorship . this lyrical film offers an eye-opening experience about recent events there , and probably the only people it can't penetrate , are the maoist international movement , a group that is in self-denial about how tyrannical china is .

971,"a wonderful film . mike leigh's valentine to the theater . this 160-minute musical epic ( just right in length--the film was never dull for a second ) , moves at its own very satisfying speed , enhanced by the magnificent musical arrangements of carl davis and replete with many hilarious episodes ( it's a very funny film ) . it also has an opulent cinematography by dick pope , the eye-pleasing stagework of gary yershon , the just right costumes by lindy hemming and the impeccable performances by all concerned , with special kudos to jim broadbent as the constantly sulking and cranky librettist william schwenk gilbert . leigh makes this into a story about what happens backstage : capturing the arduous process of creating a gilbert and sullivan show from scratch , accurately depicting the petulance of the actors , the reality of the business side of show business , those dreaded rehearsals , and all the delicate balancing of egos that come into play , as the director pushes for the performances he wants . it couldn't be more real or more tempered with total affection for what the actor and writer must go through to get what they want out of their work . it is as good a story about the backstage happenings as any in films , and is so much superior than shakespeare in love , which basically did the same thing last year and was rewarded with an oscar . it was amazingly well done to watch his facial and bodily transformation from one of a grouch to unmitigated joy in an instant , as his love for his work is written all over him . as "" the mikado "" goes into rehearsal , gilbert forcefully directs the play and the actors are just as brilliantly daunting whether rehearsing or cavorting backstage , or performing for an audience . one of leigh's pet themes over the years , is for actors to do improvisations . his meaty part couldn't be played to greater perfection , in a performance that is memorable , making it difficult not to think of broadbent whenever the name gilbert will now be mentioned . topsy-turvy captured best director and best film honors in the new york film critic awards . but with the success of the mikado , gilbert tells his wife that he can't handle such happiness , "" there's something inherently disappointing about success . "" musicals don't get any better than this offbeat one . he is so sure of what he is doing , the film is so well researched for authenticity without having to put the film in a period straight jacket , that it retains a refreshingly modern attitude despite being properly set in victorian times . the beauty of the film , making it so much more than the typical musical , is that the director caught the environment of victorian society , allowing it to add a socio-historical perspective to the backstage dramatics of the theater people and to the travails of the g & s partnership . this historical perspective was depicted , by flashing the newspaper headline of the death of general gordon and his men in the khartoum massacre on the screen and then the film zeroes in on some actors stuffing themselves on oysters , basking in the bourgeois society the empire has made possible for them and so many others in england . but the director's main point wasn't political as it usually is , he merely wishes to show what a colossal effort it is to put on a stage show and that g & s individually would have undoubtedly found great success alone , but it is only with their collaboration that their success is so magnificent , and that we should be grateful for what their partnership gave the world . i'm also grateful that leigh made this film . i felt just wonderful leaving the theater . i knew that i saw something special . "
972,"a . i . this is one of the great dark comedies of the 1950s . the opening scene is a memorable one . he begins by saying : "" i would like to say a few words about weddings . i've just been through one . "" even the caterer ( leo g . carroll ) , proves to be an unpleasant problem to deal with , as stanley wryly says , "" an experienced caterer can make you ashamed of your house in fifteen minutes . "" "
973,"errol morris knows what he is after in this film and mines it out of his resourceful subject . this hubris is a trait he shares with many idealogues , to a certain degree . he is a tiny , mousy , and loquacious man , someone who compulsively can't stop talking about what he does for a living , which lends a dismal sense of perverse comedy for half the film until his unchecked demeanor began to grate on me and he became overbearing . it is not hard to think of him as a twerp , whose expertise in executions seems to be real enough but who otherwise is a strangely enigmatic man , someone whom it is not possible to really penetrate . he is someone who disturbingly can't think straight about things that most any child would have little trouble with , such as knowing the difference between what is right and wrong . in other words , like the nazis who gave germany more technical efficiency , he is the perfect imitation of them in spirit . yet , he is someone who isn't even aware that he might be a nazi , he has so desensitized himself of any sense of moral consciousness and responsibility for his actions . i think that he had to know when he joined forces with a neo-nazi group what he was doing and what kind of risky political stand he was taking , and that he would be considered part of that hate group of holocaust deniers , that there could be no way he could continue to maintain that he is not an anti-semite and be believed . certainly not by holocaust survivors , who are used in the film to tell what they think of him . to think otherwise , that he is just an innocent fool , would be to deny what is the obvious . earl morris makes documentaries about as good as anyone ever has , tackling subjects that others would shy away from ( this being his seventh feature- some others are-gates of heaven/fast , cheap & out of control/the thin blue line ) . his works are not mere biographies or hollywood driven achievement celluloids , but poetics of the cinema that sing to our inner sense of being , that make us think about the life of the person on film in a way that we most likely wouldn't have thought about them if we had not seen what morris saw and presented us with . this film is no exception and like the director's other works , it's a visual testament to the human spirit , warts and all . in an odd way , because of his individualism , he is even appealing , which makes this a very scary film--as ultimately , it is about how evil flourishes if it goes unanswered . leuchter is disarming when he is talking with love about the equipment he put together and how well it works , and how compassionate he is for those being executed , wishing only for them to have a good execution . for anyone in their right mind to believe such garbage , is beyond comprehension . for anyone to have done what leuchter did and not be an anti-semite himself is , in my opinion , very unlikely . leuchter's tests were diluted too much by going into the depths of the walls , where it would be impossible to find traces of the gas . leuchter became not just a witness at the trial for neo-nazis , which is bad enough , but he also went on the lecture circuit for these holocaust denial revisionist groups , enjoying the neo-nazi groups' affection and applause . all he could say as a rejoinder to his accusers , is that the execution by cyanide is too impractical a method of genocide : "" why didn't the nazis just shoot them all ? "" this documentary offers one of the most pertinent looks at two highly charged emotional subjects : capital punishment and the holocaust , which makes for a devastating comparison . what's also worth noting , is how acceptable and rational leuchter is until the moment the neo-nazis take hold of him . that should give one some food for thought about the american penal system and how it is used to punish offenders . a highly recommended film . "
974,"ghost dog is the seventh feature film , of arguably america's most innovative and underrated director , jim jarmusch . i consider it a shame that one of america's best directors had to get european backers for this film and still receives a better reception abroad than he does in his own country . she then says in a low voice , "" you can have it . i'm finished with it . "" when louie flinches , he says it is better than if we murder you . there is comedy here in the absurdity of the situation even though no one cracks a joke . but , one of the points of the story , is that things that happen don't necessarily make sense , they just happen . reading books is readily accepted by both parties as something that is cool . the assumption is that they both have soul and can talk the black man's rap . the film is much influenced by jean-pierre melville's stylized 1967 gangster masterpiece le samurai , which also quotes an ancient japanese ideology that influenced its hero , though in that film , it is from the book of bushido , which is a fictional work . ghost dog remains for the most part a parody of other movie characters . the film is slow-paced due to the stoppage to read from the excerpts from the hagakure texts by whitaker . it is a movie that is mostly invigorated by forest whitaker's stunning performance of a man who is an icon , who lives by myth alone , whose most memorable statement , is that "" the end is important in all things . "" the most glaring error ghost dog makes , is in his strictly literal interpretation of what he is supposed to do as a samurai warrior . that would have been the true way of a samurai warrior , whose lessons are meant for battle and seem to be easily misinterpreted by someone living so cut off from human contact and without the benefit of a teacher . jarmusch has in all his films displayed an interest of seeing how another culture looks at the american culture , having already shown how hungarians , native americans , and japanese react to seeing america . it now seems to be the turn of the black man , as this film is basically about the forest whitaker character making peace with who he is , and showing that to be an american , it takes more than one culture to influence you , whether it's the mafia men absorbed by cartoons or rap music or poetry , or the director himself , influenced to be a so-called "" hip "" white negro . for jarmusch , america is an exotic place where different cultures uniquely flourish in the most unexpected spots . the shining points of the film come from the moving cinematography of robby muller , the minimalist mise-en-sc ? ne , the splendid expressive performance by forest whitaker , the underlying humor , and the freshness of jarmusch's approach to filmmaking , proving that he is someone willing to take chances . there are critics who constantly rave about less cutting-edge films more than do about ones that are not afraid to mess with set-concepts . for this film , they offer mostly faint and lefthanded praises . as for me , i'll take my chances with heaping praise on a jarmusch near-miss like this one , over so many other forgettable praiseworthy hits that are so limited in scope . jarmusch's first language is poetry and it is my belief that this film is as close to a lyrical masterpiece as a film can be without being one . its weakest point being a lack of character development for the mafia figures , as the mafia characters were more cartoonish than real , they seemed to be created to fit a certain standard mold rather than to be developed out of their own personalities . but that flaw , was also what drove the film comically , therefore making that weakness more palatable and understandable . this film is similar in mood to his other ambitious work , which was a masterpiece , dead man , and it is one that makes so many fine points to justify its wide range of themes . it is foolish to try and tightly categorize it , except to say that even though it is not exactly a mainstream film , neither is it primarily an art-house film . it just might be one of those intriguing films that requires an acquired taste and once acquired , leaves no doubt about how good it is , no matter that there are a few things in it that might be considered tasteless . "
975,"it is visually the best of such films made , a classic study in heroism and in military planning , that stays with the men in battle as they fight for survival and doesn't go off into the politics of why they are there . the aim will be to hold the outside perimeter at all times and reinforce any side that is being attacked . the battle scenes were memorable , the acting was first-class , the director correctly offers no explanation for the why of the battle as the action itself seems to explain the absurdity of their situation . the professional soldiers say , "" we fight because we are here , there is no one else who will fight for us . "" the film offers no explanation about the racial nature of the conflict , as it is played mostly as a story of a courage on both sides . the film does not display a racist attitude . burton announces that there have been 1 , 344 such medal given out overall . chad and bromhead worked well together despite their class differences , with chad showing a natural ability to think fast and act without indecision . there is a certain fascination about this movie that makes it a moving experience , especially in watching the zulus perform under endfield's direction . zulu is presented in such a tough-minded and matter-of-fact way , that it is hard to argue against the way it was filmed . it was also an interesting bit of casting by the co-producers endfield and baker , of having the cockney caine play a stuffy upper class englishman . but it worked ; caine was just splendid , it is still one of his finest hours in film . "
976,"this riveting noir thriller was made on the heels of the kefauver crime hearings in the u . s . senate . bannion has a judgmental thing about women , looking at them as either saints or whores . but , bannion is skeptical , as he is left without any doctor's report as proof . for bannion , this is seen as a hopeful sign that people can change . they don't get much better in noir films than this stark and gritty classic . it has the auteur signature of lang written all over it , with outstanding performances from a cast that puts their stamp of reality on the film . its nihilistic message about humanity is scarring , glenn ford's pyrrhic victory in the end and his restoration to his old job , seems to have a cynical feel to it , meaning that violence and corruption go together in city politics like ham and eggs . this is a dangerous film , its message is not an easy one to receive . "
977,"mckellar goes for the smaller private moments rather than a grand philosophical argument about the meaning of life or a catastrophic special effect ending . the focus of the film isn't on any sort of biblical apocalypse , nor is it on the outside revellers and looters , or on those who gather in the city square to make it a new year's eve celebration , but it is on those who think out what they want to do and plan to spend a thoughtful evening preparing for the end . the wheeler family uses the catastrophe as an excuse to make this a christmas celebration , believing that even if it isn't christmas that day was the most memorable one for the family and the day of the year they most fondly remember . the sardonic humor and clever performances by sandra oh , don mckellar and callum keith rennie , leave a lasting impression . sandra and don make their experiences seem so vitally human , while callum remains the eternal materialist . the premise is a question that many people have asked themselves , as i recall parties where the game played was to say how you would like to die , and the responses were always so varied and revealing . "
978,"this indie film is filled with many gratifying small touches , as it takes its time developing and forces one to tune into the way victor sees things . this is the kind of human interest story that hollywood slicks up and can't make in quite the same realistic way that a good indie film can be made , that takes its time in bringing out a number of small truths , so that by the time the story winds down , a big climactic ending is not needed , all the pain and pathos has already been drawn out of it . in contrast to victor's gentle nature , he's always high-strung . the film works so well because the performers are outstanding and the writer/director has come through with a very touching debut effort . there is something precious about this film , whether in shelley winters warm performance as a giving but possessive mother , or from pruitt taylor vince's priceless performance of someone who hardly speaks and is a doting son , longing for love and friendship , but who still hasn't matured , or from liv tyler's refreshing role as the one who breeds life into the dead feelings of both mother and son , giving them some hope for the future . the musical score arranged by thurston moore helped set the quiet mood needed for the story to gently unfold . everything about this original film was honest and natural . all the characters know what loneliness is , even if they mask it better than the mama's boy does , and because of that , it is easy to relate to their very demanding problems of loneliness and how it has eaten away at them -- making some fat , others blind to what they are , or bitter . "
979,"one of the really haunting films of the 1990s . a film about a life hitting a wall and taking the starch out of a young person's sense of being . it is so painful to see what existence means and doesn't mean to a teenage girl , that it is hard to look at this film without thinking of it as a documentary . its underlying theme is about the impossibility of leading a moral life and being moral , that no matter what one does , existence supercedes everything else . she played the role with conviction and gave a truly unforgettable performance . the dardenne brothers have made an urgent film about today's job market that hits home on its universal pathos and how those on the bottom are taken advantage of by unfair employment practices . it's a theme that forces you to look at the young girl in an introspective way and at her poverty as something that is real and not something that can be dismissed by other distractions in the story . rosetta's life is more reflective of how ordinary americans manage to scrape by and actually exist , than in all the ludicrous themes of the escape films most americans flock to see . this film is rich in all the things about life that hollywood chooses to gloss over in its need to get a blockbuster film . its star does not exude beauty and is not faced with episodic adventures . they have created a masterfully perfect visceral film , that is unflinching in its realism and unsentimental in its study of her . what makes this film so uncompromising and ironical , is that we are not asked to like or even accept rosetta , we are only allowed to understand that she does what she has to in order to exist . isn't that the way life really is , anyway ? i found a job , you got a job . i got a friend , you got a friend . i will not fall in a rut , you will not fall in a rut . i will lead a normal life , you will lead a normal life . in many ways , her story is ours , there are no national borders to separate us from such agony . there is nothing more important for most people in the world than in securing a job , and there are very few films that take the pains to show that getting a job is so serious a matter . i think that the film critics who downplayed this film into the minor category because of its lack of action and tedium , missed a chance to see a film that had much more to offer than the usual type of escapist entertainment fare . this film has the distinction of being troublingly unique , it is devoid of any philosophy , it is even different from bresson's "" mouchette , "" a masterful film it is most closely akin to . bresson had too many religious and catholic agendas in his film to achieve the starkness this film does . this is a film made for purists of the cinema , those who don't want to see another disposable film , but who wish to see a film that is unmistakably direct , a film that they can see themselves in if they are not too calloused and frightened of life to look at the dark side . it is society's mistake if they make someone like rosetta invisible , and it is our mistake as filmgoers and critics if we ignore films just because they bring up unpleasant subjects and we don't feel entertained by them . to be so prosaic in our viewing habits as that , we would be on the same slippery footing as rosetta , striving for the same kind of ridiculous normalcy she was after . "
980,"a marvelously compelling documentary , even if it seems rigged when it isn't , as everything fits so smoothly together due to the efficiency of the filmmakers . the boxing and real-life experiences are equally covered in a spellbinding fashion , as the n . y . u . it is the same storefront gym that produced riddick bowe and where mike tyson worked out , so success has already touched some who climbed out of this slum . the lanky noel gives it his best shot , but just doesn't have the skills to advance in the golden gloves . tyrene runs into some hardluck and her story is really the pivotal one in the film . life is tough in bed-stuy and no matter what some supposedly well-meaning liberals say about the violent nature of the sport , for some , it is a way out of their predicament . it takes courage to go in the ring and try to prove yourself , it also takes some kind of instinctual intelligence to be a successful fighter , and that might be the best skill these three aspiring boxers have going for them . boxing might be their best chance of succeeding in life and i see no reason why they shouldn't be given that opportunity . this was a wonderfully intense documentary . the full impact of what i saw only hit home with a wallop when i thought about the film afterwards . the filmmakers were unobtrusive and totally professional , as technically it doesn't get much better than this . "
981," the thing  was long suspected of being directed by howard hawks--much later on this was confirmed by the actors . this is one of the better science-fiction cheapie films , one that became a cult classic . it is a wonderfully banal film about a flying saucer landing on the north pole and a superior alien , who looks like frankenstein , being thawed out . hawks wastes no time with any liberal messages about why this creature came here , instead the film has a jovial air force crew snappily banter at each other , a sparring romantic relationship develop between the womanizing captain and the scientist's independent-minded secretary cut through the fierceness of the monster story , and for quirkiness , we see plants as monsters crying for more blood to spawn more monsters . the cast is perfect , their non-chalant attitude gives the film its raucous mood and allows the warlike atmosphere between beast and man to be a battle of both wits and brawn . but the air force is only interested in the safety of everyone concerned and see no redeeming value in communicating with the alien . nikki snaps back , "" you boil it . "" then , as an ironic twist , the monster cuts off the heat in the building . but carrington has gone crazy , clammoring "" i want to understand it , "" and has shut off the generator . the film closes with the excited scottie breaking the story to the world , screaming into the microphone : "" i bring a warning--to every one of you listening to the sound of my voice . tell the world , tell this to everyone wherever they are : watch the skies , watch everywhere , keep looking--watch the skies ! this is a fast-paced and enjoyable b-film , giving us a feel for the cold war paranoia taking hold of the country at the time . it is about how anyone different is viewed as an enemy , and how there is a sense of isolation for intellectuals in the country . "
982,"dariush mehrjui is one of iran's finest modern filmmakers , his speciality is making films about relationships among the upper-middle-class illuminati , and especially love stories about women . this drama is a very powerful , poignant and mesmerizing love story , about the pressures of dealing with moslem traditions and of a woman's own sense of being . why this marriage should turn ice cold , when everything is so blissful , is amazing to watch as it unfolds . this is a truly heartbreaking tale without contrivances , that examines a woman's psyche , looking carefully at her wants and her expectations . reza is never forceful enough in his statements telling her that it doesn't matter that she can't have children , as leila has nagging doubts about whether he really means it or is just saying it . the couple have all the creature comforts of modern life and act like modern people do , and are seen playfully watching dr . zhivago on tv together , but tradition is also very strong . this is a very compelling and subtle film , on one hand it shows the current conflict in iran between modernity and islamic tradition , but on the other hand , this is a penetrating film about the universal problem of love , as seen through the psyche of a woman who is stripped of her self-esteem , and even though she is beautiful and has a considerate husband , she is still not sure of what her role is in society . this is a very sensitive tale ; it is film that was convincing in every possible situation it presented ; it is the work of a great director . "
983,"this is the director akira kurosawa's international breakthrough film , garnering many awards , including hollywood's 1952 best foreign language film oscar and the golden lion award , at the 1951 venice film festival . rashomon became incorporated into the everyday language , and japanese films became a regular part of the western world's film culture mainly because of this film . the strength of the film lies in its attempt to show how the search for the truth is laden with traps , as all four narrators of the horrid event depicted are supposedly telling the truth according to what they believe they saw but their truths still turn out to be veiled in mystery . in the intellectual scheme of this puzzler , kurosawa determines that the truth cannot be found because 'the truth is relative . ' the film is blemished only by kurosawa's backtracking at the conclusion , coming up with an unconvincing and hokey humanistic ending to counter his more potent argument that everyone lies for selfish reasons . what makes the film special besides its interesting philosophical theme , is the high-powered performances , especially the one by toshiro mifune as the manic bandit tajomaru , and in the frenetic movements of the camera ( whether slow or fast paced ) and the way it captured the intensity of the film , giving it its sense of urgency . this was a unique filming device used by kurosawa , of zooming in on the character when telling his or her version , as each had a different rhythm that the camera underscored by revealing the particular mood of the storyteller . the common man is not surprised that mankind is selfish , as he takes a cynical view of humanity , anyway , listening to the story as if it's just a typical murder one . the woman's version is quite different , as each narrator tells a version that makes them look good . there was no duel . she asks the court , what should a poor , defenseless woman like me do ? he says he almost forgave the bandit for acting honorable at that point . all three participants are shown to have poor character . the truth is subjective and can't be believed in its entirety because of each narrator's ego . this contrived ending is supposed to show that there are still those who will unselfishly reach out to help others . the film has not aged that well , though it seems to still be a powerful picture but , in my opinion , not the masterpiece it was once thought of . i think the same reevaluation will take place of kurosawa's long and distinguished career and he will be downgraded from being crowned as a great director to a very good one . he seems to suffer in most of his films from too much sentimentality and contrivances , though his strong filming techniques and very muscular camera work , as exhibited in this film , will remain his ultimate trademark . "
984," beach red  undoubtedly had a positive influence on two recent world war 11 films that had the same theme , terrence malick's "" the thin red line ( 98 ) "" and steven spielberg's "" saving private ryan ( 98 ) , "" only cornel wilde's film is the more powerful and impactful one , dissecting the fighting marine in one of the most alluring allegories made about the futility of war . spielberg's overall work pales in authencity besides it , even the landing on the beach scene , which wilde depicted in just as gory a way , holds its own with "" saving private ryan . "" while malick's film suffered from too many pretentious moments of philosophizing and did not have the same authentic personal touches that wilde's film had . the film will work its way through all the action scenes by highlighting four soldiers , who generally are reflective of all the marine's views . it uses the clich ? s about these men to push its story further , going past the clich ? s , to eventually show the bigger picture and ask the bigger question of why there is war . the men are heard thinking aloud , in much the same way malick used this device in his film but here it seems more natural and was done some 30 years before he did it . what also helps give this film a very real look , is that the men come across as soldiers trying to act rather than actors trying to be soldiers . this brilliant , subtle film , connects war with the everyday attitudes of mankind , as it penetrates the soul of those in combat , seemingly , better than most films of this genre . it's a film whose voiceovers of how the men think hit deeply on the emotions of its subjects , also its use of flashbacks are superbly utilized , and its brutal coverage of the war itself has the force to show what combat must have felt like . this neglected war film is as rough and tumble as any sam fuller film , as poignant a reflection of the racial divides in the military as any ww11 film made before the 1960s , and it leaves a lasting impression that is both haunting and expansive . when cornel wilde says , "" that the trouble with killing , is that after awhile we forget why we are doing it , "" we see how the film has the resourcefulness to deal with both its pacifist message and with the certain primitive rawness it portrays , that gives it that uncertain edge all influential picturesneed . "
985,"this is one terrific musical , outdated or not . the song and dance numbers are playful , the story is meaningful , the performances are marvelously refreshing , and the plush settings are very colorful . it is a film that borrows freely from the hollywood musical , but adds its own very french touch of romantic spice , allowing the film to spring forth with a burst of vibrancy . the film's musical score is an easy one to remember by michel legrand , and its story is told almost exclusively by song , with lyrics by demy . johann sebastian bach is also brought into the musical picture in a most revered way . the spirited choreography caught my fancy , even though it probably was not as perfect as jerome robbins would do , but it was a good enough imitation that was attempted by norman maen . it is a film where music is everywhere , when a fair comes to town , the pedestrians suddenly break out in a dance number , giving the film an odd but potent touch of reality , as the film does not aim for plausibility . everything about this film was hopping , there were no dead spots . as in his other romantic films , demy points out that love depends more on chance and good timing than anything else . her gruesome murder is made into a jolly song , continuing with the upbeat mood of this surreal film . everything seems to work , no matter how awkward , there was just so much energy and good chemistry , that mistakes were made unimportant . i simply loved it for its vitality , realizing that if i saw it in the 1960s , i might not have been so taken with its lack of political perception . it was a film that had bad timing for its release date , it was the wrong time to pay homage to hollywood musical films , such films were already passe and revolution was in the air and in the arts , and this film was just an anamoly . "
986,"an unusual film from the always interesting director takeshi kitano ( fireworks/violent cop/sonatine ) , taking an entirely different direction than the violent gangster films he is renown for . the dialogue is almost completely muted , as there are long stretches of golden silences and no translators for the deaf are used or needed to make things understood . the couple communicates by their expressions , rarely using sign language . it is a most compelling and unique film , one that is emotionally satisfying , on a level of a bresson film for its sparseness and the emotional connections it makes with the viewers . they go to a spot where a regular crowd of surfers hang-out , and while shigeru is learning , the others laugh at his inexperience and lack of proper equipment , he doesn't even possess a wetsuit . there are some splendid scenes where we view him at a surfing contest , the chikura surf classics . there is little need for dialogue to convey its story , for what is clearly shown is how human nature can be understood by deaf people , that one does not need language to express how people cling to groups and glorify their own exclusiveness . the film always has a light strain of humor running through it , yet what remains memorable , is how beautiful the summer scenery is and how effectively simple the story is , molded together in a very discriminating way while presenting a very touching love story . this is a cinema fans true delight , a purely visual film without the need for high-tech artifices .

987,"cameron crowe ( say anything . . . /singles/jerry the film is not raucous rock , but offers a sweet view of the music world , pointing out why its popularity is high among adolescents , while also exploring its business side . the casting was perfecto , not that the acting was necessarily arresting , but it was that everyone seemed natural for their roles and gave expression and a sense of truth to what was happening . all you can do is write about them honestly . that will be the mantra of the film and also its hardest attack on the industry , but it is carried out to perfection by this great cast and directed with a sure-hand for drawing out the comedy and whatever goodness there is in the artists and the groupies who follow them . but the film will go on to show that everyone connected with the music is delusional , the musicians are not as serious about their music as they pretend to be and the "" band aids "" are only fooling themself if they think they're not groupies , as they stroke their unsatisfied egos by basking in the glory of someone else . he , thusly , fails to heed lester's advise . what i thoroughly enjoyed about the film was the casual way it let its characters act and be themselves , even if it was rehashing characters and rock music scenes played out in many such films , but here it seemed to be very easy to absorb and take in without dissecting that 1970s hippie scene . instead , it let the story make whatever sense it could without going overboard . i doubt very much if the film caught the full-flavor of that period , but it did catch what it had to , and all the characters avoided falling into being stereotypes . billy crudup is a very fine actor and he is able to be different things to different people in this film without making it seem as if he were disingenuous . the film might not have been flawless , with some mild lapses in character development ( groupies were thinly sketched ) and the story resolvement was not convincing ( a contrived bumpy plane landing scene , where the band fearing death confess what they really think of each other ) , but the overall zeal of the film overtakes those gaffs and allows the film to be much better than being merely a nostalgia film , and much more entertaining than any serious rock film i have seen . cameron crowe seems to have found a niche in making teen films that are much better than teen films . he seems to have an ageless sympathy for teenagers and for those who teens idolize , not categorizing them as either good or bad people . also , this film is suitable for both parents and kids , r rating or not , which is not an easy chore to accomplish when making a hip film . but moms should like it , as the frances mcdormand characterization was more eccentric and mannered than one-dimensional , and after all , the kid listened to her and didn't take any drugs ( at least it wasn't shown in the story ) . "
988,"it has a cast of attractive and famous stars , and was a box-office hit in europe , but is a film that has received very little notice in america . it is a return to form for the 83-year-old master , who in his last film ever , is able still to put his recognizable signature of post-modern style on the work ( now considered old-fashioned ) , even if it is hard to imagine how he directed while under such a handicap . there is a quiet and easy pace that allows the stately film to be properly absorbed as a meditational exercise comparing the similarities of the spiritual , erotic and aesthetic world , and could be viewed by many as an end of an era work that is both enthralling and bound to rub some the wrong way for its politically incorrect moments . but to just ignore this film and give it no venue to be shown , is a slap in the face of one of the world's greatest directors . i thankfully got a chance to see it on the sundance cable channel . wim wenders is around to connect the dots in the stories , direct the opening airplane prologue and the epilogue ( his filming style is noticeably flat when compared to antonioni's ) . the film has the appearance of pretentiousness because the stories all appear slight and the voiceover by malkovich doesn't seem to add much flavor to the stories . yet it isn't pretentious . there is an intensity about the way the master's camera captures the stories that give his silence and his sometimes unsatisfyingly sophomoric dialogue an opening for ideas to be filtered through , making the sheer beauty of the mise en scene something not less than breathtaking . john malkovich plays antonioni , a director traveling around italy and france looking for characters and ideas for a film . explaining what he is about as a director , malkovich lays it on thick by stating "" i only discovered reality when i began to photograph it . "" he further muses , "" the only thing i do in my films is try to discover what's behind the photographs . "" the two make love , but casually depart as they can't seem to make a more demanding connection . again , the beauty in the story , as in all the tales , is in the photography , showing this bare materialistic apartment , surrounded by the icy steel colored interior , filled only with a black leather lounge chair and a piece of art valued only as a decoration piece , visually telling you more about the couple than words could ever . on the surface , the story appears like a conventional bedroom farce . there is also a light comic scene , which seems to be thrown in as a joke at the director's expense , as the late marcello mastroianni is an artist on a country hillside copying a cezanne masterpiece and jeanne moreau is laughingly mocking him for not trying to do his own thing . in none of the tales , is there an easy explanation for what attracts them or prevents them from being lovers . it is in the enigma of what it is the lover's want or why they are compelled to want certain things , that makes this a fascinating film , one of the great ones , even when there is the occasional uncomfortable voyeuristic feeling it might leave the viewer with , as the power of antonioni's work rattles under the skin and he doesn't help by giving you any answers , such as if it is easier to go after what one desires no matter or for one's desire to remain unfulfilled and for one to make the best of it . this a work of great care and imagination , an erotic film that moves modern cinema closer to the edges of pornography than it would care to admit , and it leaves room for many ways to look at love , which might be the baton he is passing on to the younger directors . "
989,"this low-budget western appealed to both stars because it was really a homage to their careers , as they would be playing aging gunmen , an extension to the many different characters they played in their long film life--where their combined film total must be over a few hundred . because of their terrific acting skills and peckinpah's stylish direction , this film turned out to be a classic , one of the better westerns made . this is one of peckinpah's more appealing films , it is visually stunning , fully capturing the gorgeous mountain landscapes and comparing it with the more gaudy view in the modernized town . it is also peckinpah's warmest portrait he paints of a woman's sufferings in any of his films , as one can only feel pity for the anguish the sexually repressed hartley has by living in such a backward frontier settlement . "
990,"roman polanski sets up a tense atmosphere for this macabre tale , where every black-and-white shot is subjectively motivated by the deranged character played with quiet brilliance by catherine deneuve , until the final shot becomes one of objective reality . the only thing to be said in favor of these ghastly murders are that these men were not nice and were extremely pushy , wanting to use her and not caring that she didn't even show the slightest interest in them . this is an austere and timeless grand guignol work , one with little dialogue . this is the first of roman polansky's english language film's and his second feature ( the first was "" knife in the water "" -1962 ) , and this one might be his best work . it is eerie , unsettling and intelligently created , showing deneuve's emotional breakdown in an impactful way , by showing it in psychological terms of deterioration and not as a creation of special effects . this is a scary film , one of the best in the world of horror films . "
991,"it has become a cult favorite , and i thought it was far superior to the other two films . there are no over-the-top performances and no unnecessary gore shown , yet it is a nightmarish voyeristic look at a criminal hunter going after his prey by looking inside himself for answers . what director-writer michael mann does well , is build suspense through the serious characterizations . the actors speak in muted tones , while in the background , the pulsating soundtrack of bands such as red 7 , shriekback , and iron butterfly , set the chilling mood . dante spinotti's photography is beautifully effective in making the urban and country landscapes fit so well into the tenseness of the storytelling , while the widescreen is the perfect way to see this original thriller . brian cox's performance is simply brilliant , his hannibal is a most intelligent and frightening one , superior to anthony hopkins' campy portrayal of hannibal in the other versions . also , this scene was brilliantly filmed , as it was perfectly framed , showing in frightful details the similarity and gulf between these two antagonists , as they converse while in different cells . the stylish photography in this final scene , features mirrors , paintings , images , reflections , lunar landscapes , all pointing to the killer's urge to kill because he needs to be wanted and desired . this is an overlooked but superior horror film , one of the best films from the 1980s . the director's cut video has been released to coincide with the opening of hannibal . "
992,"it's a grim tale filled with nostalgia , tenderness , and grief . the arrangement blossoms as jerry enjoys taking care of them and acting fatherly to the little girl . penn is to be commended for his nuanced shooting of the film and his confident way of telling the story through a retired detective who is becoming mentally unbalanced , and in the ambiguous ending that makes the viewer resolve the story as he thinks it should be . penn has directed a superb film , that is interestingly photographed and brings out fine performances from this sterling cast . many cast members gave cameo performances that fit the grey mood of this very emotionally felt film . it's one of the better murder mystery stories made , one that is more a psychological study of the detective than of the killer . it is more pertinent as a character study than as a murder investigation . "
993,"one of the great silent films of all time . it was also one of the most offbeat psychological dramas ever produced by a major studio , especially one such as mgm . the collaboration between director/writer tod browning , himself a one time circus performer , and the intense performance by lon chaney , was a thing of magic . this was a vengeful , gruesome and scary scene . "" the unknown "" is a tightly made film , with a sinister plot and a startling and intense performance by chaney . the film presents an excellent study of character , though its theme is morbid and boiling with hatred it is still appealing because of its edginess . "
994,"a top-notch film noir about the loneliness and despair in tinseltown , which is more a weighty drama story than a murder mystery . dix's idea of knowing you are in love is making breakfast for his girl , hardly a poetical romantic notion but more of the notion of love the common man might have . it's the kind of temperament that could swing across the pendulum from a loving warmth to an insane rage . dix is not a very pleasant noir character ; he's someone trapped in his dark emotions , left in a lonely place where he can't work out his problems and can only be viewed as someone who is too alienated to make positive relationships . i died when she left me . i lived a few weeks while she loved me . "" "
995,"an outstanding melodrama . it's a film noir that is influenced by freudian psychology , and was shot in 18 days by otto preminger . the result was that this was arguably her best film performance and otto , a known bully to actors , came up with an intelligent and exciting thriller . the film scores big because of the great nuanced performances from the stars robert mitchum and simmons , the sharp black and white photography contrasting the wealthy estate to mitchum's humble stature and rosy dreams , that the tale of obsessive love was credibly presented , and the typical noir tale of the protagonists getting hooked on sex and money gave the film the dark energy it thrived on . "
996,"this is an unsentimental and marvelously acted family drama , set in a backwater dumpy australian seacoast town . the script by laura jones is intelligent and pertinent , the woman director gillian armstrong ( my brilliant career ) has made a nearly flawless film , and the three lead actresses draw out their complicated characters in ways that touch the heart with the mark of unbridled reality . the film doesn't flinch and tells the story without leaving a way out for any of the parties involved . it shows that a mother doesn't have to be perfect , she can have flaws as almost all do , but there's something about a child being raised by her real mother that means so much to both . there are no easy answers given here , what the film does best is concentrate on how this accidental meeting has a devastating effect on all three lives and it does it in a fresh way . judy davis is one of the best actresses around today , and her performance is powerful . this is just a brilliant film , my only quibble with it is a minor one . "
997,"a top-rate film noir from the master , alfred hitchcock , that is more or less a twisted tale about love . it's also more erotic than the usual hitchcock ones , as long kissing scenes are duly noted . in fact , one scene was supposedly "" the longest kiss onscreen in the history of films , '' taking three minutes in all . it was not , however , a single kiss , but broken up in three second intervals as censors observed . this memorable scene is in a class with the final one in casablanca . "
998,"a brilliant and moving indie drama filmed on a shoestring budget of $400 , 000 , money allocated from the actors guild . maze mentioned that if he had to do it again , he would use guerrilla techniques allowing him to have a less glossy look but he would now have the ability to edit daily and reshoot scenes . as far as i could tell , there is only the abrupt happy ending i would expand on . otherwise , the film had an honest tension to it that made all these one take scenes seem honest , fresh and gripping . the film has not been released as of yet , but has been going around to film festivals . i saw it at the williamstown festival . that is the fifth and probably last festival it will play , as it either must find a distributor after a year of festivals or risk the possibility of never getting released . he mentioned that some cable tv networks might be interested in it if the nude scenes are removed . this prompted maze to jest that the film in order to get a release could be retitled "" blind babe's boobs "" in imitation of a hong kong film . whether it's acting or his life experience speaking , he is very genuine in this role and draws a very deep picture of someone losing a grip on himself . the film looked great because of its photography , its script was well thought out and intelligently done , and even though the actors were not household names they were all superb . marvel is known as an intellectual actress , someone who usually works in the theater and has garnished obie awards . incidentally , marvel and camp have a real-life longtime romantic relationship . this is a deeply emotional film with many complex layers to it , it is the kind of film that hollywood can't make because they believe there isn't an intelligent audience out there that want to see films like this one . that is precisely why such a heavy and intense film like this one , that takes risks and is unafraid that it does not fit into a niche market , deserves to be critically recommended so that it gets noticed by some distributor and has the possibility to reach a demanding audience that craves such worthy films . it is easily one of the better films i have seen this year . "
999,"at last , a black comedy , coming-of-age , romantic melodrama about teenagers in rebellion that is not a formulaic clich ? d one and actually makes an attempt to flesh out the character of a teen who is searching for something that is not trivial , as she lashes back at being stuck in the urban sprawl scene of la that is inhabitated by so many shallow and phony people . it's filmed by documentary filmmaker terry zwigoff , a nerd himself , who gave us the excellent documentary crumb . she promises much to enid and , as one might expect , delivers little . it is one that seymour is willing to have even if it means he has to compromise all his beliefs to keep it going , as he curiously says "" i don't want to meet someone who shares my interests . i hate my interests . "" through his unapologetic loneliness she sees her own , and even though this film is not geared for a predictable or a happy ending , it's this relationship with all its incongruities that is so fascinating , touching and tender to behold . it certainly sharpened their awareness of who they were , and the poetical ending is fitting for a free flowing story like this one . i honestly can't remember how long its been since i have seen a teenage film as memorable as this one ( rushmore comes the closest ) . "
1000,"a truly magificent and authentic film set in the sparsely populated mountainous region of dolpo in northwest nepal . its appeal is both visually and in its compelling story about the tibetan villagers who live by their traditions . the cast is made up of mostly non-professionals who have not only not acted before , but some have never even seen a film . their wonderful expressive faces are reflective of the mountains and give the film its very appealing look . himalaya is noteworthy for its breathtaking shots of mountains that scale as high as 10 , 000 feet , as valli daringly shot this almost impossible mountain trek for nine months in all kinds of conditions--including a blinding winter snowstorm . it was shot in cinemascope using wide-angle panoramic framed shots and was nominated for an oscar as best foreign film , but lost to pedro almodovar's all about my mother . the story in its simplicity can be viewed as a fable about a generational conflict between a stubborn religious traditionalist set in his ways versus the younger man who is influenced by the pragmatism of modern ways and is just as pigheaded as his opponent . the film becomes in its second half an amazing visual spectacle and a challenge to the filmmaker to record the earnest story in the most difficult of locations , as it follows the two parties through the barren highland valleys and unsafe mountain passes . it's a testament to the spirit and courage of these followers of tibetan culture , who strive to carry on the traditions . it's ultimately a film about finding out who you are and about living in harmony with nature . i enjoyed it immensely and believe this rare film will be remembered for the simplicity of its very human story and the deep respect it has for a way of life that is endangered . if it wasn't a more penetrating look at the nepal villagers and their superstitions and if the drama wasn't more subtle--so be it ! that might be the task of another filmmaker . what this film did was show us a way of life that few have ever witnessed , and it did it in a spirited pictorial manner . "
1001,"it is about the effects of war on some taiwanese patriots and appears to be inaccessible until it slowly becomes clear what the masterful director is up to . the story is multi-layered as it uses as its theme the crimes against citizens during the anti-communist campaign waged during the 1950s , giving it a complexity that requires the viewer to have a resolve to stick with this gloomy tale that is shot with a static camera and takes place in three different time periods ( past , present , and in the imagination ) . the reward is seeing a great bit of filmmaking that comes from the heart . this is being enacted in a film starring liang ching . as the red army fought for control of china , chiang kai-shek -- supported by the americans -- rooted out all communists by force . the movie's title she's in is : good men , good women . the film offers much to ponder about the lessons from the past and how rotten both sides can be during war . it's a smoothly accomplished film of a 'film within a film , ' as it uses memories that are personal and those that are part of history to show how we can't easily distinguish the two . by the film's conclusion we feel the personal loss of both men who were killed , even though one might have been an innocent victim and the other might have got what he deserved . it's an unusual film that is always challenging and intelligent . annie shizuka inoh in the role of these women from different generations , gives an inspiring performance that evokes a genuine sympathy . "
1002,"how could i have imagined as i was making this film that the stifling sense of longing that fills the screen was to become my lot for the rest of my life ; that from now until the end of my days i would bear the painful malady within myself ? "" for that reason , seeing how the filmmaker himself was pleased with the film and considered it so important to himself , and because of the power and perfection of craft the film exhibited , it makes it that much easier for me to say that this film ranks as one of his best works , an intriguing masterpiece , that is equal to , if not better than his other masterpieces , solaris , andrei rublyov , the sacrifice , and mirror . the visual images of all the scarved peasant ladies with lit candles and starlings coming out of the virgin's body are , indeed , startling . the mood of the film is gloomy , when a laugh is heard or someone does something silly it is monumental and takes on an unreal scope . the feeling one gets , is somewhat as if a child , saddened by the outside world , is nevertheless able to laugh at something he makes up , and thereby feels good about himself . when the sacristan's response is , "" what are you here for , then ? "" the best and truest lines in the film are spoken by the madman . the people are much like the weathermen who can give you the temperature , but are lost when the conversation takes a deeper turn , they are simply not prepared to talk about what they do not comprehend . for tarkovsky , this film is a lifetime journey , made by someone who is in pain and must see this pain through for what it is , because there is no going ahead without taking this pain with him . things do not seem so foreign to him , anymore . "
1003,"melville establishes his exquisite control of the subject matter by allowing the story to unfold in such a perfect manner . i suspect , not many directors have that kind of grace and understanding of life . . . melville's sense of how to tell a story has influenced many directors through his long career starting in the late 40s , and that list would include the great director , bresson , who developed the same style and feel for filmmaking as melville , who at times outdoes melville's melville , giving some the false impression that melville imitated bresson . melville's success comes through the intelligent use he makes of his eye for seeing what is spiritual and what is intelligent , and allowing it to be emotionally compelling . his argument for a god couldn't be put forth with more verve and intelligence , even though it didn't convince me , as he was not challenged with counter arguments by any one in the film who had the ability to present a cogent differing opinion , nevertheless , this film moved me to further expand what i think . . . it even shows that it is possible to have a truly spiritual person be a part of the church , something that i have rarely come across outside the cinema . "
1004,"goldfish , for the iranian celebrants , are symbols of life . what is truly amazing about this masterly done film , is how gracefully it uses real time to take you into the countdown for the new year , that is marked off by repeated radio reminders . by this time , we are sucked into accepting the importance the money and goldfish has for the girl , it is not unlike our christmas time desire to please our children with gifts , whether or not the gifts are worth it or not , they have an intrinsic value above their real worth , and we feel so happy when we see the joy in their eyes when they receive their gifts . the brilliance of the film , is that the story that unfolds is about the little girl's adventure with the shop owners and the strangers in the street she is not supposed to talk to but does , and how caught up in it we get because it is so human a story ; it is something that is universally understood , that we forget that we are talking about iran , the country that we demonized , our arch enemy ; and , if the film can be criticized , it is for glossing over any of the numerous wrongs in their society that could be criticized but are not . though , i think , that might be unfair to say , since the movie should be judged for its own sake and not for any outside political reasons . this is a great final shot of the white balloon in the air , that is not contrived or pretentious , but is genuinely a heartfelt and memorable moment of the film , topping off a very human film , that might surprise a lot of people that it was made in modern iran . the white balloon is a masterpiece in its simplicity , and the way its tale of the human condition is so easily related without demeaning the people involved ; and , how childhood is explored , pointing out how a child tries to grow up when faced with adversity , are unmatched in most hollywood films . if i had to compare it to any film that i have seen , i think of de sica's the bicycle thief and see some of the same values about life in both films . dennis schwartz : movie reviews ozus @sover . net "
1005,"a wonderful noir-type of film , that is actually more about style and ambiance than it is about what usually underlines the dark themes of the ticklish noir film subjects , that delve into the underbelly of their protagonist and evoke a certain sense of injustice in the world . all that is superfluous to bob the gambler ; in this film , he is more interested in taking care of his trenchcoat and fedora and giving hand-outs to those he likes , than he is in doing anything else but looking good . this is so much a movie about how the young and old can be screw-ups but are still okay with themselves , seemingly daring life to keep them from what they want to be . by the film's end we are convinced that we know a lot about bob , and come to the conclusion that he's a pretty good guy , thinking to ourselves , even though he is linked to gambling and crime , nevertheless , he does possess a wonderful character about him , something that is worthy of our praise . a great film , that is shot with perfection , capturing the nuances and finesse a master film-maker brings to his work , while shooting a low-budget b/w film , that tells a simple story , but is done with such effervescence , as to make us feel so much the better that we at least met this perfectly flawed character , even if it is only on film , since , for most of us , it is more than likely we will not have the chance to meet the likes of a true character like him in person . "
1006,"rivette has created a work of art from a short balzac story about art , "" the unfinished masterpiece . "" it is just something she does so she could be independent of nicolas . la belle noiseuse , which we are told , is the title of the masterpiece , is about a 17th century lady of the world who was kind of nutty in the sense that she was difficult to figure out , who is referred to as being someone who is a "" ball-buster . "" what makes for a captivating depiction of an artist at work , are scenes such as these , where one's sense of time is lost , and the length of the picture , ( it is 240 minutes ) does not seem wasted even for a minute , as we watch and become part of the creation , starting from scratch , and actually are hearing the artist's scratching sounds on the canvas for minutes at a time with no action on the screen but to view him work and watch him manipulate the model into the pose he wants , even when she complains that he is hurting her . frenhofer is stuck . he is filled with self-doubt if he can ever paint again . marianne asks him , "" why "" me "" naked in front of you , why not liz "" ? she goes on to say , "" i need to understand this "" . . . it seems the situation has reached a point of no return . every character is now playing out his emotional trump cards . there is a hint of a possible affair that might have taken place between balthazar and her ten- years ago , that seems to be the cause of the tension we feel among the three of them . liz says , "" for freno , it is the art of it , it is the capturing of a whole life in a painting--- it is that thing that makes art shameless , that is what matters to him . it is as if one can see one's whole life passing in a flash , like it might be for a person drowning . "" so the camaraderie between the two artists seems to be genuinely plausible , in the sense , that they do understand each other , that is , as far as their work goes . with freno , in the position of control in his life , he is able to patronizingly say to nicolas as he departs , "" i like you , don't ever change . "" the last shot is with the agent , talking numbers with frenhofer , deciding how much they will get for the masterpiece . the acting is exceptionally good by everyone . piccoli as the artist is mesmerizing , while emmanuelle is both beautiful and intelligent , offering a special quality about her that makes it possible for us to believe that a masterpiece could come out of her poses . the only thing that struck me as odd , is that the final masterpiece drawn , supposedly by bernard dufour , did not appear to me to be a masterpiece , but a rather ordinary work . the picture itself is the masterpiece ; that is , the creative process itself , was convincingly done , by a director who has the skills and knowledge to tell such a story and never allow the story to be wavering from its lofty position of significance , as anything but an honest intellectual effort , a search for the truth within . "
1007,"reportedly , satyajit ray said , of all the films he directed , that this was his favorite . at one point of the film , his face turns to glee as he is in his newspaper's press room and he exclaims that he just loves the smell of the ink press , there is nothing better in the world than that smell . there is a certain feeling to this b/w illustriously cinematographed film , that reflects the belief ray has , that life is a continual rhythm of birth and death , one is complete because of the other . what this is a film that is visually poetic , stunning in its apperceptive recognitions of life in the raw , without any wasted movement exerted , with expressive gestures counting for unsaid dialogue and untold physical encounters replaced by a nuance , such as , by a romantic notion , as charu has on a swing , just by a toss of her head upwards and she is seen in a swoon , and a deliberate word from her will slowly be turning into a potion that is magically brewing , as it is taking charge of all her pent-up emotions , as we imagine that we actually can see what is taking place inside the heads of the would-be lovers , even if nothing explicit materializes . "
1008,"he is of such a good nature , that he can't stand to argue with anyone or ask for something , even if it is rightfully his , putting all his fate in god . satyajit ray's old-fashioned and slow developing film , graced with the sublime sitar ragas of ravi shankar , is unpretentious and starkly beautiful in its depiction of the human condition just as it is , giving relevance to the lives of these ordinary people , without the need to be arty about it , as the characters find in their hearts how best to transcend the situation they are in . this film should be a magical lesson in film-making for those modern filmmakers who think they must inject heavy doses of symbolism to get their point across . "
1009,"he was just twenty-nine years- old and had made two brilliant feature films , zero conduct and this film . l'atalante is , perhaps , considered by some , a dated film as far as its style goes . but with that being said , there is no denying that it is still powerful viewing because of its magically developed poetical gestures to the subject of love and the refreshingly lyrical way it looks out at its surrounding seascape towns and at the human condition . the ordinary couple are playing out their vexing emotions without letting on how much these emotions mean to them , until it is almost too late . because their emotions and passions are so dominating , the quality of the film engulfs everyone aboard the barge in an unreal state . the seine looks so much like a dreamworld , where those on it are just drifting . because the story is such a simple one and the couple in so ordinary , it is not the story in itself that is exhilerating , as much as the way the film moves us to look at our own lives , with all its possibilities and disappointments . it makes us see things in a way that is disarmingly enchanting . that despite the moroseness and daily grind of regular life , there is also a poetical and romantic mood , waiting to be tapped . we makes his film an out-of-this world cinematic experience that sublimely lingers in our consciousness . the film version to see , which is now on video , is the restored 1990 one , that pierre philippe and jean-louis bompoint recovered missing footage for . the film is now more decipherable from the botched up initial showing of the film , that was not well received by the paris audience . it is good to see vigo's almost original version of the film resurrected , at last , and look so stunningly beautiful in black-and-white .

1010,"in any case , he has accomplished a work of exquisite visual craftsmanship , another fitting feather in the cap for one of the most original innovators in cinema today . his sharp photographic images intermingled with some grainy shots and his never static camera angles ( reminiscent of ones used in his other films ) and his use of different shades of light to transpose his visions from a dream world to reality , give the film a magical look , capturing and sweeping us into its grand design . it is a film that unfolds like a dream , whereby it is to be viewed with eyes wide shut . the film's opening immediately engages us in its sexuality : the tall , curvaceous lady peeling off her black dress with her back to us , is nicole kidman , and the next shot fades to darkness , it is as if the curtain was pulled down on a sex show and we are told that now that we have seen her lovely ass , the rest is up to our imagination . the show is over ; we can make of it what we want . the intricate telling of their relationship involves the dreams they have , a ceremonial orgy he attends , nudity-including his viewing and kissing of a corpse for a long few moments , a jealous marital relationship to tweak our morbid curiosity , and an obtuse ending that should satisfy those who can't accept tidy endings in their films . make no mistake about it , sex is their problem . kubrick , bless his courage , will stick to this obsessive theme , not giving an inch of leeway for any other reason , from the alpha to the omega of the film . and to his credit , it is that intensity that gives the story fuel to propel itself and work its way into the understanding we have of the chemistry and dynamics in the relationship the two have . a picture perfect relationship that is shown to be already not perfect after the first five minutes of the film . that cruise is nearly perfect for the part ( the only slight negative thing about his performance was that his constant cell phone action reminded me too much of the jerry maguire character ) , as he displays a wide range of emotions and ability , to be a turd and then come back and be human again , is the kind of acting he hasn't been required to do so far in his career , but with the wonderful relationship he developed with stanley , he is able to understand who he is and be able to be convincing as a young doctor for the rich and as a dye-in-the-wool materialist , committed to being a doctor and intelligent enough to see changes in his life as necessities . the entire cast is superb . the this scene is sheer brilliance , one of the best kubrick has ever done , it is a scene that is so humanly emotional , something that his naysayers said he could never do ; the acting catches all the nuances of a real and fictious relationship , something that an inexperienced acting duo could not have done so effortlessly and made it seem so impactful . what made the streets particularly foreboding was the skillful manipulation of lights to reflect either a dream or reality world he was in , with the penetrating brightness of the neon emanating from the clubs and storefronts making them look like sites from hell . the slide down a decadent path for the couple ends mirthfully , but on a seemingly depersonalized note , as alice's answer to everything is a resounding let's f * * * . this film has all the earmarks of a masterpiece despite its let down in certain spots : is the cruise character worth all the fuss over saving ? is kubrick's overtly homosexual characterization of a desk clerk gratuitous or necessary to show that cruise attracts both men and women to him ? it is probably a film that has to be seen a few times before its characterizations fully sink in and the power of its story can be fully appreciated . the whole societal process of how dehumanized we have all become is opened up for further speculation , as sex our most intimate response to love is dehumanized and played out in the need for an orgy . this two day whirlwind the couple has might be the beginning of who knows what , and that is scary , as most people want some reassurances about their future . a thinking man's work of art has evolved , and a very splendid film to end the century on , as well as to end the career of one of our most distinguished directors . in this film's case , all the hype the film got did not work against it . "
1011,"the country itself was a bit paranoid during this tense period of the cold war . as technology used in the wrong way was no laughing matter , a nuclear war was a strong possibility . that this film is able to exploit that craziness of attitudes prevailing and make a stinging satirical comedy out of it , a film that is not pass ? , even as of today , in 1999 , after 35 years , speaks volumes for its satirical power . the nature of the film is irreverence for those who are involved in building up this nuclear conflict . a theme of inhumanity kubrick kept intact throughout his film career , even in his last film , eyes wide shut . . . this is one of the greatest political satires , if not the greatest ever made . a not to be missed film . "
1012,"simply put , this is one of the best crime films ever made . especially considering that it was made on a budget of only $230 , 000 . it most closely resembles in style and scope the work of the great french directors jean-pierre melville and jacques becker , as a classic noir tale depicting man's foibles of greed and betrayal . the the robbery itself is told in multiple flashback style , as each character gets a chance to tell his version of the story , which is done in parts , so that each character's story is not only told but the film is able to jump back and forth in time , allowing for several events to happen together . she also clearly had the two best lines in the film : if people didn't have headaches , what would happen to the aspiren industry ? what makes this film so tense and gripping , is the exacting details that went into making this caper work , as it is seen through the eyes of the odd mixture of characters who commit the robbery . the point made , is a theme that kubrick will return to many times in his long career in films , that their perfect robbery fails because of the human condition they couldn't control and not because the robbery wasn't perfectly executed . it fits in with kubrick's notion of life : that it is vital for one to see how the pieces are played out on the chess board and how the player who does not always have the best strategy or execution can still win by learning how to persevere and change as the game does . as one of kubrick's early features , it remains one of his greatest films , even without the added visual dimensions he was to pour into his later high-budget , more complex movies . the outstanding cast made everything look natural , and the gritty realism of the story was only enhanced by the glorious b/w cinematography . "
1013,"john ford's epic western about america and its racial past , is the quintessential american film about what it once meant to be american , more than any other film that i could think of , and that includes citizen kane . it is ford's best , one that is much more than the western it appears to be ; it is a film that is eventually about self-discovery , seen symbolically through the eyes of one man , john wayne . there is not one single actor in the world who could have played this part better than wayne . in the opening scene , he is only there briefly and does not feel very comfortable in that short stay , even when idolized by the children . ethan does not belong to either the white settlers or the indians . that he hates indians so much , yet speaks their language and feels comfortable with their ways , more so than he does with white society , makes it difficult to figure why he has so much hatred for them . his story is visceral poetry , a tragedy that turns ridiculous , as ford wanted it to be , and it has unexpected psychological twists to it that can be read into the story by one's own relationship with america . it is hard not to substitute his hatred for indians into a hatred for blacks , and it is easy to see how wayne's soul could be construed as america's soul . make no mistake about it , this is not an ordinary or very good western , this is undoubtedly a masterpiece of american cinema , one that many of the early 1950s film critics couldn't see . it is not that it is a particularly profound movie , but it is one that caught the emotions and the metaphors of a rich country with a paradoxical past and an intangible future . over-the-years , the status of this film has grown immeasurably , to the point that its anti-hero hero is now a fixture on the cinematic scene , along with the recognition that ford has created a work that searches deeply into a man's interior and into the country's consciousness . if there was a more perceptive western made , one that captured the visions of america better , i have not seen such a film . if there is such a film out there , i will take the liberty of using wayne's favorite retort in the film : "" that'll be the day . "" "
1014,"2001 : a space odyssey is a meditative quest , an inspirational sci-fi film that defies its genre in scope and attitude , it is a film of tremendous visual impact and innovation . this was done before star wars and at time when sci-fi films were were mostly low-budget productions . it is kubrick's masterpiece . a film that encourages our contemplation of every scene , as each was carefully and intelligently shot with that in mind , as it is only through our own effort can we come away with an understanding of the film . hal is even programed with human emotions , but we are not certain if these emotions are genuine . this has been interpreted by many , that kubrick has made a pessimistic film about the inevitable conflict with man and his machines , but it just might be that what he is saying , is we better not rely completely on machines , no matter how infallible they may appear to be . the first half-hour of the film is filled with splendid silence , showing the apes doing their destructive thing , and it takes about an hour into the film before the plot starts to develop , as the infamous bone is thrown into the air by the ape and the scene slowly dissolves into one showing a space shuttle , as we zoom into a space terminal and hear our first words in the film . it is as if the baton is passed to the higher order of beings , saying we got you so far , can you take us all the way home , across the finish line of evolution . the tedious pace of the film has a hypnotic affect , contrasting the primitive beastiality of our ancestors with the polite deceptions of our future relatives . the johann strauss waltz "" blue danube , '' which accompanies the docking of the space shuttle and the space station , is deliberately slow , and thereby offers no resistance to the non-action taking place on screen . while richard strauss' "" thus spake zarathustra "" , provided energy and vitality to the space flight and became the film's very popular signature theme . all this presents a rather rosy picture of what high tech can do for us ; that is , if we play our cards right and don't do something stupid , like blow up the world . what kubrick pays most attention to , is the spacecraft's design and the terminal's details , as they are shown as if they were placed under a microscope and examined by us to see if we can pick up any faults in them . as they heed what dr . floyd warns , "" this mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it , by telling you before hand what it is about . '' that science is held up as the finder of our truths , was never more ably said . kubrick seems to be delivering a sound message to politicians , scientists and theologians , alike . the aliens who created this environment are not shown , as the film ends very mysteriously , which has been a source of lots of commentary , and has inspired meanings-- from it's all rubbish-- to-- something divine has happened . this film , ultimately , is about the need mankind has to transcend his limited thinking and move into dimensions that are greater than his narrow aims . it is not a pessimistic film , as some have suggested , neither is it an optimistic film ; it is a film based on self-discovery and intellect and contemplation . it is one of the great original works of cinema , maybe even the best ; it is a film that is not even a bit dated as i view it once again in 1999 , still awed by the spectacle and mystery of it . "
1015,"even with a minimal amount of conversations taking place , the characters were seen dancing and horsing around , as their personalities were allowed to shine forth in a natural manner . in reality , this never occurred in vietnam ; but , it is used by cimino as a necessary metaphor to show how insane the war is . this one-shot theory when it is used for deer hunting , can be seen as something sensible , as if it reflects true sportsmanship . this film offers a very puzzling and complex moral take on the war and on those who were directly affected by it , as cimino makes no apology for the volunteer soldiers fighting a bad war , he only revels in how poignant michael's odyssey is-for he is the hero of this story and the most compelling one in it-but even he can't feel at home after his adventure , his war experiences were too mind-boggling for him to even talk about what is bothering him . what makes this film exceptional , one of the best films of the '70s , is not the story , which is good but not great , and not the cinematography , which is pleasing in scope but doesn't break new ground in its camera work . it is the performers themselves who take the story to spell-binding heights and make this a great film , making you care enormously about the characters they play . de niro gives a riveting performance as he searches for meaning to his life , making his patriotism seem genuine and his participation in a war that made no sense to a lot of people , something that needs no apology , just like his deer kill is done like a true sportsman would do it ; that is , if you must kill a deer , at least , do it the right way . streep's performance is more subtle , as her facial expressions give way to the great psychological strain she is under , not sure of what is happening to her , but realizing that there is a tremendous void in her life . john savage is convincing as a good guy who got a few bad breaks in life and couldn't fully recover from it . walken won an oscar as a supporting actor , in a film that won a total of five oscars , including those for best picture , editing , sound , and director . the remainder of the cast added to the haunting feeling that this was a tale of significant moral and political weight . cazale's performance as a weasel , staying out of the war , hiding behind a phony macho persona , is a fitting one , in contrast to the guys who enlisted . it is an astonishing film . a one of a kind experience . the stupidity of the war and all its atrocities , as it is stunningly presented by the filmmaker , leaves one without a chance to escape the moral implications of the war or does it give one a chance to recapture a lost innocence . the filmmaker seems to be saying , you can run away from vietnam and try to avoid it , but you can't get completely away from it , its devastation touched every part of america , and this film , whose viewpoint is not taken from the liberal side of the political spectrum , as anti-war films usually are , but wants to respect the opinions of conservative working -class america , the one's who sent their sons to fight this war . and what the film offers as a poignant reminder about war , even as it is a testament to the soldiers of the war , is how the war harmed even those who coolly survived it , and how it left the american psyche scarred for life . "
1016,"carl theodor dreyer's emotionally intense masterpiece , the passion of joan of arc , soundly evokes the passion and resonance of france's heroine , the soul of her country , who was burned at the stake in 1431 for being a heretic and then in 1920 was made a saint , as if time can heal such wounds . not relying on the standard techniques used in silent films during that time frame , nor on the avant-garde and surrealist's vision of the radical 1920s on debunking the church , the danish filmmaker , dreyer , concentrated on making an intensely personal film , a film that eluded any known styles . the passion of joan of arc featured many close-ups of joan ( ren ? e maria falconetti ) and the judges , and used the symbols of the church to show the extent of its authority . though the film appeared to be shot without any long and medium shots , that was not the case . it just seemed that way because dreyer , for reasons of getting at the truth without any other interference , had made isolated shots of joan , showing how alone she was from her accusers , and from the soldiers and peasants watching the trial , and these shots became abstractions , allowing you to think of them as being solely close-ups . it is because of this style that we are forced to concentrate only on the main players and on the truth of the trial , and our attention is not diverted in any other direction . the genius of dreyer in assembling a cast that was perfectly suited for their parts is a major reason for this work of art and critically acclaimed icon in the history of filmmaking to be as absorbing as it was . he picked her because under her skin-deep beauty and makeup he saw her soul and the simplicity of her nature . no actor wore makeup , every attempt was made to make things seem as natural as possible . dreyer was rewarded with his choice for actress , by getting from her one of the greatest magical performances ever seen in the history of films . falconetti , interestingly enough , never made another film , but instead chose to go back to doing light comedies on the stage , except for a brief respite , where she repeated her joan role on the french stage . the rest of his casting was also inspired , this time by a mixture of professional actors and those chosen in the bistros , as he opted to cast for his english general , warwick , someone who in real-life was a cafe-keeper . the film's opening is a study in starkness . the contrasts between the two shots will be a recurring theme of the film : historical events will seem to be eternal . joan : "" i know nothing about that . joan : when i have done what god sent me to do i shall resume wearing a woman's dress . "" the filmmaking of the trial was so austere ; it was easy to believe that this was the actual trial taking place . the scene was so intense , that when it was being shot , all the stagehands brought her flowers on that occasion , and dreyer made the gesture of taking her tears gently into his hands in a moving tribute to her performance and how powerful it was . the film's spiritual sense of being is layed in the moral rectitude of joan and her willingness not to forego suffering . what captures one's imagination about dreyer's version of joan- and this film is almost completely his version- as he all but ignored joseph delteil's slight novel on which the film was based on- is that dreyer recognized that joan ultimately took a stand for all those who are opposed to social authority and who are determined to be true to their own nature and are prepared to offer whatever self- sacrifice is required . in contrast , is the honest gaze exhibited from the close-up of joan , who seems to be so much the better of a person than those pack of phonies she is forced to look at and be condemned by , that we are forced to see how the faces of evil are contrasted with the face of a good person , and dreyer's abstractions , of sticking to the shot he takes until you see what you have to see , until it grows on you , leaving you with a feeling of real sorrow as she is finally burned at the stake , in a trial that seemed in the film as if it took a day or two , but went on for about five months , in actuality . this is one of the most memorable films ever made , one that is hard to forget , as it ends on the bleakest of notes , with joan burned at the stake in front of a group of grieving spectators . "
1017,"jim jarmusch ( stranger than paradise/permanent vacation/ down by law/ mystery train/night on earth ) has directed and written a poetically unique and disturbing western , one that is an american masterpiece , and is clearly one of the best films of the '90s . the electrical guitar played and scored by neil young , complements the eerie mood of the film , as young's improvised melodic theme is repeated with different strains and variations to it throughout . the film could also be viewed as if one were reading a book of poems , as each scene is separated by a blackout , which allows the next scene to be read as a new poem or viewed as a new development in the film , one that is not necessarily related to the previous scene . this film is viewed on the side of the outsider , the loner , and the visionary , who have the wherewithal to see through all the violence that america is built around in its pursuit of happiness and economic comfort . aside from jarmusch's deadpan humor , the dreamlike intonations , the psychedelics , and the surreal camerawork ( a beautifully shot black-and-white film by robby m ? ller slowly unfolding , that catches hold of the deathlike odyssey sequences and the superb imagery of the landscape ) , but also relates a strong history lesson and a colorful mystical tour of the death experience that adds an especially vibrant visionary sense to this stunning and problematical film . blake's destination point , is a squalid place , with no redeeming features or common civility about it . this is an original film , the kind that you are not likely to see being made from those box office watching directors and those studio heads who wouldn't know a real visionary work even if the real william blake was to appear before them and shout his poems into their ears . what makes this film particularly exciting , that allows it to have such a real-blakeian feel about it , is when some of those magnificent blake-like aphorisms are dropped into the film , such as when nobody says , "" the eagle never lost so much time as when he submitted to learn of the crow . "" this fits easily into the flow and grace of this perfectly made film , where nobody can say "" you don't stop the clouds by building a ship , "" and that could either be taken for an old indian saying , or something nobody made up , or one of blake's sayings from his "" songs of innocence "" and "" songs of experience . "" the most remarkable aspect about this film , is not only that it didn't falsely romanticize the western settler and idolize him for how good he was with a gun , as most films foolishly do , but it debunked that whole western john ford type of liberal myth , that the cowboy was doing all that violence to advance civilization , that if the indian can be civilized he can and should live with the white man . that sort of feeling those films conveyed , coming only from the white man's patronizing position of superiority , left a lot to be desired , even if ford in his masterpiece "" the searchers "" did tune in to the inherent racism in america , he still couldn't convey with the kind of depth this film does , how the indian viewed the white man . in this pyschedelic western film , blake and nobody are almost complete opposites , contraries if you will , borrowing from one of the bard's adages of how best to gain wisdom . humor is sometimes a saving grace when all else fails and that is what is indisputably working here , in the odd relationship between the two travelers ; and , even if what jarmusch's well-researched , historically accurate film was delving at , is not always clear to some of the viewers , as the establishment critics who dutifully lambasted this film because they said they didn't get it , even though , they say that they laud the poetry of blake , but still hated the film for its murkiness ( i feel these are the same sorts that called blake a madman in his lifetime and said his work was rubbish , and i am not surprised in the least at their negativity toward this original film ) . the film had energy ; and energy , blake said , is 'eternal delight . ' it also has a prophetic message for the modern technological age , and that message is that all is not rosy if we continue to destroy the planet and ourselves . it's not that cool a thing to just shoot people , as portrayed in so many popular action films , films that think they have to substitute action for image . "
1018,"stanley kubrick's first big financed a film and first film with a major hollywood star . kirk douglas who liked the script , thinking it would give him a chance to work on a quality film with a strong social message , thereby getting his production company to back it . this antiwar film , one of the best ever made , much like renoir's masterpiece "" the grand illusion , "" does a great job of criticizing the role of the french military higher-ups in ww1 . the movie turns most of its attention to the action taking place in a military courtroom court-martial and the interplay between the officer's political manuevering for power . kubrick's masterpiece was more cynical and gritty than renoir's very poetic and humane indictment of war . one reason why this was so , was because it hit harder at those who were its subjects and as a result many country's reacted so vehemently as to officially oppose the film . it should also be pointed out , that the ambitious kubrick rewrote the original script to give the film a more traditional hollywood upbeat ending to it , much to kirk douglas's surprise and disapproval . kubrick , reportedly , wanted the film to be a box office success and was willing to forgo artistic integrity . the controversial ending might be termed a cop-out by many , while others found its sentimentalities quite appropriate and cynical enough . incidentally , in my opinion , the major flaw in paths of glory wasn't the taut script , which was lucid and hard-hitting , but it was in kirk douglas's egomaniacal performance ( though a strong performance and the best one in kirk's career ) . but , as forceful and necessary as kirk's performance was , it still allowed the film to become centered around him , rather than on the universality of the story unfolding in its very natural and engrossing way about the horrors , evils , and insanity of war . kubrick aimed for a critique both of war and of class systems . he accomplished this by pessimistically and cynically showing how the privilege class cares only about themselves and how its power is corrupting . we are told that world war i has dragged on for two years and that it became a stalemate of fortified trenches and heavy casualties . war but then broulard says that a promotion awaits , there will be consideration for another star . after dax says it is not possible to do , mireau says , "" show me a patriot and i'll show you an honest man . "" but mireau , not to be undone in the generosity of the moment , says let's make it 3 and have the 701st's three commanding officers choose one from each outfit . broulard says we better get a court-martial for them and make it legal . angrily , dax turns him down , as broulard looks at him incredulously , as if he were a fool , saying you really cared about saving those three men , you are an idealist . dax tells him to give the men a few minutes . the film is direct and powerful . it wouldn't have been banned for so long if it didn't hit home with its hard message . it is magnificently shot , as the trenches are frighteningly real and incomprehensible to understand until seen . kirk douglas is overwhelming in his stabilizing role , in my opinion too much so . but , nevertheless , his anger is warranted , as he is the emotional glue that holds the film together and gives humanity some measure for hope . though i came away from the film feeling no hope . i was cynical of everyone's motives , including dax's . to call him a hero , as the ending of the film implies by its crass sentimentality , as it shows him going back to the front , left me cold . adolphe menjou and george macready came through with outstanding performances , each one an incarnation of machiavellian evil . when on screen , their performances are like machine gun fire directed at you . there is much to chew on idea-wise , despite how simple the film might appear on first viewing it , and thereby lies its true greatness , as it seems to make a timeless argument against war ; and , as in most kubrick films , it is not dated , in fact , it seems to get better with age . "
1019,"a splendidly chilling noir tale about murder , immorality , lust , and greed . the three stars are all magnificent . the director , billy wilder , an austrian ? migr ? , is in top form , as this film was made before he became too leery of hollywood and became more cynical than hard-boiled . it was wilder himself who made the script so taut , relying on the drunken chandler for limited support , as he was too inebriated to work on the script but very skilled in making the dialogue sparkle . the result of wilder's efforts to streamline the story and keep it obsessive , is a film that can make you sweat . its dark and moody cinematography is brilliantly shot by john seitz , setting up the hypnotic rhythmical flow of the story , as narrated by macmurray's noir-like voiceover . if all that wasn't enough to make this one of the best noir films ever , add on the odd attraction the two killers have for each other and the genuine relationship between the macmurray and robinson characters , which is almost father and son like , plus you got a film that perfectly captures the dark atmosphere of the prewar los angeles scene . i didn't get the money . and i didn't get the woman . '' while she seems to be without a heart , a cold and bitter femme fatale , who , at first look , seems to be at blame for what transpired . but , on another look , it seems as if chance played a great part in the tragedy that was to happen , as the two combustible personalities were alike more than what they at first realized , and their chance encounter set everything in motion . they will carry off a murder that they probably wouldn't have done if they just thought about what they were doing and what they really wanted . there is a genuine love between them , but they are both too caught up in portraying the hardened men they want to appear as , than to recognize their very tender needs . it would have been a perfect crime , but then too many questions kept popping up . this interest in lola is refreshing for him , he finds that he would rather be with her than with phyllis . i'm rotten to the heart . i used you , just as you said . that's all you ever meant to me . until a minute ago , when i couldn't fire that second shot . "" neff a running gag throughout the film , is that neff continually lights the cigars of the "" matchless "" keyes . as wilder's perverse sense of humor , supports the film's grim conclusion , that both phyllis and neff were not criminals in the real sense of being criminals , but were weak-minded individuals , unhappy with their lives , who succumbed to their human failings . wilder's original ending of having neff die in the gas chamber was scrubbed by him as being unnecessary , so we'll never know if that ending was more powerful than the present one . wilder told an interviewer that neff's death was among "" two of the best scenes i've ever shot in my whole life "" ( the other being the sunset boulevard opening ) . what this ending left was a question mark , as i wondered why neff returns to the office to confess to keyes , if what he really wanted to do was to escape . take note of their last comments : "" you know why you couldn't figure this one , keyes ? i'll tell you . because the guy you were looking for was too close--right across the desk from you . '' keyes says , "" closer than that , walter , '' and then neff says , ``i love you , too . '' "
1020,"in this film , about a child-murderer , his first talkie , it was made with surprisingly the highest sound quality , which is quite an achievement if you keep in mind how this was his first experience with that new medium . new york , 1947 , lang stated why he has such an avid interest in murder : "" gradually , and at times reluctantly , i have come to the conclusion that every human mind harbors a latent compulsion to murder . "" you can chalk "" m "" up as a lasting masterpiece , created with a passion for detail and a successful transitional film from the silents to the talkies , taking into its mise en scene the best of both those worlds . at its best , "" m "" emulates the accomplishments found in all the great works of poetry . it is still the greatest of all the serial killer films made , even if it is mistakeningly considered by some , now , as merely a museum piece . all you have to do is compare the depth of its storytelling with the greatest films of that genre , a genre that lang's film spawned , such as psycho and the silence of the lambs . and , when you compare it to a slick thriller , like the recent american psycho , it is not difficult to see how shallow that one is in comparison . this tune will become the ominous leitmotif throughout the film . since lorre couldn't whistle , it was lang's whistling that was used . it is evident that lang saw here the festering wounds nazism would later on fully exploit to its own advantages , in a society that was already decadent and had lost its sense of responsibility . what gives this film its power , is how the entire city is analyzed by how they react to the crime . the film is expeditious in its stark treatment of the innocuous lorre , who does not stand out from the crowd and is physically a small and fragile man . he finally screams out , getting the pity of a few , "" i have no control over my urges . i want to escape from myself , but it is impossible . "" "
1021,"writer/director john sayles weaves an intriguing story that is both a mystery and a study about the relationship between the generations and the races . this is a slow moving , superbly acted , thoughtful , provocative look at america's past and where it is now , as seen through the past lives of the main characters depicted in the three ethnic communities . the laconic tone of the film and the strong intellect in the script bring so many other things to the table , that the mystery , even though it is followed through and wrapped up , is not quite as important as all the other issues it brings up . the subtle message being that the past must be remembered but it is more important that the future must not be blurred by what already happened and can't be changed . this ambitious project is an engrossing and an original work . there are no predictable and formulaic messages , this is one of the great films of the 1990s , one that is done with wit and tact . everything about it rings with truth , even if it has to break down a few legends to get its point across -- proving that often enough , legends are not all they are cracked up to be .

1022,"this neglected low-budget b/w noir film from the 1950s is a beaut , an absolutely superb thriller . it reminds me so much of jean-pierre melville's great existentialist character studies he presented in his noir films , such as in le samurai ( 67 ) , where the point of the film remains less on the story and more on how the protagonist is suave and calculatingly dispassionate . claude is ready to give up , saying the woman is a jinx , you can't go against a jinx or you end up dead . this is a perfectly nuanced film , with the atmospheric noir cinematography by lucien ballard , plus a brilliantly appropriate one-man guitar musical arrangement heard in the background . the film also had a beautiful feel for who the character is and the situation he was in , as there were no phony contrivances , as everything about this film felt natural . they don't make noir films better than this . interestingly enough , the director and screenwriter never went on to something even close to the quality this b film achieved , while this role deservedly catapulted vince edwards career into stardom .

1023,"since the film didn't have a director , the film's star , charlton heston , suggested to the people at universal that they get orson to direct it ( this is heston's version ) . it was magnificently photographed by emphasizing the contrasts between dark and light shades as filmed by the great cinematographer russell metty , which abetted the imaginative tale , whose main story is about the downfall of the sleazy , obese lawman played with sheer brilliance by orson . it's a b-film more powerful and hard-boiled than the weak-minded upper-studio heads at universal could handle . the video that came out in the '70s was an interpretation of the three re-edited versions , which was far removed from the way orson wanted it seen . the film ended up as a box office disappointment , giving ammo to those in hollywood who said that he could only make an art film and not a commercial one . orson refused to recognize the version that universal sent to the movie theaters as his film , in fact he called it an 'odious thing . ' never fully receiving the recognition that the film should have gotten for the masterpiece it was , it was even considered by some film critics to be a disappointing welles film , not comparable to his masterpiece of "" citizen kane . "" the film , nevertheless , got recognized abroad , especially by the french new wave directors and eventually the film was starting to get a following among young intellectuals in this country and started to get its just recognition for the poetically visionary and original film it was . it was a film that did things films never did before , both technically and as a hard-hitting baroque thriller . it was the first film to have natural dialogue in a moving car . it is arguably the greatest opening shot in film history because of its visual impact in setting up the feature's characters and the tenseness of the story that was to follow . orson used a hand-held camera and specialized not only in wide-angle shots but by his constant intercutting , he was able to keep the action flowing and the story suspenseful . the film had been restored somewhat by 1978 for its video distribution and it picked up some running time from how it was first shown at 96 minutes and now it was back to its original time of 108 minutes . in the 1990s the film was finally pieced together from the memo orson sent the studio and the hack director's scenes were cut , and it picked up an additional three minutes . the effort to restore the film to the way orson originally shot it , allowed the story to become clearer and for the film to have the shape the artist wanted it to have . this is about the closest we could get to the way orson filmed it , since he passed away in 1985 and we have no other idea about what else he may have wanted to do with the film . spoiler : for those who don't want to follow the rest of the story , please stop reading at this point and resume reading the last paragraph , which makes some further points about the film . the subtle beauty of this scene , is in the restored version , where it looks as if the machine killed him . fans of the cinema should be pleased with this restored work and after seeing it will have a chance to judge for themselves which version is the masterpiece . there should be no doubt about what that choice should be . for cinefiles , thanks must go out to those who put in such a worthwhile effort to get this restoration accomplished .

1024,"claire denis ( i can't sleep/nenette and boni/no fear , no die ) has created a cinematic work of great poetry and reverie : a masterpiece . there are many films that influenced denis , but the works of alain renais , especially his muriel , probably influenced her the most . it's a film so visually stunning and so magnificently palpable in its cinematography and in its lively camera movements and fascinating narrative speculations , and most of all , in its lyrical sensuality , that it runs poetically adrift with its listless hypnotic pace , its sparse dialogue forcing the viewer to see what is not being said , and by its strange brooding mood it sets , as it tells in a matter of fact tone a story of hate , alienation and envy through the eyes of the narrow-minded french foreign legionnaire who found freedom in his remorse . its background shots are just as important as its story line and its theme , as it helps explore the everyday boredom the men face , of the trite routines the macho men are under , and the underlying violence it evokes in them . the minimally told story is made all the more powerful by many vivid shots , such as the one of the emerald water contrasted with the barren desert , or of the distant mountains which seem to have a language of their own that speaks to us of things we cannot know , or of the unobtrusive native women in their colorful dresses that we see in the marketplace or at the disco , who strike a chord in us with their musical gestures and mocking tones . the local women are just as much a part of the story as anything else in the film is , even though they are not directly part of the plot . there are also the close-ups of the interracial legionnaires living as brothers who have to reinforce this by ritualistically hugging and separating from each other in what seems to be weirdly homoerotic embraces , but can also be viewed as a parody of such romantic notions . beau travail literally means beautiful work , and this film delivers all that and more . it seems like it has been ages since i have been so enthused about a film as i am by this one . i have a lot of time ahead of me . ' galoup is not afraid to openly state how he was driven by the twisted state of his mind to behave in such a maddening way against such a selfless and blank individual , someone he found hard to believe really exists . time seems irrelevant for the soldiers , memories seem to come and go , as they do their military drills looking at times like teutonic mythical gods while half-naked ( these scenes provoke , mock and remind us of the leni riefenstahl kitsch art and homoerotic heroes she gave us in both triumph of the will and olympiad--though denis's characterizations seemed all the more potent , purposeful and vital ) . to iron a perfect crease in their uniform is part of their reason for being in the legion , because it makes them look special . beau travail is the memories of such idol pleasures and such a need to fit in somewhere , even if it is into something that appears as useless as the legion , which doesn't seem to have any purpose anymore without the days of french colonization and the algerian war . the legion is their love fantasy , it is something that can't be understood by anyone but true lovers . this is her breakthrough genius film , a film that stands heads and shoulders over the talented director's other films . what adds to the film , is the robust musical score of benjamin britten's billy budd oratorio and the choreography staged by one of the actors who played a legionnaire , bernardo montet . all the military exercises were like watching a ballet , as the entire film had the fresh look of something so beautiful , that it has to be seen .

1025,"the young kid doesn't know what to say . yang-yang is not only the namesake of the director , but speaks for him in this film . so how can i know what you see ? "" at one point of the film the director through the character who reacts the most emotional , the very thin "" fatty , "" tells his movie date that movies are not a waste of time , but enrich one's life . they even increase your life three times because the movies tell us about things we could never possibly know . he gives one example of murder , but that didn't go over too well with ting-ting . this one is a masterpiece , despite it being as inexplicable as a great work of music sometimes is . it lays out the grief facing a problematic family and we see it happening , but we never quite understand why ; and , we will have to accept as an answer that is because individuals are very complex and if they can't tell us what is on their mind , we can only guess what they are thinking . and , isn't that the way you find it with many people ? maybe finding happiness isn't so simple a matter . maybe we are destined to follow a certain course and even if given a second chance would still make the same mistakes . the director knows that we are all unique and have our own way of seeing things , and he respects that . but whatever , there was a certain raw , undefinable power that this great filmmaker has that makes this story fulfilling ; even if , we are never quite sure if we are fulfilled by what we saw . but one thing is certain , you can't put this iconoclastic filmmaker in a box and label him . i wouldn't miss this one . as entertaining a film as crouching tiger . . . was , it didn't have this film's depth and poignancy . "
1026,"the film's theme is about how women are made to suffer in iran because of its harsh islamic laws against them , which makes all of their lives placed in the same never ending circle of repression . which is why the film has no main protagonist ; the cast , except for fereshteh sadr orafai and fatemeh naghavi , are all nonprofessionals . jafar panahi ( white balloon/the mirror ) , a disciple of abbas kiarostami , has created a devastatingly restrained powerhouse of a political film . a winner of the golden lion at the venice film festival , even though it has been banned in iran except for a one-time screening to a small student audience . a woman's life is shown to be not as worthy as a man's in modern iran , as the story of one woman is carried on as the story of another woman's . the enemy obviously isn't the iranian people , but an intolerant government that cannot bend and forces its stupid rules down a subjected peoples' throats . this film conveys these dark feelings through a story without much of a plot or dialogue , yet brilliantly establishes the yearnings for freedom that these women have . it's much like those warner brother films of the 1930s with jimmy cagney thumbing his nose at the high brows . panafi has taken us into the psyche of the oppressive regime and without saying what's right or wrong , allows us instead to see for ourselves the everyday street life of modern iran . it's a country far from freedom , yet its filmmakers can still make a film that is unpredictable and forthright . this is something that's rarely accomplished in uncensored hollywood whose commercial ventures are mostly formulaic crowd pleaser films . these are amazing restrictions placed on them and ones that panafi allows us to see in an exciting and unforgettable way . it's a moody , realistic tale about iran that the news media can't seem to cover with a reasonable verisimilitude as well as this very daring effort does . it succeeds in showing us as much as one can in today's iran about its long laundry list of injustices . this is one film that cannot easily be forgotten , even as we lose sight of the different women we have seen . all the performances were natural and easily fit into the story . the facial expressions of both orfani and mamizade caught my attention : orfani's had that caring , intense look of the italian actress anna magnani ; while mamizade's expression changed from curiosity to vulnerability .

1027,"i'm guessing -- and from the available evidence , it's not a great guess -- that burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire of hollywood excess , stupidity , ego and power-mongering . if so , the film that ended up on the screen ranks as one of the most spectacularly ironic unintentional jokes in film history . that left a film satire in the hands of writer joe eszterhas , as humorless a hack as ever put finger to word processor . and you could just smell the disaster brewing . if you're unfortunate enough to sit through burn hollywood burn , you'll still be smelling that disaster long after the lights come up . it's bad enough that burn hollywood burn has -- literally -- not a single laugh for its entire , blissfully brief 84 minutes . what makes it even worse is eszterhas' insistence upon telling every bad joke not once , but twice or even three times . michael ovitz references , showgirls references , oral sex references , whoopi goldberg/ted danson references -- all show up multiple times with all the subtlety that is eszterhas' stock-in-trade . the reduncancy even manages to turn actively offensive with some frequency , notably with the hilarious use of the word "" feminist "" as an identifying caption for every single female character in the film . those documentary captions , for all their leaden obviousness , allow the best insight into what's so hideously wrong with burn hollywood burn . not content to stick any hollywood type with only one jab from his rapier wit , eszterhas fills the screen with bullet points every time a new character appears . this is a petulant schoolboy's idea of satire -- pictures of hollywood insiders to which eszterhas has taken a pen to draw little moustaches and black out the teeth . the last stomach-churning straw comes when burn hollywood burn closes with out-takes over the closing credits , the kind that show the audience how much fun everyone was having making the film that just sucked an hour and a half of your life away . pity everyone involved with this excessive , ego-driven "" satire "" of excess and ego . it's too bad that only directors can remove their names from noxious material like this . otherwise , you might have seen credits for burn hollywood burn overflowing with alan smithees . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1028,"there's bad buzz , and then there's the the bad buzz which surrounded the avengers , the kind that sounds like a swarm of africanized bees after a particularly vigorous hive-shaking . a gratuitous "" f-word "" had even been added to bump the rating from a pg to pg-13 . then , all the worst fears seemed to be confirmed when warner bros . announced that no advance screenings would be held for the media . you may think you're ready for the possibility that a film could be bad , but little can prepare you for something as pointless , smug and misguided as the avengers . it is the latter which proves most instantly and consistently grating in the avengers . ralph fiennes and uma thurman spend most of their scenes together engaging in a smirk throwing contest , each one trying to look the most amused with him or herself , eyebrows so prominently arched you're afraid someone might sprain something . this despite the fact that don macpherson's dialogue is a study in witlessness , tossing out embarrassing puns as though they were saucy enough to turn oscar wilde green with envy . though they generally appear content to let their wardrobe do most of the acting for them , fiennes and thurman should be commended for one impressive demonstration of dramatic skill : they're able to treat the most mundane comments as though they were nuggets of pure comic gold bestowed upon the world . that kind of quip-heavy self-awareness was certainly true of the namesake television series as well , so what's so wrong with this variation on the theme ? in short , both the personnel and the context . patrick macnee and diana rigg , the most celebrated of the series' pairings , shared a genuine chemistry which made the romantic tension fun to watch . fiennes and thurman appear far too enamored of their own charm and cleverness to bother connecting with one another . they're also dropped into a summer blockbuster milieu entirely inappropriate for light-hearted capering . imagine an episode of the old "" batman "" series with a $70 million budget , and you'll understand what's so wrong with the avengers . it's hard to endear yourself to an audience with low-tech campiness at the same time you're blowing something up every 10 minutes , or sending huge mechanical insects after our heroes like something out of the speeder bike chase from return of the jedi . we're long past the point of pretending that plot or character has anything to do with 1990s-model hollywood summer fare , so i won't even bother slapping the avengers around for exhibiting symptoms of that particular contagious disease . but such a film has to give you something to latch on to : engaging performers , effective pacing , a decent villain to hiss . not even sean connery , blustering about without the faintest idea why his character does anything , can pump up the charisma quotient of this tedious car wreck of a film . the closest recent analog to the avengers is batman and robin , but at least batman and robin had its sheer momenteum and comic-book gaudiness to salvage it . the avengers is just action sequences in search of a movie , actors in search of a reason to keep smirking . crimes against film audiences must be avenged ; the buzz of surly patrons coming out of the theater may be even more frightening than the buzz on the film . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1029,"director : richard rush . director richard rush made his last film in 1980 , a sly thriller called the stunt man which was one of the year's critical favorites . and it looks like he may have to wait another fifteen years before anyone * lets * him direct again . soon , however , it appears that capa may also be the target of intended foul play . if it were not for my personal code of ethics , i would reveal every plot twist in color of night , since they are probably the only thing which will keep anyone watching until the bitter end . on the other hand , i'm not even sure it's necessary . color of night is so sledgehammer-subtle that it would surprise me if anyone couldn't figure out the identity of the killer in the first scene in which the individual appears . sadly , it's just one of the many ways they treat the audience like it's made up of morons . in one sequence , the killer uses a car to push another car off the top level of a parking garage , endowed with a supernatural foreknowledge of exactly where willis is going to be walking below . then there are more basic matters of stupidity , such as the condition from which the film takes its title , willis' inability to see red after the death of his patient . it has absolutely no bearing on the story , is sloppily presented through occasional perspective shots , and is just another example of the offensively simplistic psychology employed by the screenwriters . the main question is whether the true criminals are the writers or the actors . but who was the most abysmal ? the whole bunch should have their sag privileges suspended . color of night was the subject of a much-publicized battle with the mpaa over explicit sex scenes which threatened to earn it an nc-17 rating , but don't be duped . color of night is about as sexy as a lump of cold mashed potatoes , and less aesthetically pleasing . it's also extremely violent , particularly in the last fifteen minutes which includes some intensely unpleasant business with a nail gun . in 1980 richard rush clearly knew how to make a good movie . i guess directing isn't exactly like riding a bike . or in this case , like driving a garbage truck .

"" that phrase kept running through my head as i sat through the jerky boys . somehow , two obnoxious losers had managed to parlay a fascination with juvenile humor and prank phone calls into an incredibly popular pair of audio releases and a movie deal . and the worst thing is , * none * of it is funny . the jerky boys is a terrible idea badly executed . and it will undoubtedly be extremely profitable . let us begin here : the idea of building a movie around prank phone calls is somewhat mind-boggling to begin with . the jerky boys is full of shots of phones ringing , of stationary speaker phones , of people talking on the phone . i'm hard-pressed to think of any way such a format could have been turned into riveting cinema . then again , the jerky boys never had to be riveting cinema . this is a movie about one thing , giving two idiots a chance to do their schtick , which consists entirely of insults , threats and silly voices . in a strange way , it's a little like the old elvis presley movies , in which it didn't matter what was going on in the plot , as long as elvis got a chance to sing . that was what the people were coming for . i have listened to the "" jerky boys "" cd , and i think it is spectacularly unfunny , but there could be some minor entertainment value in the befuddled reactions of the recipients of the calls . of course , that simply is not possible in a movie ; everyone is in on the gag , so you end up with a lot of reaction shots of actors fuming in mock frustration . and there are few things sadder than the fact that one of those actors is alan arkin . much has been and will be written about the jerky boys as not simply a bad movie , but as part of a horrible trend , the logical successor ( if logical is the word i want to use ) to the popularity of dumb and dumber , "" beavis and butthead "" and the like . not only does treating the jerky boys in this way give it far more sociological importance than it deserves , it insults those other examples by comparison . as bad as dumb and dumber was , at least someone was trying ; as stupid as "" beavis and butthead "" can be , at least they are rooted in satire . the jerky boys is simply junior high school humor aimed at junior high schoolers . it is aimed squarely at those who are guaranteed to burst into uproarious and self-righteous laughter at swishy gay stereotypes and copious expletives . if hearing someone intone the word "" liverlips "" several times is your idea of yuks galore , then by all means toss your $7 into the jerky boys' coffers . i suspect few moviegoers old enough to get into this movie legally will waste their money or their time .

"" john landis' 1981 an american werewolf in london was hardly an inviolable classic , but it was crafty and creative , a comic horror film which was both genuinely scary and genuinely funny . an american werewolf in paris , on the other hand , is genuinely unwatchable -- a collection of bad ideas thrown onto the screen without any apparent consideration to little details like coherence or appeal to an audience . the tragedy is that director anthony waller proved he could mix tension and comic relief quite effectively in his debut feature mute witness . what follows is so misguided on so many levels that it becomes horrifying for all the wrong reasons . the male leads fumble with inane dialogue including such gen x-authentic ripostes as "" this is madness ! "" ; the attempts at humor range from turning a pair of undead characters into fourth-rate rejects from the frighteners , to the wildly hilarious conceit that andy -- get this ! -- keeps bumping his head on everything in sight . waller directs it all as though guided by the humanitarian desire just to get it over with , with baffling unexplained resolutions , leading to a cringe-inducing happy ending which looks like it was stolen from some mid-80s shlock comedy starring andrew mccarthy . it's all the more aggravating when a film this sloppy pretends to be interested in making some sort of social statement . the primary villains in paris are a group of pseudo-skinheads who have intentionally infected themselves with were-blood so that they might more efficiently rid french society of its contaminating elements -- vagrants , junkies , american tourists . if the point was to make americans feel better about encountering mere attitude in paris rather than flesh-rending canine teeth , mission accomplished . if waller's intent was to offer some metaphorical indictment of who-knows-what , it's lost in his frantic story-telling long before we can nod in socially-conscious superiority . some viewers will undoubtedly trek to paris simmply to see a genre film , but even they are likely to be disappointed . the computer-generated werewolves are thoroughly unimpressive , and the transformation scene tossed off so quickly you'll be instantly nostalgic for rick baker's incredible makeup effects from london . the script makes its token attempts to spice up the werewolf legend with a few new details and some pseudo-science , but none of it generates thrills or scares ( just a couple of moderately effective gross-outs ) . if they want to add a new twist to lycanthropic mythology , here's a suggestion : anyone who makes a werewolf movie this bad becomes one of them . the line to fire the silver bullets forms behind me . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

"" such is the way in hollywood these days . besides , with the paucity of good roles for women , talented actresses like madeleine stowe and mary stuart masterson will jump at that chance to shoot guns . the problem is that these prefabricated films almost never bring along a script . bad girls is always either hopelessly cliche or insufferably stupid--and usually both . the women and the gang of thieves repeatedly cross paths until it becomes clear that this movie ain't big enough for the both of 'em . bad girls is frequently so incoherent that i was forced to wonder whether director had chopped all the raw footage into two minute chunks , strewn them about on the editing room floor and pieced the film together in whatever order he happened to pick them up . screenwriters ken friedman and yolande finch couldn't be bothered with such niceties as explaining why eileen and lily might want to save cody ( at least anita was the one cody saved ) . there is not a second spent letting these characters interact first , so that there seems to be some kind of connection between them . apparently it's enough that they're sisters in the world's oldest profession . wild guess , anyone ? . . . the thing is that this subplot is not only cliche , it's put together in the least economical way possible , with the inclusion of kid jarrett's aging father ( robert loggia ) . this additional character just muddles the movie further ; in fact , i would go so far as to say that the inclusion of the entire josh subplot is unnecessary . but that would have left cody without a love interest , and we couldn't have that , now could we ? oh , but there's more , pardners . in the last two minutes , there is the suggestion that lily harbors a more intimate affection for eileen , something we are completely unaware of until the music swells to a tear-jerking crescendo which means nothing because we have been given no background . james legros makes an appearance as a simple homesteader who wins eileen's heart , but his is the only performance that isn't completely perfunctory . madeleine stowe and mary stuart masterson are two of my favorite current young actresses , and both are forced to spout dialogue which puts the "" hack "" back in hackneyed . director jonathan kaplan apparently had no idea what to do with a western , so rather than set up his own shots he tries to do his half-hearted homage to sam peckinpah , with disastrous results . whole set pieces are ripped off from the wild bunch , and kaplan's use of slow motion becomes absurdly comic . the cinematography is quite good , but a big pile of garbage is a big pile of garbage no matter what kind of filter you put over the lens . sometimes you can look at a film as bad as bad girls and see the germ of an interesting idea that was undeveloped or simply butchered , but not here . there isn't the faintest attempt to make bad girls a real examination of the plight of women in the american west ; the women are just a gimmick , unlike in the ballad of little jo . bad girls is lazy , stupid , sloppy and , worst of all , boring . they are women , hear me snore .

1037,"at those times , i wish i could become joe bob briggs , and make the recommendation to "" check it out "" based simply on explosions , naked breasts and cuban gangster-fu . but the specialist doesn't deserve such consideration . ponderous , pretentious and acted with astounding indifference , the specialist is a big fat bore with a couple of nice explosions . it's too somber to work as camp , and too tedious to work as anything else . much as one might expect , the specialist is being hyped on the pairing of box-office heavyweights stallone and stone . unfortunately , both of them spend most of the film looking as though they've just done a nyquil highball . at some point , director luis llosa needed to explain to stone that "" haunted "" and "" bored "" are entirely different emotions . stallone is even more comatose , conveying ray's deep reservoir of anguish and guilt through drooping eyelids and jaw muscle isometrics , as well as speaking in what can only be described as an impersonation of henry kissinger with a head cold . the rest of the cast is nearly as bad . eric roberts , typecast for most of his career as a lout-mouthed sleazeball , plays . . . well , a slightly more sedate sleazeball , delivering lines like "" what i want , i take "" straight out of the introduction to basic machismo handbook . and rod steiger , who was given to overacting even in his academy award-winning heyday , is appalling as the cuban godfather , doing an accent which rivals kevin costner's robin hood as the worst in recent memory . there are a couple of moments in the specialist which are worth unintentional giggles . but the specialist is simply brain-dead from top to bottom . there are almost too many examples of stupidity to single one out , but my personal favorite involves may faking her own death by tossing her wallet in with a 60-year-old corpse . i have to hand the pyrotechnics team credit for blowing up a hotel suite ; it's a fairly impressive piece of work . but that's when i should have left . come to think of it , i wish that's where i'd come in , too .

1038,"i have a great idea for a movie , one that can't miss . see , i've got coolio to do a song for the soundtrack , and about fifty athletes and celebrities to do cameo appearances . it's about professional basketball , so i'll release it right around the nba finals to guarantee added publicity . as for what the movie is actually about . . . well , that will all sort itself out eventually . i figure it will be a comedy , so i'll throw a half-dozen writers at it and take the best of whatever they come up with . maybe we'll put a gender spin on it , see if we can get some women out to see it , too . eddie is one of those phenomenally lazy films that infuriates me more than any other kind . twister , as inane as the script might have been , at least required some creative technicians ; mission : impossible , overwrought plot and all , at least involved genuine effort . eddie just sits there , hawking up a formula story without any laughs , and makes every possible bad decision when a decision is required . please raise your hand if that comes as a shock , and i will invite you to my all-night marathon of the bad news bears , major league , angels in the outfield , the mighty ducks , the big green , cool runnings and little giants . awful teams in sports comedies make miraculous turnarounds ; it's what they do . those teams usually involve kids , for a very sound comedic reason : it's funnier when they screw up , and they're more sympathetic . those which _don't_ involve kids usually have actual actors in the lead roles , for another very sound comedic reason : they generally have developed some sort of comic timing . eddie was cast under the misguided premise that it's easier to make basketball players look like actors than it is to make actors look like basketball players . perhaps that all didn't matter to anyone because there are so few punch lines , and because the whole film is one big casting gimmick . steve rash directs the spiritless script as though waving a flag of surrender and screaming , "" don't blame me , i just work here . "" perhaps it was patently obvious to him that eddie isn't a movie -- it's a cameo appearance that trips over a plot every once in a while . and those are the real jokes in eddie . nothing these individuals say or do is funny ; you are supposed to be laughing simply because you notice , "" hey , it's donald trump ! "" or "" hey , it's mujibur and sirajul ! "" it's difficult to decide whether eddie is so bad because it was so shamelessly lacking in imagination or because it can't even get the cliches in a cliche-ridden genre script right . neither is frank langella , and none of the athlete-actors have the ability to give whoopi goldberg anything to play off of . that leaves her to do her street-wise miss thang routine , but with no character , no sharp lines and no help . eddie isn't just a bad movie with a formulaic premise . it's a movie that makes you feel cheated and offended , because someone came up with a poster and a marketing plan to which they had to attach an actual movie , and you had the nerve to believe it was going to be a comedy .

1039,"right , that was a gimme . it seems that deniro has played an inordinate number of nut cases , but each one has been a distinct creation . it also seems less than coincidental that all of the aforementioned roles -- in taxi driver , cape fear and the king of comedy , respectively -- were directed by martin scorsese . scorsese knows deniro well enough , and has enough talent , to refuse to let him lapse into self-parody . the fan is an piece of hack work in which everyone involved flounders in a pointless story made even more intolerable by scott's oppressive atmospheric theatrics . that action does end up connecting the two men , a connection which doesn't make rayburn too thrilled about getting up close and personal with his fans . this is the tony scott who has ingested the simpson/bruckheimer visual motif to such an extent that he seems medically dependent on the kind of lighting which makes everyone in the film look like george hamilton ; this is the tony scott whom one suspects might never have been able to set up a shot he liked if blinds had not been invented . scott is a director who generally takes a script , actors and solid production values and grinds them into hamburger to be smothered in slow motion and a spirit-crushing soundtrack . whatever substance their might have been in the story of the fan is rendered toxic by contact with scott's "" vision . "" this is an ugly , ugly film . there is no great challenge involved in figuring out what the psychological underpinnings of this story were supposed to be , and that they might actually have made a decent film in some alternate reality . bobby rayburn is sane , but screenwriter phoef sutton fumbles any development in his character . the arrogant but superstitious superstar has a life which parallels gil's in ways so obvious that you can feel the elbow in your ribs -- a divorce , a young son , a perfectionist streak driven by their fathers , etc . -- but beyond those bits of trivia there is nothing to him . wesley snipes looks leaden most of the time , trying to find some kind of emotional core which just isn't there , and scott's direction steadfastly refuses to allow him the faintest hope of doing so . snipes is in trouble from the start with a character who makes no sense , but at least you might hope for some creative lunacy from deniro . sadly , what emerges instead is a performance which slaps together pieces of his superior work for scorsese . it's depressing to see deniro doing his own impression of himself . the fan is the kind of film which makes me angry enough to point out idiotic inconsistencies like overhead shots of candlestick ( now 3-com ) park which obviously were taken at 49er games , but the fact is that i don't need to . it is a film lacking a single character with whom to identify , without a single shot which doesn't remind you that its director cares more about the filter he has chosen than he does about his characters . that's right , tony scott . . . i'm "

1042,"director : frederik duchau . mpaa rating : g ( some scary action ) running time : 80 minutes . there are plenty of good reasons why i try to write reviews as soon as possible after seeing a film . some are purely practical , like the deadlines that stack up one against the other as friday release-date approaches ; some are philosophical , like the desire not to be influenced by any other opinions i might hear . quest for camelot has provided me with yet another reason , perhaps the best yet -- when you're dealing with a film as hopelessly bland as this one , you'll be lucky if you can remember a single detail 48 hours later . and i do mean "" blah . "" quest for camelot is one of the most ennervated animated films in recent memory , a lifeless conglomeration of elements each more instantly forgettable than the last . visually , it offers uninspired settings and lackluster character design until the appearance of a nifty computer-generated ogre . the comic relief isn't much of a relief at all , serving up a volley of pop culture pot shots ( taxi driver , dirty harry , friday the 13th , superman ) , banal bickering between the dragon's two heads and cringe-inducing voice casting like bronson pinchot and jaleel white . of course we also need to have songs , which means a truly awful bunch of david foster/carol bayer sager compositions alternating between middle-of-the-road piffle and soporific show-stoppers . director frederik duchau can't even manage to get his voice talent to sound vaguely enthusiastic ; brosnan reads the legendary king of the britons as though he needs a prozac far more than he needs excalibur . quest for camelot's story seems well-intentioned enough , empowering its misfit heroes despite the various obstacles to success they face . unfortunately , that's about all the story offers . the film moves with a deadening listlessness , as duchau bungles the few genuine bits of action with bizarre decisions like scoring a tense chase scene to the big love ballad . the choice of elwes as the voice of kayley's guide through the forest proves to be a huge mistake , reminding viewers familiar with the princess bride of westley's infinitely more engaging romantic adventures through the fire swamp with buttercup . eventually , the failure of the rest of the story makes even the empowerment message annoying , playing like an anachronistic scolding of the round table for including only fully-abled white male humans . as i vainly searched for something to hold my attention , i kept noticing the children in the theater wandering up and down the aisles , or engaged in conversations far more lively than anything on the screen . i can't imagine why a parent would subject their children to being bored silly by a film like quest for camelot , especially when adults will probably be bored even sillier . then again , i suppose there would be a bright side : two days later , they'll never even remember what they had to sit through . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1043,"a message to all you aspiring screenwriters : know your genre . don't misunderstand , i'm not suggesting a writer should limit him or herself to only one genre , or that film script formulas couldn't stand a little innovation . however , there are good reasons why you shouldn't write a farce the same way you write a biographical drama . it's about pacing , about knowing your audience , about delivering the emotions the genre promises to deliver . his chosen style is arch dialogue and lots of it , which works out just fine when you're writing a comedy or an action film . a dark thriller is another cinematic beastie entirely . in the case of disturbing behavior , that critter is a great big turkey . it didn't necessarily have to be so foul a fowl . it's a nifty idea to create a creepshow out of the recognition that a teenager who's acting "" normal "" probably isn't . disturbing behavior , however , isn't really a creepshow . "" x-files "" and "" millennium "" veteran david nutter drags out plenty of familiar tricks ( point-of-view camera tricks , bobbing flashlights in the woods , even a score by mark snow ) , but his efforts to create mood can't get past who-cares characterizations and unexplained motivations . there's nothing frightening about the mastermind behind the plot , since he's just another one of the malicious or oblivious adults who populate films of this kind . ultimately , disturbing behavior crashes on the failure of rosenberg's script . leave aside for a moment the perfunctory romantic interest ( katie holmes ) , the forced dialogue like "" self-mutilate this , fluid boy , "" or the pointless extended riff in which gavin hips steve to the startling revelation that -- gasp ! disturbing behavior is simply a miserable thriller , because rosenberg rarely bothers to build any tension into his scenes . sure , he has people jump out to go booga-booga every once in a while . that doesn't add up to a second of genuine suspense , even when our heroes find themselves the next candidates for clockwork orange style "" treatment . "" the film merely tears along from start to finish in a brisk 80 minutes , and when it's all said and done the only thing you'll remember is how ridiculous it all is . disturbing behavior isn't a lousy thriller because it tries to be funny . "" the x-files "" has successfully paired satire and scares , as have the two scream films . it helps , however , if the humor supports character development , or perhaps elicits a laugh once in a while ( all right , the blue ribbons' olivia newton-john-playing yogurt shop hangout is worth a chuckle ) . no , disturbing behavior is a lousy thriller because it never tries to be thrilling . it's just a big dumb goof , cynically pitched at youth with sex , violence , loud music and a story that doesn't make a shred of sense . having made two recent films with michael bay , rosenberg's mistake is understandable . but if you're going to write an action film , you'd better not try to make it a suspense film . _that's_ scary . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

"" in an even more depressing development , kumble may actually have the _best_ grasp of the source material . ryan phillippe , in a valiant but grossly misguided effort to do some acting , spends virtually the entire film aping john malkovich's performance in stephen frears' 1988 dangerous liaisons . every inflectionless line reading , every arched eybrow , every lascivious double-entendre is familiar , with no apparent adjustment for the fact that sebastian is a contemporary teenager instead of an 18th century nobleman . gellar is only a bit better in the lip-curling glenn close role , while selma blair plays cecile not as simple and innocent , but with a fumbling idiocy that makes her every moment on screen unbearable . only reese witherspoon brings a shred of dignity to the proceedings , continuing to show a wonderful presence for a young actress and an interest in finding something human in her character . unfortunately , that's an interest her director doesn't share . i suppose it shouldn't be surprising that cruel intentions is just another in a long line of glossy high school audience flicks , another film with a mind-numbingly incessant underscore of shuffle-beats and pop songs , another vehicle for pretty girls and even prettier boys to pose for their fans . it is sad , however , that these filmmakers have to keep picking promising source material for their libretti , then demonstrating no concern for that material whatsoever . it's a stupid and pandering film which will probably appeal to its audience perfectly , leaving the rest of us to sit back and wait for the inevitable "" moby dick , but with teenagers .

1052,"all right , i'll admit it : i'm guilty of a bias towards writers . perhaps it's the part of me that identifies with them , or the romantic image of a guy alone in a room staring down a blank sheet of paper in a battered manual smith-corona until the paper blinks first . the fact is that when i feel a project has gone sour , the writer is frequently the last target of my wrath , and the first one to get the benefit of the doubt . not this time . i can't think of a director alive who could have done anything with cops & robbersons , or an actor who could have made it watchabel . to call this script inept would be to give it more credit than it deserves . it is exceedingly difficult to imagine what bernie somers was thinking when he started putting this mess together . there isn't a single original situation or character to be found , but that can be said of eight scripts out of ten that come out of hollywood . the more telling point is that somers didn't seem to have a clue where to go with this story . the predictable resolution would have been for milquetoast norman to discover an inner reserve of strength and end up saving the day . but even that simplistic an answer seems to be beyond his grasp . norman begins and ends the film exactly the same , and there isn't even a pat answer provided for why there is anything different in the way his family would treat him . please , my heart can't take any more surprises . the biggest losers , however , are probably the two names above the title . still , it would have been nice if he hadn't walked through the film as though he were still stunned by the cancellation of his talk show . he's not even as endearingly incompetent as the vacation series' clark griswold , just deathly boring . jack palance doesn't fare much better , but he does have an innate gruff charm that transcends the role as written ; however , that still doesn't explain why the robbersons seem so instantly drawn to jake despite his abusiveness , nor why jake eventually reciprocates . even at bargain prices , that's two bucks a laugh . * that's * a crime .

1053,"so much for avoiding comparisons . lost souls isn't just bad because it's not as good as the exorcist . it's bad because it's yet another exercise in moody production values supporting an utterly weightless story . gifted cinematographer janusz kaminski ( who worked with steven spielberg on schindler's list and saving private ryan ) makes his directing debut with lost souls , and he trots out plenty of visual goodies to tart up the proceedings . unfortunately , they're the sort of visual goodies that just make you chuckle at their obviousness . there are jagged edits and low-angle shots intended to evoke evil through obscurity . and there are plenty of shots of slowly-dripping water , which apparently has become the standard-issue portent of satanic antics . on exactly one occasion , kaminski's freaky imagery evokes a shiver . for the other 94 minutes of lost souls , it evokes a sense of desperation . and it's no wonder he's desperate , considering the script he's working with . it's one thing for a film about the prince of darkness to be melodramatic , or overwrought , or even silly . it's quite another for it to be an outright bore . lost souls is an incredibly monotonous experience , never once working up a really good scare or a palpable sense of unease . it doesn't develop anything resembling momentum towards a satisfyingly harrowing conclusion , which makes it all-too-easy to dwell on the sluggishly paced expository scenes . ryder spends the film looking vaguely tormented , while chaplin spends the film looking puzzled and _then_ vaguely tormented , and there's no reason whatsoever to care about either one of them . it sometimes seems that every part of lost souls that could have inspired a genuinely visceral reaction has been edited out , leaving an indistinct morass of gloomy cinematography in its stead . occasionally lost souls shakes itself from its coma-inducing torpor just long enough to be aggressively dumb . at the very least , such foolishness provides a distraction the rest of lost souls can't be bothered with . there's no excuse for a movie about the primal forces of evil to make satan's influence seem so banal . lost souls could have remained on new line's shelf for another twenty-five years , and no one would have missed it . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"" please , somebody throw me a pair of knee pads , 'cause they're aching from where i'm slapping them . of course , adam sandler fans would likely consider such a sarcastic dismissal the whining of an out-of-touch guy who just doesn't get how brilliantly hysterical sandler is . and such a predictable view might be remotely defensible if not for the fact that sandler himself is reduced to the status of straight man for most of the film . little nicky finds sandler mugging and doing the requisite silly voice , yet generally shrinking into the background while his supporting characters toss out the lame punch lines . this is a film that asks you to laugh harder at a performance by quentin tarantino than a performance by adam sandler . if you need to know anything more to keep you away , your soul is already lost . little nicky finds a brief spark of life late in the film when reese witherspoon turns up as an angel in a heaven that's more like a sorority house . the gags about giggling cherubim are at least moderately amusing , and witherspoon continues to show the comic chops that made her so good in election . you don't need to waste time being outraged by a film about a hero from hell , or by its stupidity and crass humor . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1055,"screenplay : alan zweibel and andrew scheinman . director : rob reiner . in 1987 , director rob reiner brought to the screen a satirical fantasy that was thought to be unfilmable , william goldman's the princess bride . though uneven , it basically worked thanks to a genuine sense of whimsy and goldman's own clever adaptation . the relative success of the princess bride would seem to suggest that if anyone could make a movie out of alan zweibel's goofy fable north , it would be reiner . instead , he has turned out a smug , tedious and wrong-headed mess which wraps the moral of the wizard of oz in a thoroughly unappealing package . for a few moments at the very beginning , north looks like it might be on the right track . there is a clever little sequence showing north as a brilliant student , a top athlete and a budding star of the musical theater , pitched at just the right level of low-key surreality ; a bit later , a series of parents chastise their children with all the things that "" north wouldn't "" do . in order for the fairy-tale one-dimensionality of these parents to work , they all need to represent something unique , not interchangeable levels of stupidity . most surprising , reiner paces everything at a crawl , including a production number in the texas sequence which should have pumped some life in the proceedings . instead , it's just another part of an 89 minute film which feels 85 minutes too long . there is yet another massive misstep with an emphasis on the subplot involving mathew mccurley as the miniature machiavelli and jon lovitz as his attorney-toady . mccurley is allowed to chew the scenery , lisping ruthless-beyond-his-years dialogue and mincing about in suspenders and slicked back hair ( as sure a sign of cinematic evil as a "" 666 "" tattoo ) . cringing is lovitz's forte , and he gets to do a lot of it , playing to all of his worst instincts . the youth revolt might have worked with a lighter touch , but reiner makes it too nasty , darkened further by a murder plot which engenders a pointless chase . where did so much talent go so dreadfully wrong ? elijah wood , a talented young actor , is a rather obnoxious north , taking the book's more measured nine-year-old protagonist and turning him into an adolescent packing a serious attitude . reiner probably called in every favor he had to pepper north with cameos , but they serve only to show that it's possible for an entire supporting cast to be as bored making a film as the audience is watching it . perhaps the biggest mystery of north is for what audience it was intended . it's too slow and full of dopey in-jokes to keep kids interested , and too simplistic for adults .

"" while some might argue ( and suicide statistics might support ) that this is a case of art imitating life , it is becoming far too predictable to toss a psychiatrist with personal demons into a suspense plot as flavoring ; they are the msg of the psychological thriller . surely there's a happy , well- adjusted shrink out there somewhere . well , not in silent fall , and the inclusion of that tired standby is just one of the many , many things wrong with this good-looking but gimmicky thriller . i don't think i'm breaking any new ground when i say that richard dreyfuss , talented though he may be , is a ham . and if there is anything more unintentionally amusing than watching a ham act , it is watching him try desperately * not * to be a ham . in silent fall , director bruce beresford has dreyfuss wandering around in a daze of what is supposed to be self-pity , but instead looks mostly like a particularly bad hamlet . in the one scene where dreyfuss plays dreyfuss , rattling off multiple voices in an attempt to calm tim , it's almost a relief . unfortunately , that is the level at which beresford has everyone pitch the performances ; you only know they're alive because they blink . liv tyler ( daughter of aerosmith's steven tyler in her first major role ) is lovely , but lacks any screen presence , and her big emotional scenes are truly laughable . from start to finish , silent fall is just so sluggish that i felt i was being hypnotized . it's even harder to stay awake once you realize the preposterous story that you are being asked to swallow . most ridiculous of all is tim's special talent , and not so much because it's impossible to believe his tape-recorder memory . rather , it is the mimicked voices dubbed over tim's lips which cross the line into silliness , and every time they are used they just get sillier . of course , a fundamental problem with silent fall is that it's a mystery where everyone seems too stupid to figure out the obvious . while there are moments in that relationship which work quite well , they lead to the film's single most infuriating scene , a miracle cure for tim at a crucial moment . for a film that wants to appear serious in its treatment of a perplexing medical condition , it traffics in solutions which are far too pat , and acts as a slap in the face to everyone who has ever had to live with autistic individuals by suggesting that all it takes to bring them out of it is just a little more love .

1058,"screenplay : al franken . director : harold ramis . it is really as simple as that . we can only find evidence of a benevolent god in the fact that hans & franz the movie and coffee talk the movie were scrapped in development ( that is not a joke ) . not only is this latest "" saturday night live "" character spinoff incoherent and unfunny , its basic idea and tone are just appallingly wrong-headed . they had their moments , primarily because al franken is one of the few performers associated with snl in the last decade who doesn't appear to have had all his subtlety surgically removed ; indeed , his sing-song delivery is good for the film's few laughs . mostly , it's just deadly slow . what is _unintentionally_ funny about stuart saves his family is the movie-of-the-week melodrama of the smalley family segments . although there are a few flashbacks to stuart's youth which are played strictly for laughs ( unsuccessfully ) , the majority of the interactions are intended to be poignant or serious . this decision is baffling , because franken appears to have forgotten the premise behind the "" daily affirmation "" sketches . they were parodies of the touchy-feely self-help movement , deriving most of their humor from goofy over-reliance on new age mantras like stuart's ubiquitous "" and that's . . . the schizoid combination of humorless comedy and misplaced sentimentality ( including a score by the ever-more-saccharine marc shaiman ) makes for a truly uncomfortable ride . it is clear that al franken had two basic choices when it came to making a stuart movie : keep stuart a caricature in an episodic story , or make him more real in an actual narrative . big mistake . i said franken had two basic choices . make that three : he could have chosen not to do the movie at all . _that_ would have been the smart choice .

"" however , in trying to combine ocean's eleven with reservoir dogs , bishop has cranked out a script with so much utterly ridiculous dialogue that you might not even notice that you don't care a thing about anyone or anything in mad dog time . gabriel byrne is the worst offender , trying to make his irish accent sound like brooklyn italian while blathering on about other characters in lines which mistake simple , inane rhymes and alliteration for cleverness . with nothing to say and a truly grating way of saying it , bishop resorts to trotting out cameos of guys who don't seem to belong on the same planet , let alone in the same movie . paul anka and richard pryor ( whose appearance seems not only unnecessary , but just plain cruel ) ? it doesn't matter that none of them has anything to do except show off a skin tone which , whether natural or induced by lighting or makeup , makes many of them look like prime candidates for the george hamilton memorial melanoma wing of cedars-sinai . at times , bishop seems to be making a desperate attempt to convince the audience that he is aware of the ludicrous excesses in mad dog time , giving goldblum a couple of meta-conscious lines which refer to characters , situations or dialogue . there are even a couple of moderately inspired moments , like having dreyfuss and reynolds , owners of two of the most distinctive laughs in hollywood , cackling away as they face each other . but when a film-maker spends this much time subjecting viewers to a story which exists only as a place to put his obnoxious rat pack stand-ins and have them mouth labored , grossly unfunny lines , he loses the right to pretend it's all a lark . the actors may have had fun playing versions of frankie , sammy , dean and the boys , but that fun isn't likely to be shared by an audience . mad dog time is a self-indulgent homage masquerading as hipster cinema . worse yet , it's like the cannonball run with cocktails and shark-skin .

1061,"director : peter hyams . mpaa rating : r ( graphic violence , profanity ) running time : 110 minutes . don't be misled by advertising which suggests that the relic is some sort of sublimely spooky thriller , because it is nothing of the kind . if you sit through the film long enough ( and several people at the screening i attended threw in the towel somewhere before the end of the third reel ) , you many begin to wonder if you have stumbled through a time warp back to the early 1980s , when horror films were an excuse to play "" can you top this "" with graphic depictions of murders . for all its ostensibly classy trappings , the relic is simply a mad slasher film with a monster instead of a maniac , as relentlessly violent and unpleasant as any film in recent memory . if you saw wes craven's current horror homage/satire scream , you are acquainted with the "" rules "" of horror films ; if you didn't see scream , you can learn most of them from the relic . splitting up a group is also a sure sign of carnage to come , especially if one person alone is carrying a flashlight or investigating any sort of strange noise . you can also count on at least one startled animal to provide a gratuitous shock to the system , to be followed closely by something genuinely horrifying . these elements are familiar for some bad reasons -- usually laziness -- but also for the good reason that , when put to good use , they can be part of a truly tense film . the original alien was a classic bug hunt crafted with such style by ridley scott that everything old seemed new again . peter hyams pretends to be interested in that kind of primal chiller , but he has neither the patience nor the skill for it . the multi-attributed script tosses personality quirks at its character hoping something might stick , but only audra lindley as an acerbic coroner seems remotely human . more often the script resorts to exposition enhancers like the two kids who turn up to ask what miller's character does for a living ( there's nothing like turning a screenplay into a catechism to make sure no one is confused ) . hyams , who has always acted as his own cinematographer , shoots everything with as little light as possible , clearly under the impression that atmosphere can be manipulated with a dimmer switch ; meanwhile , the last half of the relic is edited with a gross disregard for anything resembling building tension . the relic just gets louder , darker and more hectic with each passing minute , as hyams repeatedly confuses murky with moody . there is also something terribly dishonest about the way the relic is shot , because there is virtually nothing creepy about it . there are easily a dozen severed heads which roll through the 110 minutes of the relic , and people are torn apart with such regularity during the last 50 minutes that it no longer matters how quickly the light shines on the corpse or how rapid the edit is . at that point , the relic becomes a turkey shoot where so many anonymous individuals are killed that the survival of the two main protagonists doesn't matter . the relic is an ugly and stupid film , which is bad enough . it also proves to be a terribly dehumanizing one .

1062,"for the record , i don't tend to put much stock in conspiracy theories . call me a starry-eyed optimist if you must , but i think people are capable of quite enough selfish nastiness on an individual basis , and that that very same selfishness makes cooperative nastiness an endeavor riddled with problems . when it comes to hollywood , however , i might be willing to make an exception . studios just may be conspiring to sap from our brains the ability to recognize clumsy stories which make only the faintest sense . by comparison to the crimes shadow conspiracy perpetrates on an unsuspecting audience , the crimes in its so-called plot seem positively benign . sheen appears to be basing his film career on playing the dupe ( he was also a patsy sniffing out dirty doings in terminal velocity and the arrival ) , but if he could be suckered into taking on a script like this , perhaps he's not doing all that much acting . shadow conspiracy , credited to the writing tandem of adi hasak and ric gibbs , appears to be the product of screenplay software , introducing hackneyed situations and characters without enough energy to make the cliches tolerable . the betrayal , the chase scene , the narrow escape . . . all the ingredients are there , but they sit there flatly without the benefit of a single moment of imagination if the basic material is bad , then the execution is even worse . the direction ( by rambo's george p . cosmatos ) and editing ( by robert a . ferretti ) in shadow conspiracy are inept to a degree that seems almost ( conspiratorially ? ) designed . one chase flashes from a luxury hotel to a homeless encampment to a sewer out of les miserables with a blissful disregard for continuity ; scenes designed for tension become inconsequential blurs , and characters wander through the narrative for an hour before you have a clue what they are supposed to be doing . cosmatos doesn't even understand basic principles of drama , making a point of showing us a tricky-to-unlatch seat-belt which then plays no further part in the story , an un-fired gun which probably sent chekhov to spinning in his grave . that climactic scene at least provides a moment of absurdist fun , the only one shadow conspiracy has to offer unless you count the floppy hats hamilton favors which are sure to gain a white house correspondent professional respect . mostly , it is just a plodding and somber piece of nonsense which seems to expect brownie points for showing us all the ways the government can keep an eye on us , and ends with an ominous tracking shot to the perspective of a spy satellite . personally , i feel more threatened by the prospect of lazy , pre-fabricated thrillers foisted off on the american viewing public as entertainment . if the people who brought us shadow conspiracy are supposed to be the ones to shine the light on sinister conspiracies which threaten our freedoms , all i have to say is : who's watching the watchmen ?

"" "" yeah , "" robin/billy would then chime in , "" we had a great time making it . "" whereupon would ensue much good-natured riffing between the two , guaranteed to have the hosts chuckling merrily as we returned to the studio . for those uninitiated in promo-speak , allow me to provide a translation . the real plot of fathers' day is robin williams and billy crystal running around being robin williams and billy crystal . that plot shouldn't have been too hard to pull off . crystal and williams are funny , talented men , and the screenwriting team of lowell ganz and babaloo mandel has produced charmers like splash , parenthood and city slickers . fathers' day , however , isn't merely disappointing . it is one of the laziest and most ineptly constructed comedies of the decade . i spent 101 minutes staring at a screen in blank-faced astonishment , waiting for this group of talented people to show me something remotely entertaining . of course , i knew the answer to that question . they were thinking that they had robin williams and billy crystal , and that everything else would just sort itself out . fathers' day is filled with scenes where it looked like the script consisted of the phrase "" robin does something crazy here . "" it is the rare film which has made good use of williams' improvisational skills -- good morning , vietnam comes to mind . more frequently , a careless creative team like this one will use williams as a comedic "" in-a-gadda-da-vida "" drum solo , filling time between "" fade in "" and "" fade out . "" crystal isn't even _that_ lucky , consigned with the rest of the cast to picking up whatever scraps williams leaves behind . he plays the felix unger in this odd couple road show , maintaining the same vaguely perturbed expression for roughly the entire film . you might think fathers' day would be built around the conflict between the opposing personalities of the two leads -- crystal as the uptight lawyer and williams as the unhinged creative type -- but you'd be wrong . williams and crystal hardly raise their voices to one another , perhaps fearing that the audience only wants to see them as funny chums . respectively , they provide the opportunity to watch a mosh pit full of head-butting and a port-a-potty sliding down a hillside . thanks for coming . most critics tend to reserve their greatest outrage for films featuring pauly shore , chris farley or even jim carrey , perhaps believing that moronic physical comedy is what's wrong with modern film-making . i consider fathers' day more contemptible by far . whatever else one might think about farley or carrey , they give everything they've got to a role . the performances are lifeless , the plot incorporates that over-used trope of the workaholic who gets religion about family life , and the dialogue is so devoid of creativity that it re-cycles a gag about the odds of lou gehrig dying of lou gehrig's disease ( comparative stories about how long ago you first heard that one mailed to this address , please ) . i'm sure the stars had a wonderful time making fathers' day , just like burt reynolds , dom deluise and company had a wonderful time making those cannonball run movies . as the credits started to role , i began to hope that fathers' day would include out-takes , something to justify my time . they also would have provided a fitting post-card coda for a film which amounts to a working vacation for robin williams and billy crystal at our expense : "" having a good time -- glad you were there .

1065,"i have a theory that , in an earlier stage of development , the premise for a simple wish went something like this : murray ( martin short ) , who aspires to being the first male fairy godmother , turns out to be completely inept at the job , but an affirmative action mandate forces the godmothers to admit him . this would be before the real-world affirmative action debate heated up , forcing controversy-shy universal executives to drop that angle entirely . the theory , i'll admit , is based on no evidence in the version of a simple wish which actually made it to the screen . the alternative , unfortunately , is that the story never made a shred of sense at _any_ point in its development . it's the kind of exasperating kiddie fantasy where stuff just happens , without any character , story or internal logic to guide it . of course , the stuff which does happen may be plenty to satisfy young viewers . the special effects are , admittedly , temporarily distracting . martin short , who should be taken only in small doses even on his best days , turns murray into a flinching , snorting and generally annoying creation without a glimmer of charm . mara wilson , who was so appealing in last year's delightful matilda , barely registers here at all , while francis capra registers far too often as wilson's big brother . there is not a single likeable character in the film , turning every scene into a long wait for some kind of goofy visual effect to snap you out of your stupor . all of these problems make the gaping hole at the center of the film all the more evident . a simple wish is based around a high-concept premise -- a male fairy godmother , and an incompetent one at that -- yet not once is there any attempt to explain why he wanted to be a fairy godmother , how he managed to become one , or why no one is keeping an eye on him . in fact , a simple wish is comprised of nothing but missed opportunities and half-developed ideas . does it matter that murray is using a broken wand for much of the film ? time and again , a simple wish wanders from scene to scene as though blissfully unconcerned about arriving at anything resembling a point . then again , maybe someone got cold feet and stripped it of its point . it's more charitable , i think , to imagine the darkly satirical film a simple wish might have been than to dwell on the muddled mess it turned out to be . calling a critic 'elitist' is like calling an accountant 'mathist .

"" i'm not suggesting that a film based on the czechoslovakian brothers necessarily would have been funnier than this one . it's almost axiomatic at this point that trying to turn a five minute sketch into a full-length feature is a very , very bad idea ( particularly when those five minute sketches are only funny for the first two ) . the fact is , it's briefly amusing watching the butabis' synchronized head-swaying to the beat , or listening to them spew out decrepit pick-up lines . but the rest of a night at the roxbury demonstrates exactly what kills sketch-to-feature concepts : once the sketch material is exhausted , you've got to humanize characters that are much funnier as broad caricatures . when a night at the roxbury isn't just plain boring , it's actually kinda sad . in case the taut visage of loni anderson wasn't frightening enough , the film wheels out richard grieco as himself , doughy and mascara-covered . the idea that grieco still carries enough clout to get our loser protagonists into the ultra-exclusive roxbury is one of the film's best jokes ; dana carvey would have dismissed him in an old "" snl "" sketch with an admonition to "" wait at the bar . "" and it's saddest of all being a member of the audience watching the script scramble in search of a concept on which to hang something vaguely humorous , and watching director john fortenberry's clunky comic pacing . ultimately , there are about five decent laughs and another handful of chuckles in a night at the roxbury , and i was counting those in the stony audience around me , not my own . i'll give ferrell and kattan credit for a clever combo-poke at say anything . . . and the graduate , and i'll give major credit to the music supervisor for coming up with great song cues for a number of scenes . otherwise , a night at the roxbury continues two noteworthy "" saturday night live "" traditions : loser brothers infatuated with trendy night-spots , and generally unwatchable feature films . looks like i could pick up right where i left off . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1074,"screenplay : kevin williamson . director : robert rodriguez . there's something very strange going on at ohio's herrington high in the faculty . a world-shaking case of deja vu . deconstructionist screen scribe kevin williamson managed a tightrope act across the fine line between homage and outright theft in scream and scream 2 . in the faculty , he stomps that fine line into a fine paste . it's a monster movie that could not exist without the existence of other -- and much better -- movies . of course , some will argue that such is entirely the point of any williamson project , that he shows off the conventions of genre films so he can revitalize them . the problem is that there is nothing remotely revitalizing about the faculty . sure , it's a movie movie , but its quotes are as witlessly regurgitated as in any number of recent leslie nielsen projects . instead of having something clever to say about cliches , it simply recycles them , tossing in the occasional reference to "" the puppet masters "" or alien's ripley as though it suddenly makes all the trite characterizations and profanely insult-filled dialogue tolerable . even elijah wood's wide-eyed genuineness and some pseudo-analysis of teenage desire for conformity can't rescue the faculty from feeling exactly like the "" attractive teens in jeopardy "" tales it supposedly derides . if the faculty proves anything , it's how much williamson needs wes craven . both scream films featured chilling sequences which could stand with the best the genre had to offer ; they showed what chould be great about horror films even as they showed what could be awful about them . robert rodriguez -- who , if nothing else , has always shown that he has an electrifying sense of cinematic pacing -- seemingly has no idea what to do with this material . the faculty drifts sluggishly from character to character as though they actually mattered , and the few action sequences are designed to show off alien effects . every opportunity for genuine creativity is turned into yet another self-satisfied commentary on how every science-fiction story is really a rip-off of some other science-fiction story . there are a couple of amusing moments in the faculty -- a football game in which the herrington team "" infects "" the opposition during dogpile tackles , for instance -- but even most of those are taken from other films . williamson's name is supposed to make this a knowing satire of alien takeover films like invasion of the body snatchers , but there was more inventive humor in a piece of cheese like 1985's killer yogurt film the stuff . the faculty merely adds to the list of lame science fiction films for someone else to satirize . . . and maybe even get it right next time . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1079,"director : josef rusnak . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 99 minutes . it would be easier -- and kinder -- to think of the thirteenth floor as a simple case of bad timing . that much head-tripping could be wearying under the best of circumstances , and the thirteenth floor is far from the best of circumstances . this is genre film-making at its most superficially plot-driven , compounding its shallow characterizations with a ridiculous degree of self-importance . there's nothing remarkably innovative about the film's premise at this point , but director/co-writer josef rusnak can't be faulted for bringing up the rear of the virtual reality parade . he can certainly be faulted , however , for the way he approached that premise . the thirteenth floor apparently wants hall's existential crisis to matter , yet the film never gives us enough background to understand hall , his friendship with fuller , or any of his anxieties . it often appears that key scenes of character development have been edited out and replaced by expository dialogue , leaving little but essential plot-advancing events and craig bierko's dead-eyed performance . that makes it virtually impossible for the story to develop any depth , or for hall's romance with a mysterious woman ( gretchen mol ) to be anything but functional . when the film's real "" villain "" shows up for the first time with about 15 minutes left , it's obvious that rusnak's primary goal is moving the story , character development be hanged . a science-fiction thriller can work , of course , without much profound commentary on the human condition ; heaven knows the matrix wasn't out to score philosophical brownie points . the matrix also didn't make the mistake of pretending to be anything more than it was , treating its subject matter with a playful , giddy energy . the thirteenth floor is one of those bleak , somber exercises in which the gloom is meant to suggest significance but instead makes it even more impossible to enjoy the story . on only one occasion , involving the confusion of fuller's simulation counterpart , does the thirteenth floor aspire to some kind of understanding . most of the time it's a plodding bore , grinding through the plot as though its themes were medicinally good for you instead of the stuff of paperback novels . i suppose it's praiseworthy that the thirteenth floor does work at providing clues for its plot twists instead of dropping them in your lap . mueller-stahl and d'onofrio are solid in their dual roles , almost making up for the blank attractiveness of mol and bierko . the film certainly achieves the atmosphere it's aiming for ; unfortunately , that atmosphere provides neither entertainment nor insight . even if you're prepared to overlook the inevitable head-scratching convolutions of plot , you're not likely to care about where they're taking you . i can imagine an alternate reality in which film-makers have figured out there's nothing more to say about alternate realities , at least for the time being . it must be a better place than this . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1080,"this is my father is a family affair , and not just because its subject matter involves family ties . so warm and wonderful was the experience , evidently , that no one bothered to pay much attention to telling an interesting , coherent story . this is my father is a sprawling mess of a film that tries to tell several stories , each one more irritating than the last . the trouble begins in this is my father with a present-day prologue that does a miserable job of setting up the premise . in fact , the entire framing story feels like little more than a series of ridiculous contrivances . unfortunately , that romance is so ridiculously apocryphal that it's not clear until the last ten minutes which of two girls is supposed to be his own lovely lass . every moment set in the present is a wearying bore , leading this viewer to a stone-faced demand that the flashback sequences better be worth it . they're not . they're an improvement , to be certain , but there's so much extraneous business going on that the central romance gets lost . the romance itself ultimately makes no sense from fiona's side , with nary an attempt to explain why the spunky girl would be charmed by the socially inept kieran . aidan quinn fares better as a man-child unsure how to handle a romantic relationship , but the story places too much tragic weight on his shoulders . they may have been most interested in re-creating the sights and sounds of 1939 ireland . the problem is that you really can't tell what they wanted to do with any degree of certainty . this is my father never pulls its two storylines together in any believable way , nor manages to make either one gripping on its own terms . the filming may have served as a pleasant , roots-exploring quinn family vacation , but we the viewers are left with the tedium of watching their home movies . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1082,"for nearly 15 minutes , chill factor actually warrants comparison to the film it tries so hard to bring to mind . for 15 minutes , it's almost speed with a thermometer instead of a spedometer . during that 15 minute chunk of the film , director hugh johnson does everything an action film director needs to do , offering plenty of close calls and nervous laughter . unfortunately , those 15 minutes occur smack in the middle of the film , between 45 minutes of excruciating introductory exposition and 45 minutes of alternatingly absurd and tedious conclusion . the burst of action seems like it's going to be the payoff for sitting through one of the longest , least interesting prologues to an action film _ever_ , a prologue which lays out brynner's feud with "" elvis's "" creator ( david paymer ) in exhaustive detail . then , almost before you get a chance to enjoy the few thrills chill factor can provide , it sends mason and arlo on a leisurely paddle down the river so they can bond over their past mistakes . and it's all downstream from there . it might have been at least remotely worth sitting through all that exposition if the characters or performances hadn't made you want everyone involved to end up chemically defoliated . cuba gooding jr . is rapidly turning into one of the most aggravating oscar-winning actors in history , a one-note performer who widens his eyes and tightens his jaw to express practically every emotion ( the direction of the corners of his mouth is the only hint as to his mood ) . his work in chill factor borders on the embarrassing , a frantic collection of over-the-top reactions that would make martin lawrence and chris tucker blush . skeet ulrich could only hope to register an emotion of any kind , using a flat delivery for even flatter lines . and colin firth squints and rasps his way through the villain role , never quite sure whether he should be a moustache-twirling melodrama baddie or tormented soldier with shattered patriotism . the absence of a sympathetic hero and solid villain damage an action film , but they're not always fatal . it can even get away with ridiculous plot developments , like the idea that a toxic chemical gas could be contained inside a traffic tunnel by blowing up both sides of the tunnel ( creating the ever-effective pile-of-rubble vacuum seal ) . but there is no way an action film can get away with so little action . chill factor just sits there , inert , for nearly its entire running time , even forgetting during its best moments to remind us of the status of its key plot element's rising temperature . it's hard to believe that a film this weightless would waste so much time on setting up the premise , then never exploit the premise . if you want to want to imagine chill factor -- and imagine why it's not even worth the time of a true-blue action fan -- think of speed , with 90 minutes of the film set at a bus stop . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1084,"starring : max von sydow , ed harris , bonnie bedelia , j . t . walsh . director : fraser c . heston . if one adds sequels , original screenplays and television adaptations , that totals roughly 50 hours of film treatment , about two thirds of which has been useful only as a mild sedative . although to state that king's works have fared poorly in translation to the screen may be to give him more credit than he is due , it is certainly true that king on screen has been far less successful than king in print . that is not likely to change with needful things . lacking the suspense to be a crossover hit like misery , or sufficient mayhem to please the freddy krueger crowd , it treads a soggy middle ground , going for cheap laughs rather than working up solid scares . there is the germ of an intriguing idea in needful things , one borrowed from ray bradbury's something wicked this way comes : what would you be willing to do for your heart's desire ? add to that the simmering hatreds and intolerance beneath the veneer of polite interaction , and there's the potential for something beyond your run-of-the-mill gore fest . screenwriter w . d . richter and director fraser c . heston set up reasonably well , but don't deliver . needful things seems to take forever to get any kind of momentum going , and when it does at last seem to be moving it runs into a brick wall of silly dialogue and shoddy acting . the latter is somewhat surprising given the reasonably talented cast . valri bromfield sneers and swears as a loony turkey farmer ; amanda plummer does a new england accented variation on her standard eccentric ; j . t . walsh seems to be channeling jack nicholson's performance from the shining , but without the charisma , as the town's pompous leading citizen . the biggest shock is von sydow , who seems completely miscast . he appears to revel in the campier elements , never bringing any genuine menace to gaunt . i suppose the blame for that lies with richter , best know as the creator of the campy cult favorite the adventures of buckaroo banzai . he seems to have been a poor choice for this job , sacrificing suspense for silly punch lines . his black-humored approach to the story just didn't work . similarly , director heston ( yes , _that_ heston's son ) doesn't quite have the deft touch required to direct suspense . he does a nice job with the fantasy sequences as gaunt entices his customers , but other elements go completely astray . he never gives his actors a sense for the proper tone , which makes it appear that harris and bedelia are acting in a different movie than everyone else . and he lays on the atmospheric smoke in gaunt's shop so thick i thought i could see it puffing in from off-camera . needful things is muddled , and in too many of the wrong hands . i did find a few moments of amusement , all of which were probably unintentional . in one scene , a jukebox skips while playing "" achy breaky heart , "" repeating the title over and over . also ironic is harris' statement that "" this is a quiet town .

1085,"director : gary sinyor . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 100 minutes . i came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor , an innocuous-enough-on-the-surface romantic comedy . it's not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity , but there it was nonetheless . i sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999 . in a word , it's the same thing that's wrong with so many movies circa 1999 : writing . more to the point , it's the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when you're telling a story about a relationship . the bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where we're expected to get dewy-eyed over any pairing of attractive , pleasant people just because they're attractive and pleasant . convinced despite his reservations that it's time to "" sh * t or get off the pot , "" jimmy proposes to anne -- very badly . it's a wacky , brewster's millions-esque premise ( acknowledged as such in one of the film's better , more self-aware lines of dialogue ) , the kind where a shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters . at least that would be the case if jimmy weren't already a world-class altruist . it's almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in the bachelor's plot development . by any human standard , the guy is impossibly selfless . and that's the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor -- the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness . there's never any tension between the two star-crossed lovers , because there's no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake . and forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation . the parade of sit-com set pieces had better be damned funny , since they're all that stands between us and a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion . i'll admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing , including ustinov's rantings about procreation and a restaurant full-to-bursting with men popping questions and champagne corks . far more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly , like the shudder-inducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortune-hunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in a church . you're never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film like the bachelor , but that's not the real problem . nor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warm-n-fuzzy conclusion it's leading up to . the problem are a beginning and middle that are equally warm-n-fuzzy -- there's no spark , no energy , no humanity . it's an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumer's digestions . we've reached a point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment don't even have a pulse . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1086,"screenplay : mark rosenthal and lawrence konner . director : barry sonnenfeld . michael j . fox is in a * deep * rut . it's a type that has worked for him , thanks to his charm and comic timing , but it puts him in danger of carrying questionable projects which seem comfortable . as a perfect example , witness for love or money , a cliche-filled would-be romantic comedy that's neither particularly romantic nor particularly funny . his specialty is doing that little something extra for the guests--walking their dogs , acquiring hard-to-get theater tickets--and raking in huge tips for his efforts . if you have to guess which choice doug will make , you haven't seen very many romantic comedies . the point is never whether they'll end up together , but simply how entertaining getting there will be . it starts promisingly enough , with a focus on doug's wheeling and dealing , but once the romantic plot kicks in there's just no energy . there's a lengthy sequence at a party involving mistaken identities and doug trying to hold everything together which was frantic but never really clicked ; after that , the film doesn't even seem to try . the situations are simply tedious . i can't begin to describe how tired i am of that stock "" we both care about each other but neither one of us will admit it so instead we'll yell at each other "" scene in romantic comedies . there are plenty of ways to establish conflict that actually occur in human life ( or perhaps i and everyone i know have just been lucky so far ) . for love or money uses up most of its best jokes and all of its originality in about ten minutes . i also had many problems with the performances . fox has spent so much time as the cocky young go-getter that he doesn't seem to know how to vary it . he also never conveys when the mild flirtation established early in their interaction becomes real romantic interest , but perhaps a better question than "" when "" is "" why . "" gabrielle anwar wanders through the film gorgeous but thoroughly uninteresting , emoting and pouting in ways that would make a high school drama teacher cringe . of the supporting players , only michael tucker as a nebbishy hotel guest is not a complete stereotype . particularly embarrassing are fascistic german hotel manager and a swishy fashion designer , but they are just the most glaring examples of a script that makes all the easy choices , and all the wrong ones . director barry sonnenfeld was a marvelous cinematographer ( miller's crossing ) , but so far only a barely serviceable director . like the addams family , for love or money is too ham-fisted , and sonnenfeld's few stylistic flourishes are lost in slow pacing and mishandled actors .

1087,"starring : sylvester stallone , wesley snipes , sandra bullock . screenplay : daniel waters and robert reneau & peter m . lenkov . director : marco brambilla . it would seem sylvester stallone has learned a lesson : give the people what they want . sly wanted to expand into comedy , but he made bad choices and audiences stayed away in droves . or my mom will shoot , hello cliffhanger . now the second coming of sly the action hero brings us demolition man , and i expect it will do similarly big business , despite the fact that it's a bloated conglomeration of failed story elements and lead balloon punch lines . the main problem with demolition man is that i never bought its underlying premise for a moment . the screenplay makes virtually no effort to explain how the authorities of the 21st century were able to convince its mainstream populace to abandon sex , drinking , smoking and profanity . it's just a pax ex machina , and it doesn't work . if that were not enough , there is the further problem of a scattered storyline with too many plot threads . for an action film , demolition man never really gets up a head of steam , spending far too much screen time on superfluous subplots . the fact is , at times demoliton man seems more intent on being a satirical comedy than an adventure . many of the gags are based on the requisite anachronisms , most notable a running string of malapropped 20th century cliches by bullock which are true groaners . we also get references to rambo ( get it ? ) and the schwarzenegger presidential library which seem like they're expected to be funny just because they're mentioned . denis leary also gets a ranting bit straight out of his stand-up routine for no apparent reason other than to give him something to say . there are times when the loopy sense of humor works , such as the rather incongruous skill programmed into spartan . however , for every one clever bit there are five hammered into the ground like the gratingly repeated penalty buzzer every time a character swears . i actually began hoping for things to blow up ; at least that was done well . as for the acting , the less said the better . snipes has perverse fun with phoenix , but he's on screen far too little , and his character is reduced to cocky one-liners . stallone is more personable than he's been in years , but he too has no character to speak of . bullock does have a character , just no recognizable talent . rob schneider of "" saturday night live "" has a funny bit part , but that's about all for bright spots . demolition man is bound to appeal to some on a very basic level ; there are great pyrotechnics , and the production design is impressive . but i found it wanting even as macho entertainment . much of the action is uninspired , annoyingly photographed or badly edited , and even that action is too long in coming . demolition man is like that old joke about a bad restaurant : the food is awful . . . and such small portions .

1088,"there was a point during mr . jones when it occurred to me that if it had been made in french , someone might have championed it as an understated bit of high culture . it's well-directed , generally well-acted , and includes several meaningful closeups and a few piano performances . it also features a story which goes absolutely nowhere . if any film this year can be said to demonstrate a visual monotone , it's mr . jones is given to grand theatrics , such as poising himself on the edge of a roof and claiming he's going to fly , or jumping onstage at a symphony to conduct the orchestra . a film like mr . jones has to walk its own very fine line , being careful not to romanticize mental illness . unfortunately , mr . is the idea that one can only truly live while on the manic side of manic depression ? both concepts are fairly distasteful , and it makes it awfully hard for the love story to generate any resonance . she is supposed to be the dynamic character in this piece , like tom cruise to dustin hoffman in rain man , but there's not a clear enough sense of where she's coming from to make where she's going compelling . mr . jones is just a case of a poorly developed basic premise . this basic premise is also undercut by a performance from richard gere which is excellent , but toned totally wrong for the film . it's a daring portrayal , never kooky just for the sake of being kooky ( like mary stuart masterson directing traffic with ping pong paddles in benny & joon ) , and willing to dig into the darker corners of this disturbed man's psyche . the problem is that gere is so good at conveying jones' dark side that dr . bowen's attraction just doesn't make any sense . these two people seem to have been thrown into bed together simply for the expendience of the story , and not because of any character motivation . jones is likely to lose most viewers , however , is a tone so muted that it's virtually inaudible . everything is slowly , painstakingly framed , even those moments which are supposed to represent mr . jones' mania . there is virtually no underscore , causing far too many scenes to come off cold and clinical . where some films beat you over the head with big emotions , mr . jones seems to dare you to find any emotional attachment . it doesn't help that some scenes are poorly lit , and that in others lena olin's dialogue is almost completely incomprehensible . i want to admire mr . jones for not leaning towards the sentimental , but it's no virtue to opt instead for comatose . mr . jones has been sitting on the shelf for a year or so , and it's easy to see why . it's a love story without much love , and a character study low on character . i was impressed by richard gere , but he alone isn't reason enough to spend two hours with mr . jones . . . now * that's * love .

1089,"screenplay : john patrick shanley . directors : dick zondag & ralph zondag . if i didn't know how long animation takes to produce , i'd swear universal had thrown it together in a few months just for that purpose . we're back is sadly uninspired kiddie fare , perhaps moderately diverting for elementary schoolers but likely to be a tedious 70 minutes for their parents . from a story standpoint , we're back is a mess . it seems to have no idea what it wants to be--fast paced adventure , goofy comedy , dark mood piece--so it throws a little bit of everything into the stew in the hope that something will work . but the chase sequences are only interesting thanks to gut-churning computer effects , the comedy is limp and the scarier segments , which are the best , come far too late . there is even an attempt at a musical production number , a lively enough james horner-thomas dolby composition called "" roll back the rock , "" but it strains so hard to be charming that it's an effort to watch . the schizophrenic tone is not necessarily a problem for a 7-year-old attention span , but the lack of continuity gave me a headache . visually , the film fares only slightly better . the prehistoric setting is appropriately gloomy , but we only see it for about a minute . most of the film takes place in a new york colored in oranges and golds , and it's just not at all interesting to look at . professor screweyes' circus is dark and creepy , but it is a real missed opportunity . directors dick and ralph zondag could have gone for a real pinocchio-style funhouse of frights , but they just let the circus sit there full of unexplored potential . they manage to pull out one truly arresting image , involving a flock of crows , but the film is almost over by that time . nothing in we're back captures the eye or the imagination . perhaps the fatal flaw in we're back is a collection of characters which might almost scrape together a personality between them . disney built its empire on carefully created and memorably performed characters , but screenwriter john patrick shanley turns in as bland a bunch as i can imagine . john goodman does a half-hearted bing crosby impression as the affable rex , charles fleischer simply recycles roger rabbit as dweeb , and felicity kendal and rene levant are each thrown a token character trait as the other dinosaurs . walter cronkite and julia child seem to be present only for the novelty of doing trademark lines to animation , and jay leno is genuinely annoying as captain neweyes' alien sidekick . the kids are not bad , nicely performed by joey shea and "" the simpsons' "" yeardley smith , but the only real fun comes from martin short as a frustrated clown in the scary circus . his antics are as random as everything else , but at least they were funny . as if the slipshod disney knockoffs ( the contract signing from the little mermaid , zoom-ins on the wide-eyed heroine ) weren't bad enough , we're back gives in to insipid moralizing . uncle walt had more respect for kids than that . it's too bad when parents' only matinee options are as monotonous as we're back . or wait for the lion king . . .

1090,"screenplay : james orr & jim cruickshank and judi ann mason . director : bill duke . let's play a little "" jeopardy . "" if you said the question was , "" why make a sequel to sister act ? "" you'd be right . it certainly wasn't because anyone had an actual idea or , if onscreen evidence serves , because whoopi goldberg was brimming over with enthusiasm to don the robes again . sister act was a simple but extremely pleasant entertainment which worked thanks to a solid set-up and lively performances . sister act 2 : back in the habit strips away the last shred of energy , originality and fun , leaving only a few good musical numbers and a stupefyingly uninteresting story . if the preceding summary betrays my antipathy , well , it was going to come out sooner or later . the irony of sister act 2 is that where so many recent sequels have done nothing by xerox the original , there was at least an attempt in this case to do something different . unfortunately , the attempt was dreadfully misguided . the charm of sister act was based on goldberg's fish out of water frustration and the interesting collection of characters in the convent . there was a plausible reason for her to be there , and a genuine conflict . in sister act 2 there's no conflict , no plausibility and nowhere for the humor to come from . screenwriters james orr , jim cruickshank and judi ann mason throw goldberg into one of the most overused situations in films , the underachieving bunch of kids who just need a tough-but-understanding teacher with a fresh perspective . even so , they at least could have played it for laughs , but there is nothing funny going on anywhere . a couple of the kids are flat out annoying , and the resolution of this story is telegraphed from the moment they appear . this is nothing but stand and deliver with a wimple . what's truly depressing is that none of the returning characters even needed to be here . kathy najimy , wendy makkena and mary wickes stay pretty much in the background , because their characters haven't been given anything to do . coburn is ostensibly the villain of the piece , but there is no effort to define his character or his motivations , so he just becomes a scowling oaf . anyone could have wandered into that classroom and it would have been the same movie . there's some small attempt to portray a balanced picture of inner city life , but basically it's disney 'n the hood . lauryn hill gives a nice performance as rita , and i did enjoy the music . but sister act 2 is supposed to be a comedy , and i did not laugh * once * . the question is , "" how many sequels to sister act should have been made ?

1091,"that irritating sound you'll be hearing for the first 20 minutes of hanging up -- more or less non-stop-- is the ringing of phones . in the context of the film , you could say the ringing phones represent the distractions that keep us from focusing on what really matters . or maybe they stand for the way we can talk and talk and talk without ever really communicating . and in the context of the film , either message would be painfully ironic . hanging up is an extruciatingly awkward piece of film storytelling -- a movie full of distractions from what really matters , a movie that talks and talks and talks without ever really communicating . it's all about evie , and ryan does her perky , weepy best trying to make evie's plight matter . too bad hanging up is such a muddle of shifting tones and undeveloped relationships that ryan's manic performance reeks less of frustration over her life than desperation over the script . every scene feels aborted in mid-thought , leaving little but the spectre of matthau trying to give some hammy charm to a character that's alternately eccentric-annoying and creepy-annoying . by that time it's far too late to make that interaction convincing or endearing , since both keaton and kudrow are playing gross caricatures of self-absorption . it's inevitable , then , that every moment between the sisters feels false , every grating attempt at bickering , bittersweet reconciliation or playful kitchen food-fighting serving as a reminder that you were expecting a movie about the ties that bind . what you get instead is a movie about people who all signed up to be in the same movie . there are so many things wrong with hanging up -- the stilted script by delia and nora ephron , the wretched editing , matthau's depressing shtick -- that it seems absurd to pick out one moment of epic miscalculation . it's a pivotal moment , one that will explain any number of issues in evie's life . . . and it's dispatched in a matter of seconds , with leachman delivering about a half-dozen lines of dialogue . that sort of incomplete , abrupt storytelling defines hanging up , a film that becomes such a fragmented collection of life moments that it's virtually impossible for the whole thing not to give you a headache . that irritating sound you'll be hearing after the phones finally stop ringing in hanging up is the dissonant buzz of movie that never has a point . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1092,"screenplay : thomas ropelewski . director : john schlesinger . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity , brief nudity ) running time : 105 minutes . you can be sure that the next best thing will find plenty of viewers unsympathetic to its message in support of unconventional family structure -- the christian coalition , for example , or the utah state legislature . we may have come a long way , baby , in matters of social tolerance , but we haven't come _that_ far . still , you would expect the people involved in making the next best thing to have the passion to turn it into a compelling story . john schlesinger is one of the few openly gay directors making hollywood films . and madonna well , i saw truth or dare , so i get the impression she's fairly familiar with alternative lifestyles . what , then , is the excuse for the next best thing turning out so generally dreary and uninspired ? as with many films , so far so good in the general concept department . it's only in the execution that the next best thing becomes an ordeal to endure . the character of abbie is the heart of the disaster , and i'd be inclined to blame screenwriter thomas ropelewski ( more on his faults to come ) if not for the screen performance tragedy that is madonna . these days , it's impossible to notice anything but that deliberate , affected speech pattern of hers . abbie does some pretty unsympathetic things over the course of the film , so it's crucial that she be played with some energy and charm . it's a performance so leaden it drags every single thing about the next best thing down along with it . with such a horrendous casting mistake at the heart of the next best thing , sapping it of any possible resonance , it's easy to tune out and spend great heaping chunks of the film mulling over its other faults . like , did ropelewski think there was a rule that any film featuring a gay character must have an aids-related sub-plot , no matter how irrelevant to the rest of the story ( hint : it could have been more relevant had there been an attempt to connect the question of surviving partners' rights to gay parents' rights ) ? why did usually reliable cinematographer elliot davis light the whole film as though we were in a cave , except for the morticia adams memorial eye , nose & throat spotlight used on madonna ? and what was with schlesinger's frequent use of fish-eye point-of-view perspectives that merely served to make a serio-comic tale occasionally border on the grotesque ? it's obvious that the next best thing wants to make a statement about inequities in the adjudication of custody matters , and question what it is that makes a parent . the statement and question are both valid , but that's all there is to this clumsy concoction . rupert everett is solid both comedically and dramatically , providing virtually all of the film's worthwhile moments , but he's the only thing about the next best thing that doesn't inspire far more head shaking than righteous indignation . sure , everyone involved was probably telling a story about which they felt deeply , and their hearts were certainly in the right place . when you're making a film , however , heart just isn't always enough . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1093,"i enjoyed its silly humor , but if the microscopic ratings were any indication , the audience for elliott's fey goofball character was severely limited . it's therefore hard to figure why a studio would green-light a project like cabin boy , particularly assuming anyone actually saw a script before shooting started . cabin boy is dumb even by the standards of a chris elliott project , depending almost entirely on elliott's dopey grin and taking far too long to get to anything with any real wit . this includes a prologue at the prep school which seems to last about twice as long as the ten minutes it actually is . elliott adopts a supremely annoying quasi-brahmin accent that makes most of his dialogue grating , and makes about twelve jokes too many based on nathanial's condescension toward common folk . then we get a bizarre cameo by david letterman , which is almost funny simply for its bald refusal to disguise his regular tv personality . in a film which runs under eighty minutes , a tedious set-up is more than a hindrance . . . it's a pre-emptive first strike . once cabin boy hits open water ( or at least as open as it gets on the sound stage ) , it's no longer actively annoying . it's also not much more funny . elliott's schtick always tends to the surreal , but as weird as things get , they remain curiously uninteresting . if any of that sounds funny on paper , well , it did to me , too . it's the execution that fails . while the bargain basement production values might be endearing to some , i found the visual gags in cabin boy painfully unfunny . some of the verbal bits work , but in their rarity i hesitate to spoil them . i think one of the main reasons cabin boy comes up short is that it is so obviously a chris elliott vanity project . the four fishermen are virtually interchangeable characters ; not one of them is given a distinct comic personality out of which some humor could arise . there is a glimpse of what could have been in the character of the impossibly dense first cabin boy , who has a few brief scenes worth a chuckle or two , but he soon disappears . almost every punch line is elliott's , and a little of him can go a very long way . his comic vision is certainly unique , and viewers perfectly attuned to a mind that concocts a giant talking cupcake that spits tobacco might have much more fun with cabin boy than i had . however , i suspect a larger percentage will find it slow going , and exceedingly short on solid laughs . like caviar , chris elliott is an acquired taste . also like caviar , he should probably only be digested in very small portions . cabin boy was just too much for me to swallow .

1094,"starring : richard gere , sharon stone , lolita davidovich . screenplay : david rayfiel & marshall brickman . director : mark rydell . exactly when it happened , i can't put my finger on . for about half an hour of intersection , i was intrigued , and wondered whether i was on to my first guilty pleasure of 1994 . then , at some point , i began to realize that intersection was taking itself far too seriously . while the film is cleverly structured and reasonably well-acted , it began to irritate me that it was trying to turn a mid-life crisis into a great existential drama . worse yet , it presented me with a "" hero "" i couldn't stand and an ending that left me angry . as i noted , intersection's early scenes boast enough slickness and craft to lend the illusion of consequence . the lead performances by gere , stone and davidovich are all understated , and davidovich in particular generates quite a bit of audience sympathy . efficient editing by mark warner and glossy photography by the talented vilmos zsigmond create a dreamy atmosphere , and james newton howard's jazzy score plays up the romance angle . the dialogue in the script by david rayfiel and marshall brickman is snappy , keeping conversations lively enough to maintain interest . it isn't all that long , however , before it becomes evident that there isn't all that much going on beneath intersection's shiny surface . the performers are "" understated "" primarily because there is so little substance to any of the characters . olivia is perky and sweet , but it's never particularly clear why she's so into vincent . sally , in the flashback sequences , is made to appear icy and reserved , and one of those scenes is quite clever . still , nothing in her character seems to justify vincent's behavior , and this may be intersection's critical failing . if it seems like i was expecting a morality tale . . . well , by the time it was over , i was . but even those who allow vincent more leeway than i did are likely to be turned off by mark rydell's heavy handed direction . gere's angst ridden face is frequently in close-up , usually while driving ; he probably ends up playing as many scenes with a steering wheel as he does with another actor . an antique clock becomes a distracting symbol , and the omnipresent northwest rain an objective correlative i could have done without . frequent flashbacks and dream sequences make for a dizzying narrative . so many stylistic choices in intersection turned me off that i'm tempted not to mention the off-handed allusion to the fact that vincent's 13-year-old daughter has an eating disorder . eh , why nitpick ? name it and it probably turned me off .

"" "" can you believe this ? "" he seems to be saying . "" it's not just a game any more !

1098,"screenplay : david zucker , pat proft and robert locash . i'd like to say a word at this time about the proliferation of genre parody/spoofs in the last year : stop . in twelve months we've seen at least half a dozen such films ( loaded weapon 1 , fatal instinct , robin hood : men in tights , etc . ) , with roughly that many laughs between them . last year's hot shots ! part deux was a tolerable but limp effort ; still , it shines next to naked gun 33-1/3 . the third installment in the series is only sporadically amusing , and often crosses the pop culture cannibalism scale from parody into self-parody . the first ten minutes of naked gun 33-1/3 offers some promise . the opening sequence targets the train station steps sequence from the untouchables , and it features some solid belly laughs thanks to a careful setup . there are also a couple of winning moments in the traditional opening credits featuring a roof's-eye view from a moving police car , particularly a nod to the death star trench run from star wars . unfortunately , that's where naked gun 33-1/3 hits the runout groove . in a zaz film , whether or not it works ultimately comes down to how many of the gags work , and there are painfully few good gags here . part of the problem can be attributed to director peter segal . much of the enjoyment from earlier zaz efforts came from watching the backgrounds , picking up jokes on the fringes of the frame . you fill in the gag ) . while none of their films were afraid to go for groaners , the difference is that they didn't underline them . many of the films naked gun 33-1/3 chooses to parody seem ripe for the picking , but the execution stumbles . jane's departure with friend louise in a green oldsmobile convertible seems to offer a great deal of promise , but the expected thelma & lousie parody offers surprising little payoff . time after time it looks like something worthwhile is coming along , and time after time the jokes just fall flat . there is one other crucial factor worth noting in naked gun 33-1/3 , and that is the performance of leslie nielsen . similarly , fred ward brings none of the qualities ricardo montalban and robert goulet brought to the first two films . rather than playing against the laughs , all the performers seem to be playing with them , and much of the goofiness is lost . it's too bad . i was hoping we could avoid naked gun . 44 : magnum farce .

1099,"screenplay : darryl quarles and don rhymer . director : raja gosnell . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 99 minutes . the plot of big momma's house is martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress . that's not just the high-concept premise ; it's the fully-realized , all-encompassing plot . such an emphasis is not unheard-of in the world of hollywood summer entertainment . one need merely look back to last summer , when the plot of big daddy was adam sandler being an incompetent surrogate parent . the trap inherent in such an approach is that the high-concept plot idea better be pretty well-realized , or rest on the shoulders of an extremely talented performer , because you can bet there will be nothing else worth a second of your time -- not a developed character , not a provocative theme , not a witty twist . you will get 90-plus minutes of martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress -- nothing more , nothing less . those who find martin lawrence more than an occasionally amusing screen presence may have a shot at enjoying the one-note dud that is big momma's house . others will simply stare , mouth agape , at its sheer unapologetic laziness . that leaves master of disguise malcolm to go under very heavy cover as big momma and find out what sherry knows . big momma's house's bloodlines are certainly traceable to mrs . doubtfire -- director raja gosnell edited that film , and the makeup effects were similarly created by greg cannom -- but there's just as strong a whiff of tootsie in the main character's attempt to use his alternate identity to get closer to a woman . unfortunately , big momma's house makes a ridiculous decision neither of those other films made : instead of having the protagonist pose as a completely manufactured character unfamiliar to anyone elses , it places malcolm in the position of playing a friend and family member to several other characters . suspension of disbelief in big momma's house requires you to believe every other person in the film is blind and/or stupid , since no one notices that one big momma looks or sounds absolutely nothing like the other . of course , laughs trumps logic every time , and big momma's house probably still would have worked in spite of its utter disdain for common sense if it had just managed to be funny . martin lawrence can be likeable enough at times , but there's no reason to care a whit about his budding romance with sherry because malcolm is never an independently significant character . he's just big momma without the makeup on . i won't waste time commenting on how ineptly the set-up of the escaped convict is employed , since it was clearly a waste of time to the film-makers . there are a few token scenes of lester looming as a threatening figure , but he's ultimately a distraction in a film that's really about its central visual incongruity ( and the accompanying lascivious glances at nia long's posterior ) . i'm never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people -- several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing -- but i know that when a film-maker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that it's an entire film , i duck out of the way . the gross implausibility of big momma's house might have been tolerable if it was seasoned with more big , cleverly-constructed laughs . its lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant . big momma's house is ridiculous _and_ not funny . it's just a sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1100,"screenplay/director : bille august . and that just about covers most of what is wrong with this adaptation of isabel allende's novel . there are plenty of other things wrong--inappropriate tone , dreadful miscasting , laughable acting--but the fundamental failing of the house of the spirits is a screenplay which races from scenario to scenario without any apparent concern for the establishment of character . when this two hour-plus "" epic "" concluded , i felt nothing for the characters and embarrassment for the cast . it is difficult to comprehend how bille august thought he could accomplish everything it seems he wanted to accomplish in only 140 minutes . in fact , after only twenty minutes i could tell that the house of the spirits should have been a miniseries , and should have been directed by someone else . there is no texture , no depth and no life to any of these characters ; august directs as though he is interested only in getting in , doing a scene , and getting out . but close has just a few minutes of screen time before this scene , giving ferula no chance to develop that history . everything is too densely compressed and without resonance , and the house of the spirits blasts through six decades without leaving any emotion in its wake . with such a basic flaw at the core of the film , all other criticism seems like nit-picking . however , it is difficult not to note that the house of the spirits could have been much better with a cast that seemed at all comfortable in these roles . the primary culprit is jeremy irons , whose performance here is , quite simply , appalling . esteban is the pivotal character in this story , but irons gives no subtlety to his systematic alienation of his family . in his defense , he does have to deliver his lines through an obviously annoying set of false teeth , but he still mugs his way shamelessly through scenes which required an understanding of traditional latino conceptions of masculinity which he clearly did not have . winona ryder continues to act out of her depth , although she has some good scenes in the final half hour when the political drama takes center stage . close has a thankless , twitchy role , and streep merely looks radiant without having any real presence . only banderas and joaquin martinez , as esteban's bastard son , show any spark . how curious . . . that two hispanic actors should seem to grasp this material . it sort of makes you wonder what might have been . miramax must have looked at the pedigree on this film and thought it had a purebred winner on its hands . i hope someday someone films the house of the spirits as a miniseries . the material deserves a second chance .

1101,"there's something terribly depressing about a wonderful concept turned into mush by someone who doesn't know how to handle it . the irritations of a film like the replacements are far more mundane by comparison-you know that it will be at best a tolerable audience-friendly mediocrity , at worst a bland , pressed and processed entertainment mcnugget . but i'm a cheerleader , on the other hand , could have been a brilliant bit of satire . it could have been the kind of film that , even while preaching to the choir , highlights the magnificent absurdities of a very hot-button issue . could've been , but isn't . there's something in that idea to anger virtually anyone , only babbit doesn't pursue it . even the good gags babbit wrings from this variation -- like the photo in megan's school locker -- are underlined too obviously , and never reach into truly daring areas . the campy tone set in the first half-hour , including moriarty's drag diva performance , show that babbit isn't particularly interested in scathing humor . simple mockery suits her just fine . even that tone , however , proves to be one she can't sustain . but i'm a cheerleader might never have been riotously funny as the silly spoof it initially appears to be , but at least it might have felt consistent . babbit makes the ridiculous decision to bounce back and forth between scoring points off swishy stereotypes , exploring the conflicts of family reaction to homosexuality and developing an actual romantic sub-plot . there's not nearly enough substance to but i'm a cheerleader for its serious side to feel anything but token , and too many misguided serious moments to give it a real comic kick . and you can feel that potential being crushed under babbit's leaden heel every time megan and graham share a tender moment . there are plenty of people who take the idea of converting gays and lesbians to heterosexuality very seriously , and plenty of people with same-sex attractions who desperately want such programs to work . babbit never seems to clue into that fact , or she would base her satire more squarely in the growing popularity of these programs . instead , she lays out but i'm a cheerleader as though the whole idea were self-evidently ludicrous , and gets lazy about finding the humor in people scrambling for conformity , acceptance and easy answers to a challenging issue . but i'm a cheerleader simply isn't funny enough often enough , and that's the kiss of death for a low-budget comedy full of broad performances and careless story-telling ( what happened to the foreshadowing involving another girl's apparent jealousy of megan and graham's relationship ? ) . there's no excuse for a subject this incendiary to be the stuff of pratfalls and sappy endings . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"" bronson pinchot's scene-stealing serge from cop i returns as a personal security-device peddler in a scene which takes far too long to introduce a single plot element . ditto for the scene in which we sit through an entire park attraction , because we know it's going to show up later . there is no economy to the screenwriting or the direction , and landis has simply gotten too predictable in his shot selection . in one scene in a restaurant bar , i anticipated the conclusion of the scene two minutes before it happened . it's also extremely unfortunate that in addition to abandoning the cop i formula , de souza has also decided to abandon the characters . perhaps to set up an action sequence . murphy gets to fire a lot of bullets , but gets painfully few opportunities to show that axel's greatest weapon is his wits . of course , it would have been difficult for any wit to come through when murphy sleepwalks through his performance . perhaps he senses what the audience does , that a thirty-something axel foley isn't nearly as interesting as a twenty-something axel foley . there is some good action to be found in beverly hills cop iii , particularly a rescue on a runaway park ride , and one very funny sequence involving a multi-faceted gun . but there is none of the irreverent edge that made the young murphy so appealing . maybe that's what depressed me most about cop iii : considering the possibility that we might never see that eddie murphy again .

"" i've given you the movie , "" he seems to be saying ; "" you fill in the motivation . "" and so it goes in a script that's like a chinese combination platter : one from column a , one from column b . only without any of the flavor . that goes for a meticulously integrated collection of double d's , craftily acted to a one but established from their sledge-hammer opening confessionals in the broadest possible terms . the sweathogs were given more depth . with his ewok hugability , devito can't pull off the hard-edged rago of the film's early scenes . nuances of character aside , renaissance man is simply an unfunny , earthbound comedy . there are at least three too many double d's , each requiring a personal epiphany of varying magnitude , and penny marshall has to spread the film far too thin to accomodate them . there is no spark , no energy , no anything to renaissance man's laboriously staged set pieces but musical crying cues . marshall's old-fashioned brand of sentimentality doesn't play without characters the audience cares about , and renaissance man chugs to its conclusion without an ounce of genuine humanity . renaissance man is the kind of film that wears its emotion in such lines as "" victory starts here "" ( accompanied by an emphatic gesture to the head ) , and exchanges between rago and his daughter like : "" do you want your pennant ? "" "" no , i just want you to believe in me .

"" however , one wonders whether anyone involved in it could happen to you ever saw a frank capra film . the capra heroes played by james stewart , gary cooper and others were not spotless , just basically good folks struggling to do the right thing . i almost wondered whether the nice guy character was being mocked . bridget fonda is nearly as angelic , though she is given a tough background to overcome and an endearing fatalism . fonda and cage are two likable actors , but ultimately there is not a drop of tension in their relationship . that's a real disappointment , because i expect better from andrew bergman . he has written or co-written some of the funniest and quirkiest screenplays of the last twenty years , including blazing saddles , the in-laws and the freshman , and directed last year's enjoyable honeymoon in vegas . both of them should know better . comedy requires some kind of edge to get it rolling , whether it's situation or character , and it could happen to you has neither . at its best , it produces a few smiles . at its worst , rosie perez is on screen . as the "" villain "" of the film , perez plays muriel as an unrepentant shrew-from-hell , and it's the kind of part where she's in the most trouble . her voice , somewhat grating in its most tolerable moments , skyrockets into dog whistle range when she browbeats cage . it is a performance so annoying that even had it could happen to you been satisfying on all other counts , she might have spoiled the experience singlehandedly . there's nothing wrong with fairy tale love stories ; beauty and the beast was one of the most romantic film experiences of the decade so far . but those animated characters were more real than anyone in it could happen to you .

1110,"screenplay : david veloz , richard rutowski and oliver stone . director : oliver stone . few filmmakers in the last twenty years have so consistently had so little to say as loudly as oliver stone . by pairing up his single-note self-righteousness with cinematic histrionics , stone has managed to create a controversial body of work which dazzles with its visual inventiveness even as it clubs you insensible with its strident moralizing . natural born killers is the natural culmination of this style/message schism , a gutsy and gaudy assault on the senses that forgets to bring along a single original or insightful thought . even the dynamic performances of woody harrelson and juliette lewis can't salvage this busy mess . the first hour of natural born killers is made watchable only by the intensity of the two stars . woody harrelson stretches himself as never before , his simpleton charm connecting to a genuine amorality , while juliette lewis takes her wounded white-trash act from kalifornia and runs with it , exploding at arbitrary moments into astonishing ferocity . but for all their sound and fury , mickey and mallory aren't really characters . they're ciphers , stick-figure representations of a societal ill , and ciphers just aren't all that interesting . the technical flotsam and jetsam surrounding them can't disguise that fact , and only the positively inspired segment casting mallory's home life as a twisted 1950s sitcom goes anywhere beneath the surface . as it nears its mid-point , mickey and mallory's road show becomes extremely tedious . as over-the-top as they are , they seem at least remotely grounded in humanity , unlike our surreal chauffeurs through the netherworld . "" look at what the media has done to us , "" he says with genuine shock and , of course , superiority . the problem is that it's the same idea that drove man bites dog . and kalifornia . and every one of those films told the same story better , without pumping steroids into the production . there is no satire to the excesses of natural born killers , because oliver stone has no idea how to achieve that level of subtlety . if natural born killers had been made by any other director , i might have given it grudging support simply for having the courage to run to the limit in its audacious originality . unfortunately , i have lost all patience with stone's pedantry-as-art approach to filmmaking . compare the first hour of natural born killers with david lynch's wild at heart , which leavened its shock value with a warped sense of humor and simmering menace , and you'll see that what stone attempted to accomplish could have been done right . you just want it to stop .

1111,"director : mel smith . a couple of years ago , director barry levinson made a movie based on a twenty-year-old idea . this pet project was loud , heavy-handed and self-indulgent , and clearly showed why it hadn't been made twenty years earlier : it wasn't a very good idea . however , levinson had acquired the cachet to make any movie he wanted to make , so he made toys . george lucas has even more cachet , and he also decided to produce a twenty-year-old idea . radioland murders is an attempt at farce that is simply chaotic and grating , and its frantic pace can't disguise the fact that it just isn't funny . however , there is a lot more going on backstage than onstage . for nearly its entire first hour , radioland murders succeeded primarily in giving me a terrible headache . the story rockets from character to character , lingering just long enough to let us see that each one is defined almost exclusively by a single annoying character trait . subtle nuance in characterization may be too much to expect from a broad comedy like radioland murders , but it's still a problem when virtually the entire cast is so irritatingly one-note that you begin hoping various characters will be the next to die . they are also stuck with dialogue that must have had whiskers on it in 1939 , like the ever-uproarious "" you may think you know what i know , but i don't think you know what you think you know "" bit . the slapstick is better , but it too is simply too stale to sustain the energy . every time he does so , radioland murders just stops dead , and it's not worth the jerky ride simply to see cameos by billy barty , rosemary clooney and george burns . ultimately , that decision is indicative of what is most wrong with radioland murders : no one seems clear exactly what it is supposed to be . a backstage farce a la noises off ? a romantic comedy ? lucas and his team of screenwriters seem to want it all , and as a result they end up without much of anything . radioland murders is one of those unfortunate films which equates loud and fast with entertaining , when in reality it's simply noisy and busy .

1112,"while he worked on other projects , he would shoot pieces of don quixote here and there , in the hope that some day he would have the financing necessary to complete the project . they have done welles' memory a tremendous disservice in the process . don quixote is a monumental disappointment , with only glimpses of welles' brilliance emerging from an exercise in editing butchery . this collision of eras is the heart of welles' vision for don quixote , and to the extent that it survives the film is thought- provoking . and we see that this is what has occurred ; welles skillfully frames shots that include a billboard for "" don quixote cerveza "" and the restaurante don qixote , emphasizing the character's nature as an icon . unfortunately , don quixote takes nearly an hour to get to its contemporary setting , and that hour occasionally borders on the unwatchable . it is not simply that the quality of the print is sometimes horrible . there is simply no rhythm to the story , and it feels for all the world like pieces of film stuck together at random . as striking as some of welles' images are , editing director jess franco simply had no idea what to do with them , and apparently even changed some of the editing welles * had * managed to complete before his death . another huge problem with the film involves the dialogue dubbing . although two other actors portray don quixote and sancho panza , their parts were filmed silent , with welles himself to dub both voices . however , only portions of welles' dialogue were recorded , and where his dialogue doesn't exist , two other actors were used to provide the voices . not only is the shift between welles' voice and that of two other men jarring , but the two other actors do not even come close to the spirit of the vocal performances welles was providing . don quixote and sancho panza are not even the same characters from one scene to the next , and at times the appalling modern voiceovers are simply laughable . the version of don quixote which screened at san jose's cinequest film festival is not the same as the one which made its american premiere at the museum of modern art . oja kodar , welles' companion during the last years of his life , and frequent welles cinematographer gary graber trimmed a 113-minute version to just under 90 minutes , and it would be an easy knock at the film to say that any changes which made it shorter still would be a further improvement . but there's really no way of knowing , and that's the real point . using guesswork and very little talent , a bunch of well-intentioned film buffs tried to piece together a lot of raw footage into something resembling the work of one of the greatest filmmakers of all time .

1113,"screenplay/director : luc besson . i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick . it boasts extremely glossy cinematography , a couple of recognizable name actors , and a couple of fairly impressive explosions . it's also basically about violence and cheap titilation , and features a central relationship between a middle-aged man and a twelve-year-old girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension . the professional is all over the map , and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant . writer/director luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita , a slick potboiler about a female assassin . there is no question that besson can make a great * looking * film ; with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast , he has created a film chock full of moody close-ups and evocative lighting . but beneath the shiny wrapper , there isn't nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe . the relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop . leon is mostly a collection of quirky traits , all intended to show us that for a hired killer , he's really not so bad a guy : he drinks lots of milk , takes meticulous care of a potted plant , and enjoys gene kelly movies . jean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted and desperate quality , but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda . natalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality , but she doesn't have too much to work with , either . besson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life , and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing . a silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place , as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover ; character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag . gary oldman's entire part is something of a cheap gag , wild-eyed and way over the top , but at least he is interesting to watch . there isn't a real person to be found anywhere in the professional , which isn't always a problem in an action thriller , except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more . a more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of a twelve-year-old in a really distasteful way . this is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9mm pistol , or the blood which is spilled aplenty . a great deal of the time , the professional is just plain sleazy , and all the soft filters in the world can't disguise that fact . "
1114,"while watching drop zone , i kept thinking about those ski films warren miller has been making for years . you know the ones--they're basically a bunch of impressive stunts and nice photography . well , drop zone looks like a skydiving version of one of those films , to which someone has attempted to add a plot . i emphasize the word "" attempted , "" and it's an extremely lackluster attempt at that . there is some great aerial footage in drop zone , but the story is a complete bore , and wesley snipes continues to bury himself in z-grade action films . we've already had one skydiving movie this year ( terminal velocity ) , and it wasn't a particularly good one . however , terminal velocity did have one very important thing going for it--no one involved seemed to be taking themselves at all seriously . it was light-hearted , and occasionally quite funny . drop zone , on the other hand , is best taken with meals as a mild sedative . it's not stretching the point to say that the plot between skydiving sequences in drop zone is somewhere on the order of the plot between sex scenes in your standard x-rated film . of course , as with that example , most viewers probably aren't coming to drop zone for riveting plot turns and crackling dialogue . the skydiving sequences are fantastic , perhaps the best i've ever seen . they are creatively shot , and include some impressive synchronized stunts . as long as drop zone is in the air , it is something quite exciting . then it hits ground again , and it burns in hard . after beginning as a rip-off of passenger 57 , drop zone ends like a rip-off of die hard , and a really bad one at that . gary busey delivers a performance that has stamps on it , practically sighing audibly as he wanders through a half-hearted version of his under siege psycho act . it is inexcusable in an action thriller to have a boring villain , and busey has not an ounce of charisma in this role . director john badham has made exciting films in the past , but even he appears to be slumming here . while the action in the air ( which was not his to shoot ) is great , the action on the ground is often ineptly staged and badly edited . what is genuinely depressing is watching the direction wesley snipes' career is taking . snipes is a fine actor with a tremendous range , but for a few years now he has appeared almost exclusively in bad action films . but snipes should really think about taking a few character parts that force producers to take him seriously as an actor , and for him to have a chance at the kind of roles samuel l . jackson and laurence fishburne are given a shot at . his performance in drop zone is thoroughly competent , but that's all it has to be . if he contines to appear in films like drop zone , he might as well take his career and jump out of a plane with it . without a parachute .

1115,"screenplay : peter farrelly , bennett yulin and bobby farrelly . director : peter farrelly . 1994 at the movies had many stories , but none may be as unlikely as the emergence of jim carrey as one of the biggest box office draws in the country . i enjoyed both films on their own merits because they were made by directors who had the good sense to get out of the way and let carrey do what he does best : be a walking cartoon . dumb and dumber is the kind of movie for which "" sophomoric "" would be a compliment , but it could have worked with carrey's unique gifts at center stage . instead , it's just plain stupid , and about as badly put together a movie as i saw all year . we've all seen comedies where every funny moment was already in the previews , but dumb and dumber falls into an entirely new category . not only is the preview funnier than the movie , but it contains different takes of the same scene than ended up in the final product , and in every case the take that was used in the preview was funnier . it looks like director peter farrelly turned all his raw footage over to a trailer production company , then promptly proved that he should have given them the final cut on his movie . farrelly , quite simply put , does not appear to have the slightest clue about comic timing . jim carrey knows plenty about comic timing , but he is really adrift here , particularly in the first hour . i have this feeling that somewhere on a cutting room floor is a very funny performance , but it's not on the screen in dumb and dumber . there are a few moments when carrey gets to show off his talents , particularly an extended fantasy sequence which includes an exaggerated kung fu battle in a restaurant , but director farrelly ( working from a script co-written with brother bobby and bennett yellin ) appears determined not to let dumb and dumber become a jim carrey showcase . and while daniels is a solid if unspectacular dramatic actor , he is way out of is element here . you've got to respect him for trying a part so far from his image , but only for brief flashes is he a convincing moron . once the twosome gets to aspen , there are more laughs by far . the spectacle of carrey and daniels in gloriously hideous tuxedos , bright orange and powder blue respectively , is enough to prompt a laugh , and a hilariously gross scene finds daniels suffering the effects of a massive dose of laxative . but for the majority of its running time , dumb and dumber cranks out gags so predictable i was minutes ahead of the punch lines . to be fair , i don't think i'm in the target audience for dumb and dumber ; the fifty or so middle-schoolers at my showing laughed loud and often .

1116,"screenplay : jeb stuart & peter stone . director : arne glimcher . and what is astonishing about all three of these examples is that for the longest time , few people really thought of any of them as good actors . he is an impressive presence in just cause , but he is wasted . just cause is a sorry excuse for a thriller , with both narrative and character handled with remarkable ineptitude . the cast of just cause is loaded with talent , and that alone offered a great deal of promise . kate capshaw takes a step up from her blink-and-you'll-miss-it role in love affair , but she isn't really subtle enough an actor to make the stock threatened wife role anything interesting . blair underwood has a few nice moments early , but he too is saddled with a shallow character with some really unpleasant undertones . then there is connery , who can do wonders with a wry smile but is trapped in a character that looks like it was abandoned by writers jeb stuart and peter stone two-thirds of the way through and completed by computer . there is some suggestion early in the film that there is a reason armstrong hasn't practiced law in 25 years , a reason which will play a role in ferguson's case . again there is the suggestion that there is a dark , guilty secret in armstrong's past , but there is never another mention of the issue . actually , describing the plot as "" developing "" is something of an overstatement . just cause is a completely predictable thriller , with deus ex machina clues popping up for armstrong to discover and a plot twist which was nearly inevitable . director arne glimcher doesn't appear to have a single original idea for how to construct a film like this , so he puts together ideas from a hundred other mundane thrillers : a car chase here , a woman in distress there , a serial killer , a mano-a-mano in the everglades and some moody lighting . but there's just no point to any of it . just cause fails to generate an ounce of tension because tension depends on unpredictability and characters we genuinely want to see survive the danger . i was actually kind of hoping that everyone would end up as gator bait . "
1117,"screenplay : andrew kevin walker and neal jimenez director : brett leonard . thriller-cum-horror films tend to come in two basic flavors . on one end you've got your high-school audience slasher film , one of those infinitely sequeled flicks based on a charismatic killer named freddy or chuckie or pinhead ; on the other end is your moody , upscale thriller , something that genuinely tries to be creepy and doesn't depend entirely on bursts of music or a cat leaping out at someone . there are about ten times as many of the former as the latter , and as a result i limit the films in the genre that i choose to see to those i have some moderate hope for . hideaway could have been one of the rare quality efforts , but instead of being ambitious , it's mostly just pretentious and gimmicky , and pretty dull besides . naturally , there are a few side effects : headaches , trouble sleeping and an unsettling tendency to see visions of murders . based on the novel by dean koontz , hideaway has some fairly promising psychological material at its core . these issues could have been utilized to make hideaway something more than standard issue supernatural horror fare , but director brett leonard refuses to let character matter . while not nearly as techno-happy as he was in his previous film the lawnmower man , leonard still makes hideaway too much about filtered shots ( used to simulate hatch's visions ) and some absurd computer- generated visions of the afterlife . at least the computer tricks are moderately interesting to look at . hideaway is mostly a big fat bore , full of performances which could politely be called somnabulistic . it often appears as though in between takes he was watching his own performance in the fly and wondering , "" how did i do that ? "" it is jeremy sisto who really deserves our pity , though . his teen psycho could have been fascinating and even sympathetic , but he is turned into a tiresome heavy-metal-listenin' , sunglasses-at-night-wearin' , virgin-sacrificin' , black-candle-lightin' , devil-worshippin' plot device . hideaway completely implodes with a preposterous climax which reduces the eternal battle between good and evil to a cool psychedelic light show , with a life-affirming vision from beyond thrown in for good measure . it is , however , merely the logical culmination of an incompetent directing job which can't even seem to do cliches right . hideaway is a good idea for a thriller ; if only it had been scary . or different . or * something * . "
1118,"a movie about divorce and custody in 1995 seems about as timely as a movie about mood rings . family breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american landscape for nearly thirty years , and countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious court battles in hand-wringing detail . still , i can't recall a comedy about the subject before bye bye love . and after it , i still can't . bye bye love is rarely funny , more often a weak and melodramatic retread of common tv-movie fare . only a few moments which have nothing to do with the film's main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion . the three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo , and the quality of their performances is of widely varying quality . randy quaid is the best of the three , bitter without being irritating , gleefully spiteful without being frightening . he does get bye bye love's best sub-plot , a hilarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo , and he does a great slow burn . paul reiser really has only one character , his slightly befuddled , uptight nice guy "" mad about you "" persona , but he does it well . as a personality , he is appealing , but as a character , he becomes pretty boring here . matthew modine , is , quite simply , terrible . this isn't a performance good enough to be called mailed-in ; he even forgot to put a stamp on it . modine lacks any charm in an appallingly under-written role , looks bored most of the time , and gets stuck with a trite little speech about how it's all his father's fault he's such a cad . bye bye love basically comes off as a very confused movie , because it spends far too much of its time on the new relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers and their kids , making it just another "" dating in the 90s "" movie . when the movie does deal with the children at all , it is to have one of them scream out an accusation and/or cry , perhaps to be resolved later by a sensitive talk and a hug , perhaps not . it is a sad end to flanders' career , getting caught up in a truly annoying over-use of mcdonald's as a location , a plot device and , apparently , a major advertiser . even if bye bye love had decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on the parent-child relationships , it still would have been pretty difficult to pull off , because ultimately there is very little humor one can wring from family break-ups and their effects on children . any way you slice it , it is a bad situation for kids , and the makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings when dealing with the single parenting issue . it is left to the dads' romantic fumblings to probide what little humor there is , and it isn't enough . there have been comparisons between bye bye love and parenthood , but parenthood was both genuinely funny and genuinely touching . bye bye love is a genuine shame .

1119,"screenplay : ruth prawer jhabvala . director : james ivory . if ismail merchant and james ivory are not careful , their names might very well lose their proper noun status . like q-tip or xerox , "" merchant ivory "" is becoming something of a generic term , a descriptor for intimate period pieces in the tradition of critical successes like a room with a view , howards end and the remains of the day . for many moviegoers , though , the term is also used to evoke images of technically proficient but turgid filmmaking . sadly , jefferson in paris is everything their most vocal detractors have accused merchant ivory efforts of being . there are plenty of beautiful sets , meaningful glances and profound discussions , but there isn't a shred of compelling drama to connect them , or a single key character into whose life we are given any insight . this is not a biographical sketch with a point of view . it's a series of anecdotes , many of them apocryphal . or a lengthy scene at an opera in which the relationship between jefferson and maria cosway is not furthered one bit ? writer ruth prawer jhabvala is a genius at adapting the narratives of other writers for the screen , but she does a terrible job of constructing a narrative from a collection of historical footnotes . this is simply everything you always wanted to know about thomas jefferson but were afraid to ask . it is an awful performance of a character with tremendous potential , and the script never even bothers to try to get inside his head . i felt i had a better understanding of jefferson from staring at mount rushmore . ivory does deliver some finely crafted scenes , of course , such as louis xvi learning about the revolution while on a hunt , and richard robbins' score and tony pierce-roberts' cinematography are characteristically superb . it isn't about the scandalous , if historically questionable , notion that jefferson fathered children by one of his slaves . it isn't really * about * anything . like the worst high school history textbooks , it just starts in one place and ends in another , and all you really want to do is look at the pictures .

1120,"the recipe for the phantom is the result of the kind of perverse logic which produces some of hollywood's most spectacular flops . there is a super-hero in a form-fitting costume , because the people seemed to love it in superman and batman ; there is derring-do in the 1930s involving mysterious and powerful relics , because the people seemed to love it in the indiana jones films ; there is a nasty industrialist and a feisty heroine because , well , the people always seem to love that . in short , the phantom is an action-adventure frankenstein's monster , cobbled together from pieces of other much better films -- and then nobody remembered to give it a jolt of energy . if the phantom resembles any other recent attempt at cinematic super-heroism , it is 1994's bomb the shadow . it is a film which never once carves out for itself a distinct theme -- too straight most of the time to be camp , and too dumb to work as a rousing adventure . wincer likes to let his stories unfold at a leisurely pace , but there isn't much of a story to unfold in the phantom . that leaves him with action set pieces which are slow , perfunctory , and lacking a unique flavor . the phantom feels like the work of a director who simply never had an idea about what to do with the material . to be fair to wincer , that appears to be true of the cast as well . similarly , megalomania has never seemed as charming and unthreatening as it does coming from treat williams , in one of the least interesting villain performances in recent memory . when cary-hiroyuki tagawa turns up as pirate lord kabai sengh nearly 90 minutes into the phantom , i found myself utterly stumped as to why he wasn't the primary bad guy , since at least he had charisma . and pity poor kristy swanson , trying so hard to be a spunky liberated woman that she never bothers to notice that she doesn't have a character to play . rarely have i seen a so-called adventure film in which so many participants seemed to be going through the motions like basketball players on the wrong side of a blow-out , wrestling with a thoroughly synthetic script . jeffrey boam ( indiana jones and the last crusade , lethal weapon 2 & 3 ) knows how to work with established characters in an established formula , and that's the way he approaches the phantom : as though we already know the drill , he's just filling in the blanks , and the phantom character's status as antecedent to modern action films shields it from charges of wholesale theft . but it simply isn't the case that his audience is essentially familiar with the phantom . "
1121,"screenplay : michael crichton , anne-marie martin . director : jan debont . the makers of big-budget summer movies and those who attend those movies appear to have come to an understanding , an understanding best exemplified by an observation i made while watching twister . several times during the film , there would come a point where it would become clear that the latest sequence showcasing industrial light & magic's computer-generated tornados was at an end ( it usually coincided with the dialogue once again becoming audible ) , at which point several members of the audience would stand up and quickly make their way towards the restroom . they were probably rather secure in the knowledge that they would not miss any crucial plot twists or juicy bits of character development during these brief expository interludes , and even if they did , they were not missing what they had come to the film to see . not a penny of the money they had plunked down would be wasted if they missed a couple of the characters engaged in conversation . it is this complicity which produces monotonous displays of technological prowess like twister , a film with a script that makes jurassic park's look positively labyrinthine by comparison . i suppose you have to give the creators of twister credit for coming up with a premise which involves people trying their damnedest to get close to tornados rather than trying their damnedest to get very far away ; it could have been even more tedious . the problem is that it doesn't take long before twister starts to look like a loop film . there are only so many ways you can film a bunch of vehicles driving through fields , over dirt roads , along highways before it becomes a chore to watch , and while director jan debont uses every swooping trick at his disposal , there is an awful lot of nothing going on during twister an awful lot of the time . there may be more driving in twister than there was in debont's debut feature speed . hunt is probably a better actor than bullock , and certainly provides the requisite cuteness factor , but bullock's heroine was able to comment on speed's improbability throughout the film with her priceless reactions . the trite love/hate relationship with which hunt is saddled is something no one could tunnel out from under , and neither she nor paxton has the big screen charisma to make the scenes without inclement weather anything but a monumental bore . every single character manages the astonishing non-euclidean feat of being less than one-dimensional , with characterization coming in such subtle forms as the fleet of identical black mini-vans used by elwes' corporate scientists ( as though you actually needed to see the three 6's behind his ear ) or the van halen tunes blasted by one of hunt's more annoyingly quirky cohorts ( philip seymour hoffman ) . films like twister are often defended with comparisons to amusement park rides -- that they make up in thrills what they lack in drama . i don't think twister even qualifies as a roller-coaster . yes , the visual effects are impressive , but it is impossible to watch them with anything but detachment , because as much as debont tries , he can't imbue a natural phenomenon with a personality ( he actually tries harder than he does with his actors ) . twister is a surprisingly gloomy and inert experience , with exactly two flashes of inspiration through its two hour running time . when they come , they only serve to remind you what the rest of the film is lacking : any sense of the fun that summer movies are supposed to provide . whatever one might think of the increasing mindlessness of effects-driven blockbusters , you'd think they could at least manage to entertain , or to give you a reason to come back when you get up to go to the restroom .

1122,"screenplay : j . f . lawton , michael bortman . director : andrew davis . most of the time , it is fairly easy for me to put my finger on why a film didn't work for me : sloppy performances , inane writing , lackluster production , leaden direction , what have you . there is nothing aggressively unwatchable about this new action thriller , no glaring stupidity ; even keanu reeves didn't make me want to run screaming for the parking lot . yet i left the theater not just unimpressed , but unsatisfied , as though i had just left a restaurant without getting a bite to eat . chain reaction may be one of the most generic film experiences i have ever had , a chain of events without a single speck of personality . it would be easy enough to pick on chain reaction for its obviousness -- if you aren't aware that the government and oil companies would conspire to bury alternative fuel sources , you clearly haven't been doing your street-corner-leaflet reading -- but obviousness tends not to be terribly troublesome to most genre film viewers . no , the real problem is that chain reaction traffics in a kind of monotonous obviousness . those chases are fairly flat , however , and even paranoia becomes mundane in chain reaction . i suppose you can't blame davis for returning to familiar territory after the dismal steal big , steal little , but the familiar in this case has left him wholly uninspired . i think there is also a rather important lesson which davis failed to take away from the fugitive , namely that for a plot of that kind to work , it is fairly important for the hero to be someone you want to root for . harrison ford's richard kimble may not have had a complex history , but at least you knew he had a history . eddie and lily aren't even stock characters in the service of this plot . . . they're one of the reasons chain reaction feels so dead is that every person in the film might as well _be_ dead , even the ordinarily ultra-sinister brian cox as a nasty cia operative . i will give chain reaction credit for casting keanu reeves in a role where he can do little damage . eddie probably has two dozen lines in the whole film , and a quiet keanu is a tolerable keanu . i will also give credit for casting morgan freeman , period . even in a torpid piece of film-making like this , he commands attention , and his speech about the consequences of this new fuel takes on weight just because it is freeman who delivers it . and i will give credit for a welcome refusal to explain the pseudo-science which allows the water-fuel to work . i just wish it could have generated some energy for this film . to borrow the over-worked comparison of action film to amusement park ride , chain reaction is more like the kiddie train at a petting zoo . it just goes around and around and around . . . and then stops .

1123,"screenplay : john carpenter , debra hill , kurt russell . director : john carpenter . let's face it , this isn't exactly indiana jones we're talking about -- kurt russell's snake plissken last graced theater screens fifteen years ago in escape from new york , when a significant percentage of today's action film audience was somewhere between puberty and mastering solid food , and that film was not what one would call a classic of the genre . the result is an attempt at self-satire which comes off as a tiresome exercise in pyrotechnics and cheap blue screen effects . it is a good thing carpenter , russell and company waited so long between new york and l . a . , because even those who actually saw the first film probably have forgotten enough not to notice that escape from l . a . is virtually a point-for-point remake of the original . the number of duplicated details is quite astonishing , actually . the twist they try to place on escape from l . a . is that it is supposed to be funnier , almost a parody of the original . i say "" supposed to "" because john carpenter may be one of the most humorless directors of the last twenty years , taking even bizarre material like big trouble in little china and deadening it with his brooding style . his idea of a joke in escape from l . a . is showing every possible southern california landmark ( hey , it's universal studios ! . . . hey , it's the queen mary ! ) or making a quick reference to every possible stereotype of los angeles living , and to show that he isn't taking anything seriously with some low-tech special effects , including a computer-generated submarine voyage which makes tron look positively state-of-the-art . a few of the gags are clever , like a shot at l . a . 's front-running sports fans ; others can't find a comfortable place between gruesome and silly , like a gang of cosmetic surgery victims always in search of fresh body parts . escape from new york was overly somber , but it was lean and efficient and quite good at creating its desolate urban landscape . there are a few simple pleasures to be found in the performances , including kurt russell's laconic snake . it's one of the best ( if unintentional ) jokes that despite the fact that everyone in the world seems to know who snake plissken is , he has probably been able to escape capture because he has no discernible personality . russell does a guttural clint eastwood impression , and makes a solid anti-hero . snake may be back , but he doesn't have much to say , and what he does have to say has been said before .

"" it's all spectacularly sloppy , but it's hard to know whom to blame . stanley might have wanted to do a cerebral observation on violence and/or religion , but frankenheimer seems to want a good old thriller , and the two angles are not at all complementary . somebody cut this film to ribbons trying to find a point to it all , resulting in a giddy incomprehensibility . exactly what was douglas' role in moreau's experiments supposed to be , anyway ? moreau just keeps staggering forward and swinging wildly , like an overweight boxer without the faintest glimmer of strategy . speaking of overweight . . . oh , but that's far too easy . it would be too simple to observe that when brando makes his first appearance , covered in heavy white makeup and a white muu-muu the size of a circus tent , he looks like nothing so much as the michelin man on safari . it's too simple and somewhat unfair , because even under the burden of all that weight and a ridiculous accent , there is still something compelling about brando on screen . his moreau is what richard attenborough should have been trying to go for as hammond in jurassic park , a pleasant enough chap with a monstrous god complex . val kilmer , who is said to have quite a god complex in real life , seems to have decided to act in a completely different film , one which is much more fun . his montgomery is a casually nasty pot-head , but at least he is entertaining to watch , particularly when he does his dead-on brando impression . and poor david thewlis , whose character has no common sense and no particular reason for being a u . n . peace negotiator ( you'd think that might have been a useful subtext to the war which breaks out on the island ) , tries to look frightened by more than the lack of direction in the film , with little success . but this is a badly fragmented piece of work which manages to achieve tedium in only 96 minutes . perhaps some day they will make a documentary about the making of the film , like they did with apocalypse now in hearts of darkness . then maybe it won't have been a total loss .

"" ah , "" some of you must be musing to yourselves , "" but isn't that scenario he just described remarkably similar to the usual suspects , a film widely praised for its cleverness ? in one extremely significant way : in the rich man's wife , the ending serves absolutely no dramatic purpose . too few critics of the usual suspects gave it credit for making keaton's desire to go legitimate a critical element in the resolution of the story ; the final revelations make him a tragic character , and there is evidence to allow us to reach different conclusions . if the revelation that the story is an complete hoax serves any purpose , it is as an excuse for suspense cliches ( see , that's what they would be _expecting_ ) or for day to turn miraculously to night for added artificial tension . there is a smug pseudo-feminism in amy holden jones' script , a sense that we should be inspired to whoops of "" you go , girls ! "" but jones denies us the chance to under-estimate them because we're never allowed to estimate them in the first place . she isn't playing with expectations or with genre conventions . she's playing us for suckers .

1126,"director : matthew broderick . running time : 119 minutes . here i offer a bit of free , friendly advice for film-makers : if you are going to make a two hour long film , please don't make it feel like a four hour long film . . . and for heaven's sake , don't title it infinity . you just can't feed a critic a straight line like that ; i'm only human , and it's too easy . infinity is a moebius strip of a movie experience , a film which goes on and on and on without a single compelling situation or character to hold your attention . under the rookie direction of matthew broderick , infinity inspires an almost suffocating boredom and the question of why he even bothered to hire an editor . on one level , infinity is a difficult film to hate actively , because it clearly was made with some care . the film is lovingly photographed by toyomichi kurita and scored by bruce broughton , and its period detail is meticulously re-created by production designer bernt capra . that makes infinity a nice film to look at , at least for a little while , until it becomes apparent that there is not a single thing going on worth caring about . the crushing flaw of infinity is that it is almost entirely about the romance between richard and arline , and not once does a spark fly between broderick and arquette . the script ( by broderick's mother patricia ) focuses on the intellectual nature of their relationship without paying much attention to developing them as individuals , resulting in characters constructed mostly of thick queens accents and episodic eccentricity . arquette is more successful at giving arline some small measure of appeal , but she is unable to make this love affair matter . with no other character in the film provided even a glimmer of a personality , infinity rapidly begins to sink under the weight of a painfully dull central relationship . it is not broderick's fault that the real-life circumstances of this story have arline dying for nearly four years , but it is definitely his fault that i was placed in the ghoulish position of hoping she would just get it over with and die already . for nearly ninety minutes arline is alternately sick and well , and over the course of that ninety minutes we move abstractly between richard's personal and professional life , with scene after scene inspiring me to throw up my hands in exasperation at the utter lack of a point . i counted ten scenes in infinity which literally served no narrative or dramatic purpose , and countless other instances where the judicious use of a knife on several hundred frames of film might have made me less eager to use one on my own throat . what it really does , however , is make for a love story without a drop of emotion until broderick breaks down in the film's last scene . at that point , i was sort of feeling like crying myself , mourning two hours of my life which had begun to feel like infinity .

"" with bad readings of bad lines in badly directed scenes , thinner offers little but the opportunity to watch burke's prosthetic transformation from 290 pounds to 130 pounds . doubtfire , the mask ) , and it is impressive work . the "" fat suit "" ( full-body in one shower scene ) is excellent , but it was an even greater challenge to take 50 pounds off , and superb lighting helps cannom achieve that effect . still , all the latex in the world can't turn a cow pie into a chocolate mousse , and stephen king's thinner reeks of incompetence . it is going to be hard for king to distance himself from this one given his cameo as a pharmacist .

"" critics inevitably have longer lists by virtue of more extensive film experience , and i think i have just added another item to mine : beware of films with half a dozen gratuitous cameo appearances . the problem with that particular caveat is that by the time you are in the theater and subjected to the guest star deluge , it is too late . dear god , a miserable excuse for a "" feel-good "" comedy , is a film with no sense of direction whatsoever , causing a barrage of cameos to feel all the more desperate . dear god might have had a chance at being moderately amusing if it had stuck to the formula of a lovable rascal who undergoes a conversion . kinnear's smirking wise-guy persona is perfectly suited to the role of tom , and he can also trot out a chastened charm which ingratiates himself with the audience . the problem is that the car wreck of a script churned out by warren leight and ed kaplan includes so many minor characters and superfluous side plots that dear god becomes thoroughly incoherent . tom is given five sporadically interesting cohorts in the dead letter office where two truly interesting ones would have been a significant improvement , and even though both laurie metcalf and tim conway have nice comic moments , they are playing essentially the same character . things get so bloated that the sub-plot involving tom's loan shark ( john pinette ) vanishes into thin air when he is hit by a bus , as though even director garry marshall realized there was no screen time to spare . for a film overflowing with diversions , dear god is far from overflowing with laughs . since none of the business swirling around the actual plot of dear god is remotely funny , marshall spends most of the film finding places to insert random celebrities . here we have dr . joyce brothers appearing on television ; there we have o . j . simpson prosecutor christopher darden as a court broadcaster . the effect of these cameos is not simply to distract you from what the film is about , but to convince you that they _are_ what the film is about . dear god may begin as a comedy , but it rapidly turns into a bus tour of hollywood where the only response it inspires is pointing and giggling every time a familiar face appears . there are a few amusing bits in the courtroom finale which finds tom on trial for tampering with the mail , notably a goofy piece of acting by metcalf which at least will shake you out of your stupor . you might find yourself wishing it would turn into the re-hash of miracle on 34th street it seems headed for , so that at least it might make _cliched_ sense , only you wouldn't be surprised to find lance ito turning up as the judge , or buddy hackett as kris kringle .

"" even the magnificent , maleficent cruella is not safe from the onslaught of indignities , falling first into a vat of molasses and then into a pile of manure . it is a sign of hughes's love affair with "" america's funniest home videos "" humor that he replaces the original's most memorable suspense sequence -- the puppies' attempt to slip past cruella disguised as black labradors -- and replaces it with a scene in a barn which ends with a pig landing on cruella's chest . glenn close has obvious fun as cruella , playing her as an imperious drag queen , but i'm mystified by raves for her performance . there is no doubt that close can be scary -- she scared a generation of married men into zipping up their pants in fatal attraction -- but there is no malevolence in her characterization of cruella . disney's great villains were real threats , and they didn't take pratfalls ; cruella has horace and jasper so that _they_ can be the comic relief while she spooks the little ones . close cuts a fine figure in cruella's outrageous outfits and commanding some impressive sets , and she is about as intimidating as rupaul . then there are those adorable puppies . there is no point arguing that kids and many adults won't enjoy the frolicking dalmatians , because they will . there are a few marvelously trained animals in 101 dalmatians , and they provide some amusing moments . you could also get the same reaction out of most kids if you sat them down in front of a home movie of puppies playing , or an old episode of "" those amazing animals , "" or even a westminster dog show on espn2 , because reaction to the dogs in 101 dalmatians is not based on any kind of plot requiring individual personality for the animal characters . though the same kind of animatronic critters used in babe are used in 101 dalmatians , the animals don't talk here . not only does that make for some confusing narrative ( one scene found several kids around me perplexed as to why lucky was still in danger ) , but it makes the canine cast of 101 dalmatians little more than a big spotted blur . a certain kind of manipulative drama has long been called a "" tear-jerker , "" and 101 dalmatians is the family film equivalent . it's an "" awww-jeker , "" trotting out the adorable little puppies and having them yap at you until you begin to consider turning them into a coat yourself .

"" while they're still getting to point b , or getting up with the rest of the audience after the big explosion which signals that nothing else of any consequence is going to happen . "
1133,"screenplay : darrell roodt and greg latter . director : darrell james roodt . least nominally . i believe that is part of the point roodt is trying to make -- that post-apartheid south africa has become a dangerous ground of a different kind , much like the american inner cities -- but he has chosen a singularly monotonous and pedantic way of doing it . just beyond the nods to african culture and the wall of homilies you will find a dreary guns-and-drugs picture that feels like the least inspired of a hundred guns-and-drugs pictures you might have seen before . only the accents have been changed to distinguish the guilty . once you acknowledge the sociological curiosity , you are left with a film lacking anything new or interesting to say as a story . it doesn't help matters that ice cube is woefully miscast in the lead role . ice cube has proven that he can act , and he has a powerful screen presence , but the character he is playing is supposed to be a doctoral student in literature who has lost touch with "" the struggle "" while ensconced in the ivory tower . it is also a terribly one-dimensional performance ; it often seems that if he didn't have something to scowl at , there wouldn't be any reason for him to have a face . to be fair to ice cube , i don't think there's much that anyone could have done with such a ridiculous character . if i were asked to deliver lines like "" that's how you fight a war . . . with education , "" or , "" guns are for cowards , not warriors , "" i'd probably spend the entire film scowling , too . the main problem with dangerous ground even as visceral entertainment is that roodt doesn't know how to do it . he has written himself into a corner by setting up a story like american urban crime stories , but he seems wildly uncomfortable filming traditional action scenes . the result is perhaps the least interesting car chase in recent cinematic history , as two cars chase each other around the spiraling levels of a parking garage , and a climactic gunfight which is edited more with an interest in getting it over with than making it interesting to watch . if this same story had been set in an american city , it would be hooted off the screen for its derivative narrative , stupid characters and limp action . all-too-common ground , as well .

1134,"screenplay : mira nair and helena kriel . producers : mira nair and lydia dean pilcher . director : mira nair . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 119 minutes . it is a frequent lament of critics that movies today seem to be churned out on conveyor belts , each new release looking and sounding just like the one which preceded it . rare is the film to appear on american screens which shows audiences a completely different world , a world like the 16th century indian kingdom which is the setting for kama sutra : a tale of love . in this case , however , i think i understand _why_ we have never seen this world before : apparently , it was the cradle of monotony . kama sutra is a ridiculously tedious study of indian power politics in which writer/director mira nair manages to take exotic locations , torture and plenty of sex and weave them into an uninvolving bore . for about ten minutes , the glorious production design of mark friedberg and the cinematography of declan quinn might allow you to forgive the plodding pace . relish those minutes as you would relish water in the desert . kama sutra rolls along like a block of granite , moving from scene to scene with a wearying lack of grace . nearly every character is one-dimensional , and that one dimension tends to be sullen and unlikeable ; indira varma at least has a certain fresh appeal , but the script turns her into a disney cartoon heroine trying to find something more from life ( though i don't imagine uncle walt would approve of that "" something "" being life in a harem ) . the relationships and conflicts between the characters don't provide much more worth caring about , displaying the kind of melodrama which would make aaron spelling blush . as kama sutra wanders into its second hour , you may find yourself at your watch every five minutes and feeling as though it were moving backwards . you'd think that a film named after an ancient book of sexual wisdom at least might generate some heat , and unfortunately you would be sadly mistaken . there is a fair amount of skin in kama sutra , and a few lengthy sex scenes , but without any real passion or connection developed between the characters nair's direction makes those scenes look like the soft-core porn of a playboy instructional video . even those scenes don't make sex seem as abstract and impersonal as the occasional snippets of kama sutran erotic philosophy dispensed by rasa devi . in this country , rasa devi holds forth on the mystical nature of sexuality like a cross between dr . ruth and yoda , except slightly taller . if someone from another culture were to learn from kama sutra , it is that a droning lecture on sex can be just as soporific as a droning lecture on any other subject . the most distressing thing about kama sutra is what a conventional story it turns out to be , its unique setting notwithstanding . peel away the fuzzy-focus scenes of toe kissing and back scratching and you have a predictable romantic four-some complicated by class , like a jane austen novel with saris . nair and co-scripter helena kriel seem so desperate to make kama sutra seem like a metaphor for something that they toss in a military sub-plot about intrigue to overthrow raj singh which gives the film an overtone of richard iii ; there is even a hunchback prince as a particular reminder . it's still not nearly enough to make kama sutra worth two hours of your life , even with the opportunity in the final moments to see a man executed by being stepped on by an elephant . if this is what passes for showing us new worlds in the movies , sign me up for another year of national geographic .

"" then it became clear that 'til there was you wasn't falling into the sleepless trap . in fact , it was consciously subverting it . and suddenly i was even more depressed that the film i was watching was so painfully tedious . here was the love story i had been waiting for , and it turned out to be an uninvolving , maudlin and incoherent mess . i'm sure that director scott winant and writer winnie holzman thought they were on to something fairly clever when they came up to the concept for 'til there was you , and in theory they were right . it's a wonderfully practical kind of romanticism 'til there was you offers : the idea that true love is the product of two people who meet at a moment when they are both _ready_ for true love . that's the sturdy skeleton of the story , however , not the dead body of a film which was made with it . 'til there was you is all the things the detractors of those shows most detested , without nearly enough of the balancing wit and attention to detail which gave the shows such a devoted following . the two hours of 'til there was you could inspire a lot of watch-checking as it becomes a rambling parade of over-wrought situations and annoying characters , with gwen's picturesque apartment complex -- a cross between melrose place and the garden district where it is perpetually raining rose petals -- becoming more of a recurring joke than a location . the fatal flaw comes with the casting of the romantic leads , and for once the problem isn't that they don't belong together . you're just not likely to care one way or the other . jeanne tripplehorn demonstrates a nice flair for light comedy , but the pleasant-if-kooky character she plays isn't nearly interesting enough to support the story . nick is a complete blank for most of the film , and his sudden conversion from sullen architectural dadaist to lover of all things poetic and ornate makes virtually no sense . thank heaven sarah jessica parker is on hand as the endearingly narcissistic francesca , providing a burst of energy whenever she's in a scene . 'til there was you needs much more of that energy to match its good intentions , instead of 110 minutes of nearly oppressive sincerity . the struggles of real-life relationships don't have to be this dreary , but when they are , the appeal of starry-eyed hokum like sleepless in seattle suddenly makes a lot more sense .

1137,"the most depressing thing about ripe is that you can spot the core of emotional honesty buried beneath the layers of lurid melodrama and clunky symbolism . while male coming-of-age stories litter the film landscape like lost world ticket stubs on a multiplex floor , film-makers appear far more uncomfortable with tackling the sexual awakening of girls . writer/director ogrodinik opted to frame ripe as a sort of surreal cautionary tale , a kids-like warning on the perils of unsupervised youth . there is an absurdity to the things the girls get away with , from shoplifting to wandering through an ammunition shed , but that absurdity is probably part of ogrodnik's point . if anything , ripe may be a feature length public service message on the importance of sex education . it is here that the surrealism and metaphorical heavy-handedness squash ripe like a rotting pomegranate . do impressive work with extremely difficult material , but it is not enough to create characters which are written as types . nothing in ripe feels authentic ; it is a parade of numbingly obvious fore-shadowing and ridiculous situations which shift the emphasis from sensitive observation to spectacle . this shift lends an unnecessary sleaziness to scenes of masturbation and loss of virginity which might have been effective if the situations felt natural . the shock value and controversy of ripe may be good for box office , but they're bad for narrative truth . a less self-consciously "" provocative "" ripe could have been the kind of honest drama which a mother and daughter could share and learn from together . instead , this ripe will likely become more popular at the corner video store with middle-aged men in trenchcoats .

1138,"nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama con air . if the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should . cage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim-witted and ridiculous , and that he's going to have to do something to keep himself entertained . and thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed-up version of raising arizona's h . i . mcdonnough . he got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock , and if there's one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner don simpson ) , it's that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production . the critical difference between the rock and con air is cage's performance . that sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self-awareness . audiences , too , should know what they're getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production . in fact , the marketing people are counting on it . no one who loathed the rock for its swear-grunt-blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air ; no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded . director simon west ( yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab's soda fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it's perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ; like insulin , con air does the work of a gland ) . what he doesn't deliver is a moment of suspense . a bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock's notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really , _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely . if either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension , they might have done something with con air's creepiest set-up . their tete-a-tete is eerie and menacing , providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains ( danny trejo , ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them ) . in fact , con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- too many characters , too much editing , too many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts . it is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance . there's a word for people like you , nicolas . offender .

1139,"squat little extraterrestrial with a telescoping neck . well , actually , it's a golden retriever named buddy . from the trailers and promotions for air bud , you might be expecting a rambunctious sports comedy about a bad-team-made-good in the recent disney tradition , with a hoops-playing pooch leading a basketball team to victory -- sort of the mighty dogs . with a few token exceptions , it's nothing of the kind . screenwriters paul tamasy and aaron mendelsohn want air bud to be a touching story of a lonely boy and his dog , something warm but slow-paced , something decidedly _not_ the mighty dogs . given the formulaic drivel disney usually passes off as live action entertainment , that noble goal alone should have made air bud worth supporting . young kevin zegers is a decent enough actor , but he's fighting against some tough precedents when he tries to make his friendship with buddy uniquely compelling , as well as fighting against charles martin smith's languid direction . the second mistake is purely the fault of disney's marketing department , which will be luring unsuspecting kids and their parents to what they believe is going to be a slapstick comedy . buddy's impressive basketball tricks might make a nice five-minute visit with letterman or leno , but they're not the stuff a feature film is made of . with the exception of one minor chase scene and the big basketball game finale ( which features the ridiculous fiction -- and anyone who has ever been to a middle school basketball game will realize this -- of a middle school basketball game with a score in the 80s and a team which runs a pivot game reminiscent of medowlark lemon-era globetrotters ) , air bud is achingly slow . twice as many children in the screening audience were roaming the aisles as were enraptured by the less-than-antic antics of josh and buddy . it's tough to knock a family film which dares to avoid bodily function humor , but air bud simply has no focus or direction , a fact made abundantly clear when the ridiculous basketball game finale gives way to an even more ridiculous courtroom finale . air bud is really deserving of praise for only one reason : it's not what it's being sold as . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1147,"screenplay : randall wallace , based on the novel by alexandre dumas . producers : randall wallace and russell smith . director : randall wallace . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , sexual situations , violence ) running time : 124 minutes . it is the moment most of the audience -- the non-teenage-female , dicaprio-swooning portion -- has been waiting for . it is a moment guaranteed to inspire pseudo-spontaneous applause and whoops of approval . . . assuming the audience hasn't drifted into a heavy slumber . for around 100 minutes , randall wallace's rendition of the man in the iron mask wanders through attractive sets in search of a consistent tone , thematic coherence or even a real point . is it a lavish , lusty period romp in the spirit of richard lester's 1970s musketeers films ? is it a moody dickensian pot-boiler of a mysterious parentage and uncertain motivations ? is it a showcase for tiger beat poster-boy-du-jour dicaprio ? wallace effectively combined vengeance , romance and adventure in his script for braveheart , but in his first film behind the camera he never seems clear how to unite all the elements he introduces . the man in the iron mask sputters and hesitates like the work of a nervous rookie who just keeps throwing stuff at the screen in the vain hope that , eventually , something's gotta stick . the uninvolving and ponderous first hour and a half leaves a viewer plenty of time to scratch at minor annoyances until they become major annoyances . meticulously smudged rabble rouse themselves for a minor riot for exactly one scene , perhaps to distract momentarily from the impression that this is an epic with a cast of tens . half the cast speaks with french accents ( all genuine , courtesy depardieu , anne parillaud and plasticine ingenue judith godreche ) , while the other half appears to have wandered in from malibu , or london , or dublin . given the chance to bite into louis xiv's nastiness with relish , dicaprio instead gives him a tiresome method twist which suggests he just wants to be loved . all might have been forgiven if only wallace had played the musketeer trump card for all it was worth . he's got viewers right where he wants them with such iconic characters at his disposal ; the good will is as palpable as it is at a james bond film , where the mere utterance of a trademark phrase generates a ripple of excitement . there's just no good excuse to waste that kind of good will on one or two rounds of lackluster swordplay . dumas wrote wonderful pulp ; wallace tries to turn that pulp into something it's not , only he's not exactly sure what that is . the man in the iron mask is a big muddled mess of an adventure yarn , satisfying only for those interested in going to watch dicaprio in regal finery looking his prettiest . others will find a waste of stellar cast and classic story which never gets a handle on what the film should have been about for the average viewer : a chance to cheer for the crossed swords of re-born legends just a bit earlier than 100 minutes after the lights go down . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1149,"screenplay : michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin . director : mimi leder . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , intense scenes ) running time : 115 minutes . if ever a film begged -- nay _pleaded_ -- to be a mini-series , that film is deep impact . that's enough flashing to give you the disorienting sensation of sitting through a cinematic strobe light . deep impact wants to be a heroic disaster epic , examining the effect of impending devastation on individual people and their relationships , but that can only happen if we get to know the characters a little . every one of deep impact's sub-plots feels forced into a chunk of time far too small to do it justice . in fact , it often seems as though every bit of character interaction has been edited out of deep impact except the tear-filled separations and reunions , leaving little more than a hollow succession of musical cues . that may not be a tremendous surprise when you're dealing with a big-budget disaster film . what should come as a surprise is deep impact's disappointing lack of visual energy . this is one sedate blockbuster , offering one invigorating set piece of the messiah mission before settling into a dull march towards five minutes of destruction . every other opportunity to dazzle is either turned into exposition or ignored entirely . we never even get to see the massive underground ark after a huge narrative build-up . deep impact is so bereft of spectacle and detail that it's never possible to grasp the immensity of the impending tragedy , or watch a year of mounting dread unfold . in fact , i can't imagine a more absurdly optimistic portrayal of human reaction to the coming apocalypse , with the isolated traffic jam and a few fires being the only intrusion on a general response of beatific acceptance . it may be the end of the world as they know it , but they feel fine . deep impact boasts such a talented cast -- duvall , freeman , redgrave , schell , charles martin smith , james cromwell -- that occasionally it feels weightier than the script deserves . mimi leder's direction also offers a few effective moments , including a montage of reaction shots which provides more insight than all the dialogue combined . most of the time , however , deep impact feels like six hours of raw footage hacked to ribbons to meet the imperatives of feature film length . it's not exactly a bad film ; it's just about one-third of an acceptably engrossing one . if you want to do justice to an extinction level event , you need the 366 minutes of 1994's television adaptation of stephen king's the stand . deep impact's 115 minutes manage to turn a comet strike into a moderate inconvenience . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1150,"i envy forest whitaker , because he's one man who doesn't have to hear that accusation most men hear when it comes to "" women's films "" : that he "" just doesn't get it . "" i'm sure someone somewhere will accuse me of "" just not getting "" hope floats . what i really didn't get was how whitaker could take a fairly simple story and make it so ragged and unfocused . hope floats might have worked if it had explored its unique premise for all its dramatic and comedic possibilities . surrounding an emotionally wounded housewife with people who knew her as a teen beauty queen -- and who most likely harbor a secret delight at her failure -- would be a fascinating way to to watch her grow up and come to terms with the unreasonable expectations of her youth . instead , hope floats relegates that context to a few isolates snippets , opting instead to focus on plastic relationship dynamics . harry connick jr . plays the role of the nice guy with such obvious puppy dog likeabilty that there's never a moment's tension in the romance between him and bullock . the mother-daughter relationship between bullock and rowlands is similarly tepid , despite a pleasant performance by rowlands in the role of conspicuous eccentric ( she practices home taxidermy ) . the film never feels like anyone knows exactly where it should go , what we should be learning about birdee , and why her story should matter to us at all . part of the problem -- perhaps a very large part -- is the casting of bullock in the lead role . bullock is a charming actress with a killer smile , but she doesn't appear to have the faintest idea how to play this character . so what she does is smile , and smile constantly , in every possible context to display every possible emotion . it makes a certain sense that the one-time miss congeniality would be an inveterate smiler , but her smile is used as substitute for characterization , as though it won't matter that we don't understand her at all as long as we find her so darned nice . this generally scattered approach to the material carries through whitaker's direction -- in cross-cutting which blunts emotional impact , in abrupt changes of focus , in an over-dependence on caleb deschanel's silky cinematography . their story -- the story of how absentee parents affect children's lives -- is infinitely more involving than birdee's rather mundane and inevitable trip to "" finding herself "" ( i . e . sure there are a few sniffles and chuckles along the way , but nothing nearly as potent as bernice howling in pain as her father leaves her behind . maybe forest whitaker will end up demonstrating a knack for "" getting "" the stories of children . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

"" six days , seven nights actually contains a few amusing gags , with both heche and ford -- long under-appreciated for his comic timing -- scoring some comic hits . they just have almost nothing to work with , squirming around with absurd situations and stick-figure characters . the film's few simple pleasures , including the lovely kauai scenery , are lost in the search for some reason to root for these people ending up together . the fact that there's nothing "" credible "" about the pairing of robin and quinn has nothing to do with anne heche's choice of real-life romantic partners . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1152,"even the name before the film has changed , with disney shuttling the sequel from its flagship banner to dimension , the genre division of miramax ( apparently realizing the original had too few fart jokes to qualify as a live-action disney film ) . i only wish that with all those changes they could have rustled up a new screenwriting team . naturally this leads to amusing sequences of buddy befuddling opposing defenses as he makes like jerry rice . but wait , there's more ! the original air bud had good intentions and solid family values to spare , but it tied them up in such derivative and unfocused package that even the kids in the audience couldn't keep their attention on the precocious pooch . new director richard martin picks up the pace considerably this time around , but he can't do much to create any cohesiveness with this story . from moment to moment , it's hard to tell whether air bud : golden receiver is supposed to be an afterschool special , a john hughes film or an episode of rocky and bullwinkle ( though with considerably less wit ) . it's also hard to take seriously a film where a premise so bizarre is shrugged off as a given . this time around , buddy trots onto the field in his leather helmet and shoulder pads as though it were the most natural thing in the world . perhaps somewhere on the cutting room floor is a scene in which an arbitrator cites the "" air bud "" precedent . without such a scene , everything that follows seems a little insulting to the intelligence , and an indication of how lazy the screenwriters were that they couldn't come up with some creative way to land buddy on the team . i'm not pretending that air bud : golden receiver was made with me in mind . this one is a short attention span kiddie-caper which did have the young ones clapping and guffawing with some regularity , and perhaps that counts for something . it even features a few decent throwaway gags , including a llama named dolly and a splendidly off-key rendition of the american national anthem . there's just something vaguely desperate about this whole air bud franchise -- they have build not just one film but a series of them on what amounts to a better-than-average stupid pet trick . sure , it's harmless enough , but the frantic amalgamation of disparate elements gave me a headache . it's a bit frightening to note that the original buddy's trainer kevin dicicco is putting together another project , air bud : the next generation . perhaps in the course of teaching a new dog a new trick , he could teach a new screenwriting team one i'd really love to see : how to write a script that might appeal to someone over the age of five . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1153,"mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , adult themes , nudity ) running time : 121 minutes . adding delilah to the mix certainly adds some spice to the second-chance romance story line , particularly with goldberg in the role . sure , goldberg is doing little more than an extended funky-sassy miss thang riff , but she's always fun to watch , timing her salacious or sarcastic comments impeccably . instead of the novel's hyper-introspective first person narrative , stella on screen offers a bit more interplay , and a bit more fun . so much for the short-term benefit . as talented and forceful an actor as angela bassett can be , she plays stella with too much exuberant confidence . delilah's influence is pervasive as the relationship blossoms ; the bump-n-grind stella we see in jamaica appears to have far too much groove still in her to need getting any of it back . the combination of unfocused motivations and little comic relief proves fatal in the film's final 45 minutes , when it becomes a genuine butt-numbing ordeal . the story simply has nowhere left to go but around in circles : there's some relationship talk , a bit of romance , tense moments , and more relationship talk , all of it surrounding a relationship with not nearly enough chemistry to be involving . newcomer taye diggs , doing a barely serviceable jamaican accent , has all the boyish charm the role needs with about a tenth of the mature-beyond-his-years wisdom it requires . that leaves a whole lot of grating will-they-or-won't-they vacillation over a pairing that , on screen , doesn't make much sense . bass and mcmillan seemed to realize that the very internalized nature of how stella got her groove back required something different to work as a film . the big change they made had it heading in the right direction , but it only emphasized how truly un-cinematic the rest of the story could be . whoopi goldberg may chew up the lovely island scenery , but at least she presents something worth holding your attention for an hour or so . she also makes the rest of the film look like it's about a different kind of groove : the run-out groove . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1154,"mike myers transforms himself in 54 , in virtually every way a performer can transform himself . in his first truly dramatic screen performance , myers is still recognizable with his open-mouthed little boy grin , but here he uses it to create an overgrown little boy convinced he can only find friends by throwing the coolest party . rubell is a fascinating character , performed by myers with a mix of savvy , pathos and self-absorption . if writer/director mark christopher had had the common sense to make 54 the story of steve rubell , he might have created a great film . 54's base-line narrative is so trite it almost plays like a parody , a disco-era goof on midnight cowboy or some far less seminal corruption of the innocent melodrama . perhaps it was his idea of irony : like studio 54 itself , his movie invites people in so they can stand around and be attractive . the plotting and pacing are so relentlessly predictable that the film doesn't even work well as a sociology lesson . shane's voice-over narration dutifully informs us why studio 54 was so unique and popular , but there's never enough energy for us to believe him or care . 54 spends 91 minutes pointing off-handedly at this or that detail like a bored tour guide . for a film that includes money-laundering , ripping off the mob , sex , drugs , celebrities and plenty of boogie oogie oogie-ing , it almost never gets the pulse racing . the notable exceptions are the scenes involving myers as rubell . sure , the character isn't perfectly realized ; in fact , it probably seems better simply because it's surrounded by so much uninspired junk . it's also amusing watching him tell a talk show host "" the road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom "" after we've seen him lying in a pile of money , drooling vomit . there's a great story in that unhappy collection of contradictions , but you won't find it amidst the smothering cliches of mark christopher's script . with all the stranger-than-fiction truth at his disposal , he somehow found the least interesting approach possible . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1156,"one of the things you've gotta love about hollywood marketing people is their occasional bouts with irony deficiency . if you trusted television advertisements for holy man , you'd probably suspect that it was a raucous eddie murphy comedy where the star spends most of the film mocking and deflating uptight media types . that's because touchstone pictures' marketing department knew it'd have one hellacious time trying to sell holy man for what it really is : a somber , sincere satire-cum-cautionary tale in which eddie murphy , despite his lead billing , generally plays second fiddle to jeff goldblum . the wonderful , awful irony comes from the "" message "" of holy man . goldblum plays ricky hayman , the programming director for miami-based good buy shopping network . as g's success reinvigorates ricky's career , ricky begins to wonder whether it's more important to be honest with people than to use any means available to sell to them . pretty good gag , huh ? only the joke will be on viewers who expect to have their funny bones tickled , but instead get a nearly two-hour lecture on the evils of consumerism . murphy , meanwhile , gets a few devilish moments of his own -- you know , the ones in the commercials -- but essentially spends the film's running time smiling beatifically and waxing profound on the importance of love and connection with the earth . it's all very well-intentioned , and deadly dull . the sad part is that holy man could have been an effective piece of satire . the script by tom schulman presents g as a latter-day howard beale or chance the gardener unknowingly tapping into some zeitgeist malaise . unfortunately , if you're going to go for network or being there-style stabs at modern media , you need someone a bit more cutting edge at the helm than stephen herek ( the mighty ducks , mr . herek wraps everything in a warm-n-fuzzy package guaranteed not to offend , a pointless perspective for a social satire . even the few token pokes at infomercialism , including cameo pitch-meisters like morgan fairchild , betty white and soupy sales , are too feather-light to amount to much . wasting a chance to savage as ripe a target as home shopping should be a criminal offense . it's similarly criminal wasting the presence of eddie murphy . i understand murphy's recent move toward kinder , gentler , family-friendly roles , since there are only so many ways to play the wise-cracking rebel with the honking laugh . the problem isn't his performance in holy man , which is quite adequate for the minimal work he's actually required to do . the problem is that no matter how hard murphy tries to be a "" versatile actor , "" he's going to be in trouble with audiences if marketing geniuses keep suckering his fans into watching a murphy they don't really care to see . i'm glad murphy felt strongly enough about holy man's message of integrity to take a chance playing against type , but he could have picked a less tedious vehicle . it's even worse when touchstone makes him look like a certain pot referring to a certain kettle's ebony shading . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1157,"david webb peoples has contributed to some of the most compelling screenplays of recent years . peoples has shown a facility for turning genre films into films of ideas . the specific ideas with which he has concerned himself held out the hope that soldier might be something more than this week's disposable bit of whoop-it-up mayhem . i suspect that peoples's original script focused on how the functionally anti-social todd begins to explore human interaction for the first time . that's not the story director paul anderson insists on telling . though in his production notes anderson describes the story as "" shane in outer space , "" he actually makes it much more like rambo in outer space . the final half-hour generally finds todd picking off his faceless adversaries like red-shirts in a "" star trek "" episode , occasionally interrupted by immense explosions and flying bodies . never mind that caine is a programmed soldier just like todd himself , and that it would be much more interesting to sympathize with him than to cheer his inevitable defeat mindlessly . there's nothing inherently wrong with black hat/white hat action adventures where we watch a bit of carnage and root for good to triumph over evil . the problem is that anderson pretends soldier is more than that , offering scenes of todd perplexed by a tear rolling down his face , or recoiling at displays of kindness . moments that might have been genuinely affecting instead inspire derisive laughter , because anderson is far more interested in visceral response than in emotional response . ironically , he spends most of the film reveling in dehumanizing violence instead of showing how dehumanizing violence created his protagonist . i can't believe that's the story david webb peoples wanted to tell , which is what makes soldier more disappointing than it might otherwise be . he turned over a smart idea to a director determined to make a dumb movie . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1159,"screenplay : woody allen . director : woody allen . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 113 minutes . woody allen's detractors have had a laundry list of gripes about his films for many years now . his neurotic screen persona had grown increasingly shrill and annoying , they said ; his cinematic world of white upper-manhattanites had grown ever more insular . as the lines between his convoluted personal life and his baldly autobiographical films grew blurrier by the year , the anti-woody contingent began to consider him a vaguely pathetic has-been , the film-making equivalent of frank sinatra -- more famous in the later stages of his career for who he used to be than for who he still was . it took watching kenneth branagh's grating gloss on allen's mannerisms in celebrity for me to sympathize with that side of the great woody debate . it's easy to see the potential in celebrity for exploring the foibles of fame and the absurdity of a culture that bestows fame for all the wrong reasons . unfortunately , lee is never a remotely sympathetic character , primarily because branagh is too preoccupied with mimicking the woodman to find anything true in the character . judy davis is more effective as the emotionally fragile robin , but her character arc is only slightly more compelling . the film's two central characters are contrivances ; worse , they're often annoying contrivances , twisted knots of self-doubt and self-loathing whose happiness couldn't matter less to us . without any emotional center , celebrity becomes a series of stand-alone vignettes about the strange and self-absorbed things famous people do . allen can still manage to pull out a few one-line zingers ( including self-deprecating takes on "" pretentious film-makers who shoot everything in black-and-white "" ) , but they're few and far between in this film . sequences that should build to a great comic payoff , like lee's wild night with dicaprio's bad boy actor , just seem to drag on until it's time to start the next scene . the lack of invention in celebrity gives you plenty of time to notice how stale allen's act has become . for every decent gag ( a film producer referring to his next project , "" an all-black version of 'birth of a nation' "" ) , there are half a dozen that turned up in a previous woody allen film . celebrity , a film which should have been wonderfully timely in the daytime talk show era , shows little cutting-edge satiric bite . perhaps it's even more ironic that he's showing himself to be one of those famous people so far removed from ordinary life that he doesn't know what we might find absurd , or that he himself may now be one of those people famous for all the wrong reasons . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1160,"screenplay : george miller , judy morris and mark lamprell . director : george miller . running time : 95 minutes . like a classic storybook tale , 1995's babe was set no-where and no-when in particular . the singular world in which the rosy , glowing hoggett farm and its chattering menagerie existed added to the charm that made the original film a surprise hit and an oscar-nominee . babe : pig in the city takes that anywhere-ness a step farther . . . actually , a step too far . it's a cute gag the first time , but it also signals a not-so-subtle shift in tone from babe . the setting is no longer anywhere , but everywhere ; the story isn't just a fantasy where anything could happen , but one where the film-makers try to make everything happen . babe : pig in the city is so full of plots and sub-plots that saving the hoggett farm practically becomes an afterthought , with a resolution so silly it almost seems a waste of time . you might suspect that a pace that frantic would be a sop to younger viewers , but it's hard to imagine george miller ( who produced the original and also directs here ) had kids in mind making this film . a catastrophic performance by a low-rent circus ( featuring mickey rooney in a weird cameo as a clown of indeterminate personality ) turns into a moody and murky slow-motion sequence like something out of platoon ; later , a dog with a bad heart has a near-death experience with pastoral visions . babe certainly had a few dark moments , but nothing like the consistently creepy feel of pig in the city . miller may have been playing to the kiddies when mrs . hoggett goes bouncing around a reception hall in inflatable pants , but not when a dog insults a cat with an epithet that could be interpreted as quite vulgar . ironically , that strangely mature tone introduces the film's only truly compelling element , a melancholy performing orangutan named thelonious ( voice of james cosmo ) . he's a mysterious presence who can't seem to bear the idea that he's not human , and both the animal and vocal performances are wonderfully sympathetic . i sat just a bit forward in my seat every time thelonious appeared , gradually realizing that this one character also served to point out how bland the rest of the characters are in babe : pig in the city . there are too many animals milling about to care about any of them all that much ; even the little pig himself seems to have been sapped of personality . the easy rapport between babe and farmer hoggett ( relegated here to little more than a glorified cameo ) is sorely missed . then again , a whole lot of things from babe are sorely missed . it's a nice change of pace to find a sequel that doesn't merely try to remake the original , but babe : pig in the city lack any of the original's endearing gentle spirit . it's so hyped-up and busy , it's almost as though john hughes got hold of our sweet little pig and tossed him into a home alone sequel . this is one major holiday disappointment , a storybook tale that should have quit with its original happy ending . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1161,"about forty minutes into stepmom , i came to a numbing realization . . . well , two actually . the first was that i knew exactly where this domestic drama was headed and could predict scenes and confrontations far down the road . the second was that i knew we were still 90 minutes away from the closing credits . as the film ever-so-slowly unfolded , i began to realize what five credited screenwriters can buy you : perhaps the most inefficient screenplay of the year . there's some promising human drama in the premise , which begins with conflict in an extended family . that's an interesting enough twist on the complicated emotions and allegiances of extended family interactions , one that could have made a tidy feature weeper . unfortunately , absolutely nothing about stepmom could be called tidy . if a situation or relationship calls for a scene to establish it , stepmom provides two or three . stepmom appears to have no faith that we'll understand the significance of a character's actions unless those actions are underlined , making it both insulting and redundant . every turn of character is so deliberately structured , you might suspect that every subsequent screenwriter came in just to add another half dozen scenes , and no one threw anything out . stepmom's narrative unwieldiness also makes it extremely hard to connect with any of the many plot lines . ed harris , meanwhile , struggles just to find a few minutes of screen time . with all the complexities involved in these family dynamics , dear old dad remains a complete enigma . "" you're a great dad , "" jackie tells luke in once scene ; "" i just never gave you the chance to realize it . "" that sentiment will probably apply to the entire audience , which may forget there's a father anywhere to be found . for a film about getting your priorities straight , stepmom sure doesn't . of course , it's understood that this is to be a showcase for the two lead actresses , and we shouldn't begrudge them a showcase when lead actresses generally get the treatment harris gets here . roberts and sarandon are both quite good in their roles , sarandon in particular bringing a wonderful steely maternalism . they're just stuck in the kind of film which has become director chris columbus' specialty : cheap comic relief which gives way to big messages of understanding . stepmom is a big emotional mess of a movie , one which grows increasingly irritating as karaoke production numbers and one tearful goodbye after another chew up minutes of screen time . good actors deserve better than a script that -- strangely enough -- looks like pieces of the work of five different writers stitched together to form a movie . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1165,"it's okay for a horror film to be a metaphor ; in fact , they can work best on an underlying psychological level . a scary film can be more than just scary , but it shouldn't work so hard at it that the whole thing becomes a pretentious , preposterous mess . ravenous is just such a convoluted concoction , throwing mountains of sub-text at its tale of cannibalism in the vain hope that something might stick , instead of merely "" ick . "" every once in a while , when ravenous settles down for some good old-fashioned terror tension , you can almost enjoy it . there are a few nicely staged confrontations and creepy moments in antonia bird's direction ( or perhaps that of milcho manchevski , the director replaced two weeks into production ) , including a sequence involving a sneak attack that builds far longer than you might think possible . writer ted griffin slips a few darkly comic lines into the dialogue , and robert carlyle's manic performance helps support that tone whenever he's on screen . how much more tolerable ravenous might have been if griffin and bird had been content to let the black comedy guide them . instead , it becomes a potpourri of narrative notions and random themes : the dehumanizing destruction of battle ( i . e . , war itself as cannibalism ) , the mad drive for the american frontier ( i . e . , the manifest destiny as cultural/ecological cannibalism ) , the equally mad drive for the gold in them thar hills ( i . e . , the gold rush as economic cannibalism ) , plus yet another gloss on addiction , and on and on to a dizzying degree , with the native american myth of the weendigo thrown in for good measure . boyd's tortured quandary over whether to join this particular diners' club is played as such grand opera , infused with such socio-political baggage , that guy pearce looks like he's carrying the entire weight of western civilization on his shoulders in every scene . no one's saying that the jaunty gruesomeness of eating raoul is the only possible approach for a successful foray into same-species snacking . it may , however , be the best approach . when jeffrey jones is cracking wise while supping on a human stew , ravenous begins to emerge from its coma of self-importance ; when he pleads to be relieved of the misery of his hunger , you wonder when he suddenly developed a character of any significance . at a certain point , ravenous becomes so consumed with putting a heady spin on its subject matter that it consumes itself . a horror film with something to say between shocks is fine . it's rare -- and annoying -- to find one that just won't shut up . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1169,"there are few central dramatic conflicts trickier to pull off -- or more potentially annoying -- than a mid-life crisis . the protagonist can easyily become unsympathetic , his introspection little more than self-indulgence . it's rare to find a character with the potential to turn a family man's grass-is-always-greener musings into something compelling , but that's exactly what we find in chris lloyd ( christian bale ) , the central figure in metroland . what a shame that potential isn't remotely realized . metroland is a character study with huge chunks of context missing , a surface-level gloss on the clash between youthful idealism and adult responsibility . plenty of things about chris are intriguing conceptually . as mid-life crisis material goes , this is pretty unique stuff : a man who strays not so much because he's unhappy with what he has , but because he figures he's _supposed_ to be unhappy . don't make the mistake of assuming director philip saville and screenwriter adrian hodges will flesh out those ideas . it never spends enough time developing the friendship with toni that will color chris' entire life . it never explores toni's character in any depth , relying on third-party psychoanalysis to explain his motivations . there's a consistent superficiality to metroland , a refusal to give the characters a depth that makes plot developments -- like a late revelation regarding marion -- feel anything but arbitrary and exploitative . there's some nice atmosphere to metroland , particularly from mark knopfler's silky score and an effective period look , but it doesn't come close to making up for the narrative shortcomings . it doesn't help that seville uses inefficient techniques like cross-cutting with 1977 chris' pondering face throughout the 1968 flashbacks , or that christian bale's performance is most notable for his perpetual petulant pout . it's a film in which the only clarity comes from its most obvious observations . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

's performance . a little economy and subtlety -- skills hopkins demonstrates even when playing a wild man -- could have served gooding well . sadly , subtlety is one thing instinct has in very short supply . even viewers prepared to sympathize with the film's fuzzy embrace of the state of nature will find this more a philosophical tract ( albeit one with remarkably realistic animatronic apes by stan winston ) than a compelling drama . we all know man bad/animals good , which makes the decision to turn the humans into cartoonish villains even more perplexing . if there were a moment of real insight into a character , the rest of instinct's brainless cinematic thievery might have been more tolerable . instead , it lets breathing plot devices gab at one another for two hours between unnervingly familiar situations . thank heavens for the entertainment value of anthony hopkins' gloss on film's best-known cannibal . it's only fitting in a film that does plenty of cannibalizing of its own . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1173,"director : jan de bont . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity , violence ) running time : 110 minutes . it's too bad there couldn't have been a bit more distance between the release of the blair witch project and the making of the haunting -- then , at least , director jan de bont wouldn't have had an excuse . with recent history to consider , it may have made a perverse economic sense to turn shirley jackson's supremely creepy story into a special effects-filled funhouse . then along comes blair witch to prove that you can still rattle an audience with what might be happening rather than a computer-generated representation of what is happening . ironically , blair witch owes a debt to the original 1963 version of the haunting in its study of the psychology of fear . sadly , the haunting circa 1999 owes a debt to jan ( twister , speed 2 ) de bont in its study of thick-headed filmmaking . an even more bitter irony is that this version of the haunting gathers its characters for a study of the psychology of fear . researcher jeffrey marrow ( liam neeson ) brings together three subjects for an experiment , telling them only that it's a study of insomnia . it's fairly clear from the start that the real star of the haunting is the house itself . de bont sprinkles the film liberally with sweeping helicopter shots of the sprawling exterior ; he prowls through the bending hallways and pans across cavernous great rooms ; he lets cinematographer caleb deschanel bathe the ornate bedrooms in muted oranges and reds . eugenio zanetti's production design is certainly eye-catching , offering more detail than one could possibly absorb in one sitting , but at a certain point the sprawling staginess of the house starts to work against the film . it begins to feel like disney's haunted mansion crossed with the winchester mystery house , a tourist attraction designed more for spooky giggles than for genuine shivers . once the house fails to deliver the creepiness , you're left with the treatment of the material , which is literalist to the mundane extreme . robert wise's 1963 the haunting was hardly perfect -- julie harris' hand-wringing fussiness took her nell too far over the edge from the start -- but it began from the principle that fear is about anticipation , not revelation . de bont has no interest in any such subtleties . instead of making a film about the way an environment of terror is more powerful in imagination than in reality , he makes a film about faces appearing in pillowcases , leaping skeletons , windows that turn into big staring eyeballs , and living statues a la ray harryhausen . with its foundation-shaking finale and monstrous apparitions , this isn't a remake of the haunting . it's a remake of poltergeist . of course there's a place for the poltergeists of cinema . generally , however , it helps if that sort of film can tap into something primal , like scary clowns or menacing trees . the haunting can't really be classified as a horror film , because there's nothing remotely horrifying about it , unless you count the inanely expository dialogue ( e . g . , a character reacting to a stairway collapsing : "" look , the stairway is collapsing ! "" ) . in fact , it's often downright laughable -- sometimes intentionally ( owen wilson's goofball performance ) , sometimes not ( a blissed-out otherworldly ending that makes ghost look restrained ) . de bont has made a film from the school of quips and money shots , all flash and chuckle . he's merely interested in showing off his big-budget toys so everyone can see the thing that goes ooga-booga . that's a pretty limp take on a tale of the ooga-boogas inside our heads . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"" kaplan shoots bridge sequences as elaborate music videos , turning his actresses into cute models instead of tormented characters . with a script by first-time screenwriter david arata that forgets sub-plots and provides simplistic outrage , brokedown palace proves itself to be fairly lazy film-making . it pre-digests its story into over-wrought melodrama . it's fairly obvious from the get-go that his character arc will be straight out of casablanca -- a jaded pseudo-rick blaine who gives up his own financial interest for the greater good -- but pullman is an interesting enough actor to pull it off . unfortunately , his story also pulls us away from the two central characters . though in a way that's a good thing -- the fewer scenes spent in the meticulously unpleasant prison , the better -- it's also a distraction from alice's theoretically central conversion to selfless friend . comparisons between brokedown palace and last year's return to paradise are inevitable -- both are tales of americans languishing abroad , seasoned with self-sacrifice for the sake of a friend . but as uneven as return to paradise was , it approached every similar point with more provocative shades of gray . kaplan and arata want desperately for the plight of their characters to matter , but the final hour is too irretrievably phony to provide an emotional pull . viewers who find this sort of morality play uplifting may find their hearts swelling at the conclusion . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"" in both cases , he managed the nifty trick of subverting the conventions of a genre -- teen horror and teen angst melodrama , respectively -- while still satisfying the traditional audience for each . tingle , an early williamson script dusted off for his first stint in the director's chair , seems to have been written before williamson figured out tone and avoiding cliches . as a teen drama , it's soggy and predictable ; as a thriller , it's a soggy and predictable teen drama ; as a comedy , it's a soggy and predictable teen drama . you might be expecting a dark satirical comedy from that set-up , or perhaps a humor-laced thriller . tingle , which instead opts for absurd sincerity . holmes is an appealing actress , but she's stuck looking pensive and wounded much of the time , thinking deep thoughts while the soundtrack blares with angsty rock . her ostensible growth from timid schoolgirl to self-assured woman is the heart of the film , and a frighteningly weak heart it is . introspection and depth of character has rarely felt such a bore , or so wildly inappropriate . sadly , the same could be said for helen mirren's performance as mrs . tingle . mirren goes for the jugular with every line , and she has some fantastic moments . williamson , unfortunately , isn't sure quite what to do with her . the many sides of eve tingle don't add up to a multi-faceted character . they add up to confusion . the farcical gags with tambor's masochistic coach are over-played , especially when juxtaposed with leigh ann's sympathy for the coach's unsuspecting wife . coughlan's funky energy , and williamson's fairly effective pacing , keep inspiring the hope that something entertaining will be just around the corner . even when he's flopping , williamson is still subverting genre expectations . he's taken a provocative dark comedy thriller and turned it into mush . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1180,"screenplay : kevin smith . director : kevin smith . kevin smith's dogma is offensive . devotees of film industry scuttlebutt probably know that miramax , dogma's original distributor , put the film on the auction block after religious groups started turning up the heat . catholic organizations in particular declaimed the film's subject matter , many proclaiming it sacrilegious sight unseen ( "" i don't need to swim in a sewer to know it stinks , "" went one typical slice of logic ) . it won't surprise any of those folks when i say dogma is offensive . and i'm not even talking about the theological content . dogma should be offensive to anyone who expects more from a movie than two hours of a filmmaker's musings on every religious notion that ever came into his head . those musings are linked -- rather tenuously -- to a plot involving the very fate of existence itself . and oh boy , are there plenty of lengthy conversations . smith's eternity-threatening premise is probably meant to distract from an otherwise non-stop series of metaphysical/scriptural/doctrinal discussions on everything from the nature of god to religious intolerance . it doesn't . dogma is an incredibly long sit , a deep-n-profound dorm room debate of a movie without the benefit of cold pizza and beer . sometimes smith is simply snarky ( a deconstruction of "" the walrus and the carpenter "" as a critique of organized religion ) , in which cases he often churns out genuine laughs . when smith actually does get into the events of his plot , things don't get much better . smith has always been a filmmaker only in the most nominal sense , but his limitations are even more evident when he makes a half-hearted effort to add supernatural action to the mix ( radically shifting the tone from comedy to grim violence along the way ) . in a way , the low-tech fight sequences have their charms ; battles always seem to occur just outside the frame , and people come flying through the air from improbable directions . it's hard to cut smith that much slack , though , because you can't help but think his choices are based entirely on his limited visual vocabulary . he'll point a camera at people sitting around a table as long as you'll let him . i suppose the most frustrating thing about dogma is that , whatever your feelings about its messages , kevin smith is the wrong messenger . it's not that his insights aren't insightful -- he has some interesting things to say about faith , religions and self-righteousness -- but that he's pitching his weighty notions in such a scattershot fashion . life of brian could get away with borderine sacrilege because monty python played it smart and scathing ; dogma may be a sincere expression of belief , but it's too juvenile too often . smith opens the film with a disclaimer that the film is only meant to be a satire , then includes a comment to the effect that "" god must have a sense of humor . . . you simply _must_ do better than that if you want to turn sacred cows into fajitas . i hope smith feels better about religion after venting his spleen into a feature film . losing two hours to deep thoughts wrapped in limp jokes -- now _that_ i find offensive . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1182,"if i could be sure what the legend of 19900 is supposeed to be about -- or have any sympathy for what i suspect it's about -- i might actually have enjoyed it . there are certainly some appealing technical elements in giuseppe tornatore's "" fable "" about a strange character named nineteen hundred ( tim roth ) . for a while , the gilded romanticism of the legend of 1900 makes it easy on the eyes and ears . cinematographer lajos koltai burnishes every frame with a mysterious light , filling the film with a sense of epic nostalgia . the music is frequently captivating as well , with ennio morricone's haunting themes building interest in the eccentric nineteen hundred . music also anchors the film's best sequence , in which jazz legend jelly roll morton ( clarence williams iii ) comes to the virginian to challenge nineteen hundred to a piano "" duel . "" it's all quite fanciful , given an undercurrent of consequence by pruitt taylor vince's performance of thousand-yard stares , flashing back to the friendship that changed max's life . in retrospect , vince deserves immense praise for his work , since he manages to convey the idea that this story has something profound to say . it's actually quite a preposterous piece of work , as it turns out , and not because of its protagonist's unique life . tornatore just doesn't give us any sense of who nineteen hundred is or what he's all about . he isn't so much a character as he is a deliberate enigma -- not becuase he's complex , but because tornatore wants to make him an all-purpose archetype . tim roth gamely tries to give nineteen hundred a human face , but in this "" fable "" he's not really playing a human . he's just a metaphor for something or other . if forced to guess what he's a metaphor for , i'd have to say it ties in with early themes in the film about immigrants coming to america . the legend of 1900 might have worked as a sympathetic , affectionate acknowledgement of those whose fears held them back . there's something vaguely pathetic about his paean to boundaries ; it's even more pathetic if we're expected to find him somehow noble in his obsessive fear . the theme also appears far too late in the story , leaving you to wonder about all the preceding filler that simply confuses the question of what this character is all about . eventually , the film implodes under the weight of the importance placed on nineteen hundred's life . it turns out we've been suckered into caring about the fate of a vague symbol , and maybe a vague symbol for something foolish and sad . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1185,"every once in a while , i come upon a movie where i simply can't get beyond the basic premise ; as well as certain individual elements might be executed , i'm so turned off by that premise that i can't possibly enjoy the film . there is some charm to be found in the performances , but overall it simply depressed me , and wrapped up a disturbing package far too neatly . becomes the tale of a cruel prank perpetrated on a deeply disturbed little boy , and it becomes extremely unpleasant to watch . aims for an inappropriately upbeat conclusion . dad makes a relatively sincere apology , but for a film which uses serious family problems to set up its hijinks , it's disappointingly timid in dealing with the repercussions . a certain amount of contrivance is practically required in capers such as this , but josh and s . a . m . really pushes the envelope . the event which forces josh to run is a strained sequence involving chris penn as a drunken texan , and he really doesn't work . most baffling is the role played by martha plimpton , an ill-defined runaway who appears and disappears without leaving any recognizable imprint on the story . somewhere in that character was a relevant back-story , but it never made it to the screen . there is even a tossed-off attempt to make her a romantic interest for josh , which is raised and resolved in under five minutes of screen time . as disturbed and disappointed as i was in the story , i have to acknowledge the appeal of the two lead performances . jacob tierney is very good as the bright and resourceful josh , best of all in the obligatory "" fool the stupid cop "" sequence , and noah fleiss brings real heartbreak to the truly confused sam . the two are convincing brothers throughout , and i liked the rapport between them . still , i found myself dwelling on its handling of a serious subject matter in a manner i found inappropriate . there is no such thing as an objective review , but in this case i can't even pretend otherwise . i found nothing fun about watching two kids in desperate need of therapy taking a joy ride .

1186,"director : matthew warchus . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 106 minutes . sometimes , a play makes for a good film . sometimes it doesn't . it's tough to put a finger on what can make a stage-to-screen translation fall flat , but i know it when i see it . sometimes it feels as though a filmmaker doesn't know how to make a set piece feel like a film ; other times the director seems to be doing little more than turning the film over to the actors reciting their lines . it can also become oleanna . simpatico doesn't fail because director matthew warchus can't give sam shepard's play a distinctly cinematic life ( he does ) or that he lets the actors run roughshod over the production ( he does that too , but it's not the fatal flaw ) . in this case , the play itself is the thing . structurally , simpatico is about as sound a script as they come . revelations about the characters' pasts appear ever-so-gradually , each one adding a shade of significance to events that have gone before . as a tale of guilt and coming to terms with one's mistakes , it's intriguing enough consistently enough that you'll want to keep paying attention . it even offers some genuinely cinematic pleasures , from john toll's eclectic cinematography to stewart copeland's jangly soundtrack . far from the too-typical 1990s script of 1-2-3 plot development , simpatico's story clicks along with unique rhythms . those rhythms just happen to be the rhythms of a play . no matter what is happening on screen in simpatico , it never for a moment feels like the story belongs on film . the characters speak to each other in the clipped tones of a dialogue-dependent medium , full of loaded pauses and oblique references that should come with big glowing asterisks noting "" pay attention , this will be important later . "" sub-plots and character developments are so fraught with significance -- carter and vinnie slipping casually into one another's lives ; a horse that's not what he appears to be -- you can see the author nodding to himself at the cleverness of it all . even the actors generally look like they're playing to the rafters , with nick nolte all a-growl as the seedy vinnie and albert finney telegraphing his character's unambiguous ambiguity ( only catherine keener , as a vaguely simple-minded woman unwitting involved in the story , shows a welcome subtlety ) . by the time sharon stone blows into the film from some community theater tennessee williams production to play carter's wife , it seems almost impossible that all this is transpiring on a movie screen instead of live and in person . it should go without saying that striving for thematic depth and complexity is not exclusive to the live theater , nor is a labyrinthine plot unworkable on screen . there's simply a quality to simpatico that makes it feel grossly artificial as a film experience . it's easy to watch the film and understand what would make this story a slick , atmospheric character study as a play . as a film , however , it's inert , moving along so deliberately you may begin to feel that you're watching a staged reading committed to film . i don't know if someone could take shepard's play and make it a workable film , but i know this one isn't it . simpatico may make you want to go out and see it as a stage production . . . unless , by the conclusion , you feel that you already have . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1187,"the pelican brief has a lot in common with this summer's the firm . both were directed by "" prestige "" directors , and both were constructed from the "" slicker is better "" model of thriller-making . in short , the pelican brief might as well * be * the firm : an overlong , over-plotted , instantly forgettable entertainment sporadically enlivened by decent supporting performances . unfortunately , it doesn't have gene hackman . technically , the pelican brief is just fine . james horner's score works well , even if it does depend overmuch on dissonant piano chords and wood block percussion . the problem with the pelican brief , the movie , is the same thing that's wrong with the pelican brief , the book : there's not a single interesting or original thing happening , either from a story or character perspective . the big conspiracy at the heart of the story is both insipid and insulting to one's intelligence . it's impossible to accept that no one considered the possibility of spacing out the assassinations , or being slightly more creative than putting a bullet in the head of a man who was on a respirator . there's only one possible reason for such stupidity : there wouldn't have been anything for a clever law student to sniff out . grisham's story is loaded with implausibilities and the payoff it offers for accepting them is simply not worth it . the characters in pakula's adaptation don't fare much better . there is not a shred of back story , nothing to suggest why she pursues the assassination story , nothing to make her anything but a positively bland lady in distress . to her credit , roberts' reaction to an explosion is gripping , and she's thoroughly convincing at suggesting dazed trauma , but dazed and traumatized is about as fara as this role goes . denzel washington , one of the most talented and charismatic leading men around , has an equally blank slate with gray grantham ; somehow he manages to act circles around a part where there's really nothing there . only hume cronyn , in a single scene as the aging justice rosenberg , has any spark . no one else has a thing to work with . the firm was no piece of art , but at least its characters were reasonably fleshed out for the screen . the pelican brief asked me to sit through nearly two and a half hours of repetitive chases involving people i didn't care about . a third grisham adaptation , the client , is on its way next year . i suppose it's too much to ask that he's learned to write an interesting story by now .

"" in arlington road , however , you _could_ have seen it coming . the twist _was_ the story , brilliantly re-casting the entire film as a retrospective experience . scream 3 twisted because it had to , and you got the sense that any one of a dozen possible endings would have seemed just as plausible . once again , i did not out-guess kruger . and , as with scream 3 , it didn't really matter . admittedly , it's sort of a nifty premise . the road to much cinematic garbage has also been littered with nifty premises . reindeer games may not be garbage , but there's also nothing that builds a sense of identification with the film's ostensible hero . affleck is a pleasant enough performer , and he's certainly built like an action star , but there's something he lacks as a screen actor . despite the fact that most of his roles to date have required him to lose his temper , there never seems to be an edge to affleck's performances . any attempts the film makes to dig into who rudy is , or why he does what he does , feel pointless . as the film's central character , affleck is just occupying space . of course , genre films like reindeer games often don't ask more of its characters . he's got a great director for that kind of work in john frankenheimer , who knows how to make the most of dialogue-free mayhem . he's got a top-notch villain in gary sinise ( though you could argue that his characterization doesn't make much sense once all the pieces of the plot fall into place ) . and he's got charlize theron , who's as easy on the eyes as anyone working in film ( and , if i'm any judge , destined to be considered like michelle pfeiffer as an extremely talented actress once people can get past how breathtakingly gorgeous she is ) . the casino heist itself is appropriately frantic , and plenty of kruger's small script moments along the way are slick enough to keep a viewer interested . then come the double-crosses , triple-crosses and quadruple-crosses so fast and so frequent that another one is upon you before you can remember the prefix for the next "" -uple "" you're up to . there's no question that the events in the final half-hour of reindeer games prove surprising , in the sense that the average viewer probably won't expect them . it's also true that they don't matter in the slightest except as a sort of false cleverness . not only are they arbitrary -- i dare anyone to watch the film a second time and spot a single clue that points in the right direction -- but they're insulting in a film that then goes on to make the denouement an act of supreme stupidity ( hint : try not to leave a trail to your whereabouts if you're leaving the scene of a crime ) . for a simple genre story , reindeer games ties itself up in far too many unnecessary knots . kruger has shown himself to be smarter than your average screenwriter . he has also shown that he can be too interested in proving it . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1189,"screenplay : wim wenders , ulrich zieger & richard reitiger . director : wim wenders . wim wenders' wings of desire was one of my favorite films of 1988 . as corny as it might sound , i found it to be one of those rare transcendental film experiences , a beautiful and poetic tale of love and human wonder that left me feeling uplifted . i was unsure of how to approach the idea that wenders was making a sequel to this singular film , but i crossed my fingers and hoped for the best . unfortunately , all the good will in the world was unable to salvage faraway , so close ! wenders seems to have been unclear as to what made wings of desire special , weighing down a simple story with self-importance and a ridiculously convoluted plot . faraway , so close ! cassiel resolves to use his physical form to intervene for good where he was unable to do so before , but that resolution proves easier said than done . like wings of desire , faraway , so close ! shows us the angels' world in black and white , and opens with loosely connected scenes of the angels smiling knowingly over human shoulders as they work and worry . but unless my memory fails me , those scenes go on far longer in faraway , and they become extremely tedious . this prologue seemed to go on and on , and while it did provide information necessary later in the story , it could have been done much more efficiently . there are too many characters , many of whom are completely irrelevant to the story . the film's second act is by far its most effective . the marvelously expressive sander is great during these scenes , drifting into drunken despondency with genuine pain . wanders through the film making ominous but opaque statements like , "" time is the absence of money , "" becomes thoroughly oppressive in the final half hour . faraway , so close ! peter falk , who was so good in wings of desire as damiel's guide to humanity , is simply comic relief here , although a scene involving the distraction of two security guards is very funny . wings of desire was whimsical , but never dopey , and faraway has a real problem finding its tone . perhaps the most egregious sin in faraway is a preachy epilogue that seems only tangentially connected to the film we just spent two and a half hours watching . wings of desire was a kind of message film , but the message was skillfully delivered ; in the intervening five years , wenders seems to have had all the subtlety sucked out of him . the moments that do work in faraway , so close ! are mired in overplotting , and there's never any flow to the story . what's worse , it has tainted my memories of wings of desire . i think i need to rent it tonight .

1190,"filmed and directed by dan geller and dayna goldfine . none so chose . unfortunately , it's not particularly successful . frosh captures moments , but due to its overly large canvas it doesn't capture enough growth . cheng , a first generation chinese-american , quips about stanford's liberal bias while coping with academic difficulties . i should preface my comments by stating that i spent three years , in various capacities , living in freshman dorms at stanford . i wasn't expecting to see anything i'd never seen before ; what i was expecting was a film that highlighted real growing experiences , and allowed viewers to watch the first tentative steps of kids into adulthood . a few such moments in frosh work extremely well , particularly shayne's emotional discussion with a few friends about why she's considering leaving the catholic church . but there aren't enough of these moments . frosh seems more interested in being a kind of rapidly edited video yearbook , and like most yearbooks it's only going to be really significant to those who lived the moments . part of the problem with frosh is that even the nine-student focus is too large . frosh will uncover an issue in one of their lives , but doesn't take the time to show us the resolution . we never learn , for example , if at the end of the year shayne is still a church-going catholic ; we never learn how cheng recovers from his disappointing first-quarter grades . when it's all said and done , frosh comes off as an interesting anthropological footnote , but not a particularly deep or insightful look at why the freshman year at a residential university is so significant . my primary bone of contention is that in its attempt to keep its brow relatively high , frosh almost completely ignores two of the most challenging issues of the freshman year : romantic relationships and substance use . there is one look at a blind date , but little more . perhaps out of fear of scaring off their subjects , geller and goldfine have excised most material parents wouldn't want to know . in one scene , a professor tells debbie as she attempts to describe a term paper topic , "" you're babbling "" ; in another , one dormmate asks shayne , "" if there was no , like , racism or sexism , what would you talk about ? "" where it comes up short is as an examination of how much an individual can change in these nine pivotal months . trust me . . . i was there . "

[warning : elements of this review may be considered spoilers . proceed at your own risk . ] on the off chance that the rest of the film hadn't already irritated you or bored you to distraction -- and trust me , it will do one or the other -- keith gordon's waking the dead offers a special treat during its climactic scene . the wrongness of that setting may not strike you immediately , until you consider the context . without any identification . any guesses as to whether a real , living person would have pulled off that tidy little stunt ? it's a truly logic-numbing moment , but it's indicative of why waking the dead is such a catatonic failure . gordon lays on the brooding score , the lingering close-ups and the ominous fades-to-white , apparently intent on creating a phil spector-like wall of despair . as a tone piece , it's beyond reproach ; if you don't clue in to how waking the dead is supposed to make you feel , you've probably fallen asleep . not that anyone could blame you . waking the dead may do a splendid job of manufacturing gloom , but it's incapable of giving you any reason to care about its characters . crudup and connelly are steady , competent actors , but there's nothing they can do to make the relationship between fielding and sarah as transcendently life-changing as we must believe it was . in fact , gordon shows almost no understanding for how to play his most critical emotional moments . gordon's litany of miscalculations adds up to a film that clearly wasn't constructed to build characters . every supporting character is an afterthought -- wasting janet mcteer , as fielding's sister , should warrant some sort of fine -- but that doesn't explain why even the main characters are afterthoughts . in an ironic late piece of dialogue , sarah warns fielding to view her as a complete person , "" not an image , not an idea .

1194,"sometimes you can learn a lot about a film from its ad campaign . the television spots for romeo is bleeding featured a high energy , rapid-edit montage which made the film look like an all-out action thriller ; the print ads , on the other hand , featured stylized renderings of the stars in a scene out of a 50's crime comic , with critical blurbs in word balloons . and that about sums up what's wrong with romeo is bleeding . there's a fair amount of style and black-humored mayhem , but underneath it is a film that really doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be a noir thriller or a parody of a noir thriller , and a script that is an absolute mess . stylistically , romeo is bleeding seems to be on the right track . the lighting is evocative , the air is usually thick with cigarette smoke , and trumpets and saxophones wail plaintively in the background . a running voice-over narrative by jack , told in retrospect and in the third person , achieves the right raymond chandler-esque tone of impending doom . the stage is set to have some fun with film noir conventions--the dumb blonde girlfriend , the urbane mob boss--but that's not what happens . what does happen is that medak and screenwriter hilary henkin decide to serve up a freaked-out combination of 1940s and 1990s crime film sensibilities , sort of a "" what if quentin tarantino and abel ferrara collaborated on a phillip marlowe adaptation . "" consequently , the tone of romeo is bleeding is radically uneven , with moody conversations slamming into blood-spattered confrontations , and characterizations which don't make a shred of sense . the only logic in romeo is bleeding is the logic of excess , as the filmmakers abandon all pretense of telling a story in the name of the outrageous . structurally , the script for romeo is bleeding is a disaster . jack is developed in a careless , haphazzard manner that left me without any concern for what happened to him . finally , romeo is bleeding commits perhaps its most unpardonable sin with a final showdown between jack and mona which was so anti-climactic that i groaned out loud . at times , the film seems to have been improvised , as though in the middle of shooting someone would periodically say , "" hey , wouldn't it be cool to do this ? "" romeo is bleeding looks good , occasionally very good , and olin's performance is entertaining , but the film also appears to have been edited with a knife and fork , and amounts to little more than a series of loosely connected scenes with shock value .

1198,"screenplay : lowell ganz and babaloo mandel . i prefer my comedy with an edge . the war of the roses , ruthless people , and tv's "" the simpsons "" show that sometimes nothing is funnier than human nature at its nastiest . it is also the case that few comedy conventions irritate me more than starting with an edge and progressively dulling it with warm-fuzziness . so here comes greedy , a promising enough comedy about avaricious relatives , but that fact that it was written by the popular team of lowell ganz and babaloo mandel ( splash , parenthood , city slickers ) should have clued me in that it wouldn't go for the jugular . there are fewer big laughs than in any of those films , as a largely uninteresting cast tries gamely to support a limp story . when it did work , greedy let its nasty characters be their nastiest . unfortunately , none of the laughs are as big as they could have been , and that's primarily because ganz and mandel don't provide their characters with distinct personalities , except for siobhan fallon's horrendously overboard drunk as hartman's wife . they're all sort of interchangeably grasping , and hartman , begley and burns don't have enough manic energy on their own . while several of the lines are funny , none of the characters is funny enough to give them a big push . after that early scene , greedy loses almost all of the bite it might have had . either director jonathan lynn or fox himself wouldn't completely allow danny to get nasty . greedy wimps out when it should be emphasizing lust for money is damaging its characters . a simpler and more relevant criticism of greedy is that it really doesn't do anything new . greedy relatives and fights for an inheritance are film staples , and most previous attempts have handled the subject better . greedy does offer a few giggles , but they get buried under a fairly self-evident message and a slow , unoriginal story . greedy is like a bottle of acid diluted in far too much water : it's just not corrosive enough .

1199,"screenplay : todd phillips and scot armstrong . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , sexual situations , adult humor , profanity ) running time : 92 minutes . it is part of a grand tradition of leering , sniggering comedies in which the anti-social behavior and hormone-fueled idiocy of 18-year-olds ( portrayed by 25-year-olds ) are celebrated for the entertainment of 15-year-olds . but i remember a time when such tales were sublimely crude ( animal house ) rather than ridiculously crude ( american pie ) , when the goal was celebrating an anarchic spirit rather than seeing how much bodily fluid you could get away with in an r-rated film . pushing the envelope , farrelly brothers-style , can be fun ; stuffing the envelope to the point that it requires hundreds of dollars in postage can become a simple , wearying exercise in "" can we get away with this ? "" if you belong to that demographic that finds a joke most appealing when it's accompanied by a groan of disgust , have we got a treat for you . i believe it should go without saying that the quartet takes a few detours before reaching texas . most of those detours involve the sacred duo of collegiate intemperance : mood-altering substances and sex . only it's just not all that funny . unlike the pointlessly message-mongering american pie , road trip never pretends to be anything more than a cesspool of moral depravity . it's even refreshing in a twisted way that the girl who seduces josh -- inspiring the cross-country recovery mission in the first place -- actually becomes the film's heroine , daring to suggest that sexually aggressive women can also be nice people . but road trip's singularity of purpose doesn't translate into much manic energy . its low-brow set pieces are pitched at obvious incongruities : the pairing of rail-thin kyle with his substantial ladyfriend , an old man sporting an obvious erection , the macho e . l . there's not much of a sense of comic discovery to road trip's gags ; they're the gags teenagers are expected to laugh at . deserved kudos do go to tom green , the mtv variety show host-cum-circus geek who plays the demented barry . green's act can be off-putting , but he's surprisingly funny as the perpetual undergrad with an unhealthy obsession with rubin's pet python ( "" unleash the fury "" has already become part of my film-based lexicon ) . his scenes are some of the only moments in road trip where you can't be sure exactly what's going to happen next . the rest of this trip meanders through some extremely familiar countryside , and not familiar in a way that inspires fond comparisons to classic genre cousins . road trip is comedy a level removed from anything that could be really funny , because it's all about how funny the mere idea of a profane , stoned dog could be . as the real classics of sophomoric humor have proved over the years , even when it comes to gross-outs , execution is everything . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1200,"screenplay : scott rosenberg . producers : jerry bruckheimer and mike stenson . director : dominic sena . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , violence , adult themes , brief nudity ) running time : 119 minutes . in an ever-changing world , there's something understandably comforting about the impressive sameness of jerry bruckheimer productions . there's a formula to his films that has rarely let him down , a formula that continues with nary a whiff of change in gone in sixty seconds . since this is a bruckheimer film , you know you can count on . . . 1 ) a premise ready-made for action . 2 ) a style that transcends individual directors . it doesn't matter whether bruckheimer's flavor of the month is tony scott , michael bay , simon west or sixty seconds' helmer dominic sena -- his films all seem to look and sound exactly the same . perhaps it's the fact that bruckheimer is attracted to directors whose background ( like his ) is in commercials and music videos , making them likely to concur with his vision of glossy packaging . maybe he gets his people such great deals on orange lens filters that it's impossible for those directors not to employ them for every single shot . whatever the reason , the quick-cuts , bombastic musical scoring and burnished glow give bruckheimer films that certain grandiose flash that makes for action gold , even if nothing else makes much sense because of in his recent efforts , bruckheimer has shown a distinct inability to strip down an action story to its essentials . gone in sixty seconds is no exception , dragging the pacing down by cramming too many characters into the narrative . that can result in absurd decisions like creating a solid , vicious villain in eccleston , then having his character disappear for literally 80 minutes of the running time , or similarly wasting the forceful presence of vinnie jones ( as memphis' mute , muscular associate ) . it also results in conflicts constructed with a faux-operatic sense of consequence . the family tension between memphis and kip , the non-sparks between memphis and his old flame/running partner sway ( angelina jolie ) , even the history between memphis and lindo's determined detective bog the film down with a ridiculous sense that the story should be taken seriously , when it should be a quick and dirty piece of crowd-pleasing nonsense . those decisions are complicated , for better and worse , by . . . 4 ) provocative casting . cage and duvall are both back for gone in sixty seconds , as is the characteristically diverse bruckheimer supporting cast . somehow , it does make many of bruckheimer's films feel less awful than they should that there are fairly talented actors involved ( cage's descent into genre nonchalance notwithstanding ) . it also seems even more pathetic when they are stuck with scott rosenberg dialogue like "" he's bad he's real bad . "" or , "" i'm not into the life any more . "" of course , plenty of viewers will still lap it all up because it all comes coated in . . . eventually , bruckheimer films do move , albeit with a carefully constructed familiarity . the climactic car chase in sixty seconds is a competent piece of film work , accentuated by sena's fetishistic cross-cutting to brakes and clutches , and a car jump as aggressively improbable as anything since speed . it's simply obvious that the whole film was constructed around that chase , making me wish the film-makers could be more honest about their intentions instead of lobbing a dozen pointless sub-plots at us . those who have enjoyed most of bruckheimer's previous films aren't likely to look disdainfully at this one , because it goes nowhere different . it's just another over-blown , sporadically diverting celebration of guy stuff . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1201,"if there has been one theme one can identify running through the work of director barry levinson , it is the search for the american dream . jimmy hollywood is another such story , but it is lacking something previous levinson projects had , namely a firm grasp on what the protagonsists' dreams were . there are interesting ideas in the script , and some of the dry humor characteristic of levinson's dialogue , but it's never all that compelling because the character of jimmy alto is too schizophrenic , and with him the tone of the whole film . one is about the thankless life of being a struggling actor , including the cattle calls , waiting tables and shameless self-promotion necessary to make it . it is typical of levinson to make his heroes' motives less than completely pure , but in this instance they're simply muddled . it is difficult to care all that much about jimmy , and it's difficult to figure out whether levinson wants us to focus on his characters or the setting . it is also a simple truth that jimmy hollywood was a hard film for me to like . while it has its humorous moments , it's too grim to be a purely entertaining comedy , and it doesn't explore its dark themes deeply enough to be an insightful drama . its two principal characters are frequently more pathetic than they are sympathetic , the pacing is extremely deliberate , and the shifts in tone had me shifting in my seat a lot . when i did find interesting elements , it was more a case of detatched admiration than enjoyment . among the objects of admiration were two performances , neither of them joe pesci's . his co-stars , however , are quite good . the big surprise is a funny and affecting christian slater , whose forgetful william does the low-key performance in untamed heart one better . slater is developing into a complete actor , and his performance here is extremely interesting . yet perhaps "" interesting "" is the faint praise with which i ultimately damn jimmy hollywood . i found a number of things in the film interesting . i just found none of them truly engaging .

1202,"screenplay : ben edlund and john august and joss whedon . mpaa rating : pg ( adult themes , violence ) running time : 93 minutes . why exactly do the drej fear humanity ? he is supposed to be deeply embittered by feelings of abandonment , but why are we supposed to understand that when damon's vocal performance never suggests anything more than mild annoyance ? titan a . e . is a stunningly crafted piece of film animation . it is also inexcusably lazy and dramatically inept , and there is no earthly or after-earthly reason why that had to be the case . director don bluth has made fine animated films like an american tail , the land before time and anastasia , which would be reason enough to hope for the best . but look at the talent credited with this script : ben edlund created the wonderfully satirical comic book "" the tick ; "" john august wrote the propulsively clever go ; joss whedon co-scripted toy story , and created "" buffy the vampire slayer . "" put those three writers together , and the law of averages would almost demand something smart , unconventional and utterly original . instead , they pasted together a story so blatantly cribbed from so many different sources that it would be an endless and thankless task to list them all ( star wars , star trek 2 and battlestar galactica are only the most obvious ) . that's not an uncommon problem with films of this genre ; after all , there are certain buttons one is expected to push , and certain hero-on-a-quest motifs one is obliged to include . that doesn't excuse creating a thoroughly unappealing protagonist , introducing an evil alien race whose motivations never make any sense , or filling the script with dialogue that could have come from a random cliche generator . not a single line stuck in my head within minutes of leaving the theater ; not a single character relationship was explored with any care . of course , it doesn't help that virtually every voice performance in titan a . e . feels as though it were completed while the actor involved was preoccupied with some other mundane task , like making dinner reservations , or trying to get out of traffic . damon's lackluster work is most evident , but pullman and barrymore certainly give him a run for his money ; even janeane garofalo and nathan lane are wasted . only john leguizamo , as a high-strung scientist/navigator on korso's ship , seems at all interested in creating a character , and he does so primarily by talking really fast in a squeaky voice . there isn't a single moment in titan a . e . when a performance feels directed . bluth and co-director gary goldman appear to have felt the actors had done their job if they read their lines without stuttering . there's no question that titan a . e . is visually striking , and that the action sequences are well-paced . there are two stunning flights of fantasy in particular that briefly give the film a vivid sense of place : a planet with a sea covered in plants that bloom as hovering balls of hydrogen , and a nebula filled with massive reflective ice crystals . both effects are computer generated , and the mix of conventional animation and cgi elements continues to push the boundaries of the form . but titan a . e . can't survive on its dazzle ; it's too grim and mirthless to hold anyone's interest as pure fantasy . this is one long , long 90 minute wait for us to see whether cale and his cohorts can save humanity . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"" before scary movie's release , several critics wondered aloud how it could satirize a film that was itself a satire of other films . the premise wasn't entirely accurate , since scream was always a horror film itself , albeit a deconstruction of horror films within the genre . scary movie's problem isn't that it tries to do things scream already did better , but that it's not funny enough often enough . perhaps if more of the humor had hovered around the margins ( like the labels on a restroom condom machine ) instead of over-staying its welcome ( like the fate of a talkative movie theater patron ) , scary movie could have felt less like a marketing hook in search of some actual comedy . it doesn't take much creativity or wit to nudge an audience with pop culture references . it just takes naming your film something obvious like scream if you know what i did last halloween . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1206,"while watching loser , it occurred to me that amy heckerling's true genius as a film-maker is casting . she seems to understand instinctively how to find performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws . giving appealing actors an appealing script creates likeable movies . giving appealing actors a script in which their appeal _is_ the movie makes for unexpectedly awful films like loser . naturally , heckerling makes her protagonist an all-around swell guy . i must confess that , for a while , i was suckered in by heckerling's casting . jason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him even easier to embrace ; suvari is a coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence . they're pleasant enough to watch , and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are and how nice their respective antagonists aren't . then it gradually becomes clear that there's virtually nothing to loser but scenes of that sort . in theory , loser is a romantic comedy , but there is scarcely a laugh to be found in the entire film ( notable exception : a cameo by a scene-stealing comic actor as a video store clerk ) . instead of taking any time to make the characters' situations funny , heckerling spends 98 minutes making her characters' situations pathetic . she shows none of the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked clueless , nor any of that film's interest in lively plotting ( not surprisingly , since clueless's plot came via jane austen's emma ) . she simply turns the film into a pity party . since loser is a film composed almost entirely of establishing character , you might think that those characters would be interesting , or at least slightly complicated . instead , you have people either so perfect or so unredeemable that there's no reason to watch them . paul isn't just a nice guy , he's flawless ; consequently , he's a central character who does absolutely no growing . dora's unthinking devotion to alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty to be found in loser , and even that isn't explored in sufficient detail . there's more ambiguity in the 30-second snippet from alan cumming's broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret then there is in the rest of loser it's one thing to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations ; it's another to flatten your leads into easily digestible mush . and it would help if those comic exaggerations were somehow . . . i don't know . . . comic . still , i spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that heckerling would somehow salvage loser from its tedium and justify my desire to like paul and dora . instead of giving the sequence a knowing wink-a reference to the graduate , a hint that paul is becoming an overly-sensitive clich-heckerling plays it deadly straight . clueless's cher had her self-absorption and manipulative tendencies to balance her cuteness . loser may be a crashing bore , but gee , aren't those two kids swell ? see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"" whatever the specific points of disagreement might have been , it would appear that ellis knew something that rich did not . it is clear that the inkwell could have been a gentle look at a rarely- seen side of the black american experience ; instead , it's a sloppy and ham-fisted collection of caricatures which seems to trip over an occasional truth rather than aiming for any . at times , i thought i might end up liking the inkwell . there was a relaxed , nostalgic tone to some of the scenes featuring drew , and larenz tate brought a geeky , confused charm to drew's fumblings through adolescence . but for every scene which endeared , there were two which annoyed . the inkwell tempts you with sweetness , then smacks you over the head every time you try to embrace it . it's also exceedingly hard to take the inkwell at all seriously with so many characters so miserably realized . glynn turman huffs and puffs as the unashamedly republican uncle spencer , delivering one of those horrible drunken diatribes that only movie drunks deliver . and that's really the fundamental problem with the inkwell . since i knew exactly where it was going , its only chance to work for me was in how it took me there . i wanted to be interested in drew's story , but i was repeatedly drawn away by the seemingly pointless class struggle between kenny and spencer ; i wanted to lose myself in the characters , and they repeatedly reminded me they were phony . time and again , i found myself convinced that matty rich had no real sense of what he wanted to do with this story , so he did a little bit of everything . and somewhere , trey ellis must be having the last laugh .

1209,"screenplay : vince mckewin . director : howard deutch . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 116 minutes . if the theme of the replacements -- and i use the word "" theme "" so loosely that it may fall off at any moment -- is that certain overpaid entertainers have grown complacent and lazy and that audiences prefer seeing genuine effort , there's more than a teensy bit of irony in it . bad news bears-style comedies have been the preferred brand of sports film since . . . well , since the bad news bears . a lovable loser/band of lovable losers eventually rallies around his/her/its underdog status and surmounts impossible odds to emerge victorious -- what tale could be more fundamentally american ? of course , the "" work ethic "" is supposed to be fundamentally american , too , but you'd never know it from the sort of sleepwalking screenwriting in the replacements . three guesses whether they make it , and the first two don't count , but never mind that . never mind too that the replacements doesn't exactly treat the labor dispute with any complexity ( owners and striking players bad , cheerleaders and replacement players good ) . movies like the replacements have always been about the hijinks of the players , both on and off the field ; the predictability of the formula has been part of its appeal . there are a some fun characterizations -- jon favreau as an unhinged swat cop-turned-middle linebacker , rhys ifans as chain-smoking welsh soccer player-turned-placekicker nigel -- and some amusing confrontations with the striking players . the losers get better , the bad guys get their comeuppance , there are some decent chuckles along the way , everyone applauds . no muss , no fuss . and no common sense . for a fairly simple comedy , the replacements is full of baffling plot points . why was it necessary to bring in the vaguely blackballed mcginty to lead the replacement team ? why does a team that has been practicing together for less than a week appear to be running complicated passing plays on every down ? even ignoring the most obvious question of all -- why cast keanu reeves as the lead in a comedy -- the replacements appears to have been constructed with no thought but getting to the big ending , when everyone can applaud for the triumphant underdog . what it comes down to , really , is laziness . veteran hack comedy director howard deutch ( grumpier old men , the odd couple ii ) is a button-pusher , knowing how to get the most obvious laughs out of the most obvious situations at the most obvious times . it doesn't take a tactical gridiron genius to realize that the makers of the replacements just don't care . the concept is pre-sold , the fans are in the seats , and the overpaid entertainers couldn't care less about giving their all for the people ultimately paying their salaries . is anyone interested in making a movie about replacement film-makers ? see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1210,"screenplay : john waters . director : john waters . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 88 minutes . there is something so petulant and defensive about the tone of cecil b . demented that it's almost enough to make you cry for john waters . he made the movies he wanted to make , and damn the sensibilities of anyone else . but times have changed since waters' early '70s heyday . independent film-making came into its own , and while "" mainstream "" comedy has grown more gratuitously daring in recent years , waters has drifted to the ideological center with campy-yet-tame movies like cry-baby , hairspray and serial mom . in cecil b . demented , waters seems engaged in a desperate attempt to be recognized for his edge once again . he'd show us where his sympathies were ; he'd give it to mainstream hollywood big time . this is what it has come to for the man who introduced coprophagy into the contemporary cinema : crafting a toothless , uninspired satire of hollywood , and using melanie griffith to do it . griffith stars as honey whitlock , a raging bitch of an a-list hollywood actress appearing at a fund-raiser premiere in baltimore for her latest mediocrity . it will be shot in actual theaters and movie sets , recording actual acts of anti-hollywood terrorism . subtlety has never exactly been john waters' strongest suit as a film-maker , so it may be unfair to expect anything different from cecil . nevertheless , it's wearying to sit through a satire that takes such broad , trite shots at its target . waters aims for guffaws from such predictable subjects as the cost of theater concessions , patch adams : the director's cut and unnecessary sequels , then gets even more insider by railing against fines for film set transgressions . even when it seems like he's preparing to let loose with his gloriously bad taste -- a scene in a porn theater where onanistic patrons appear on the verge of defending cecil and company from pursuers with a hail of bodily fluids -- waters backs off to something silly and subdued . cecil's 88 minute , non-stop assault on the obvious may not include a single honest belly laugh . and the sad part is , there are a couple of decent ideas floating around here . griffith's honey isn't really a character -- waters probably hasn't written a real character in his life -- but the charge she gets out of the underground cachet of working with cecil could have made for some sharp jabs at other big-time actors who work on low-budget projects . waters also comes up with an insightful line when cecil notes that there's nowhere for renegade film-makers to go but to the extreme after hollywood has co-opted sex and violence . in neither case does waters take the idea anywhere interesting . griffith's performance is high camp in the grand waters tradition , but there's nothing funny or clever about the way her conversion to cecil's way of thinking is handled . and for an ambush , pseudo-snuff production , cecil's film itself doesn't demonstrate nearly enough creativity or outrage . the way waters approaches his protagonist and his dream project ultimately doom cecil as much as its limp humor . it's certainly clear that waters disdains the vapid product shoveled into american theaters , a sentiment in which he has plenty of company . but it also appears that he has no concern for whether or not cecil's film is going to be any good ; to waters , the simple act of fighting the movie establishment power is enough to make him a hero . it may have been true 25 years ago that a film could be exhilarating just because its creator was daring and thrifty . today , it helps if the film itself is more than an exercise in self-indulgence . the bitter irony is that he's made something just as disposable as patch adams : the director's cut . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1211,"dr . t & the women kicks off with one of those trademarked robert altman sequences of choreographed cacophany . it's a brilliantly economical way to set up a potentially fascinating protagonist . dr . t loves women so much ( in a purely spiritual , madonna-half of the whole madonna/whore thing sort of way ) that he just can't say no to any of them . what a great character to study : a man who idealizes women in a cultural setting -- upper-class southerners -- where plenty of the women are just fine with being idealized . t & the women from being a provocative movie experience : richard gere , and just about everything else . this act one diagnosis underlines every action dr . t makes for the viewer's benefit : ah , note is instinctively sexist-gallant attempts to do everything for bree ! you'd think it might underline things a bit for dr . t himself , especially since he gets the dialogue explaining his wife's condition . gere has never been one of our more subtle actors , but here he simply refuses to give dr . t's pathological sanctification of women any edge . altman and rapp let him off the hook by implicitly suggesting he's just a man tossed about by the forces of estrogen rathern than an example of a particularly unhealthy attitude . and it doesn't help that almost every one of the film's dozen or so female characters is written as a cartoon -- dern as the champagne-swilling , unhappily married belle ; janine turner as a pushy hypochondriac ; tara reid as dr . t's conspiracy buff younger daughter -- making it even easier to see the befuddled dr . t as the victim rather than part of the problem . instead , it's a cheap opportunity to make him almost absurdly sensitive and understanding , when understanding is so clearly what he lacks . t & the women flirts with the kind of symbolism and narrative complexity that can make it seem deep -- be sure to bring an abacus to count the number of connections between water and female sexuality -- but it's actually terribly shallow where it counts . without an actor willing to make dr . t a sexist anachronism in need of some self-awareness , the film is reduced to a two-hour exhibition of limp farce . how depressing to see that wonderfully evocative waiting room turned into the place where the big payoff is someone getting tripped and banging her head on a coffee table . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1212,"screenplay : john hughes . director : patrick read johnson . just as a little role playing exercise , pretend you're john hughes . the home alone films have grossed somewhere in the neighborhood of a gazillion dollars , and you're not convinced that particular cow has been fully milked . unfortunately , macaulay culkin has crossed the line from adorable moppet to gawky adolescent , and last year's variation on the theme , dennis the menace , didn't do well enough to warrant a sequel . so what do you do ? apparently , you write and produce baby's day out , yet another kiddie-pleaser featuring copious cartoon mayhem directed at bad guys . strangely , though , there is a modicum of originality present , thanks to imaginative visual effects and the charmed wanderings of baby bink . for anyone who has seen either home alone or its carbon copy sequel , there is very little new to be found in baby's day out . mantegna appears embarrassed much of the time , making his slow burn look like a plea for sympathy from the audience . still , there are only so many ways that the male genitalia can be mangled before intense boredom sets in . i heard gales of laughter from kids in my audience at such mid-section humor , but i think they would have responded the same to a 90 minute loop of kicks to the groin . what is most annoying about films like baby's day out is that they pretend to have an emotional message . but baby's day out is no more about good parenting than speed is about traffic safety . hughes and johnson make no attempt to follow up these token gestures with any closure ; it's just typical hughesian troweled-on emotion to make the violence more palatable . if there is one reason for anyone of driving age to sit through baby's day out , it is to see the clever special effects which allow bink to survive every adventure with nary a smudge of dirt to tell the tale . these are fun moments , made all the more appealing by the adorable wortons as bink . naturally , hughes ends baby's day out with a teaser for a sequel . but enough is enough , john . the wortons are probably two by now ; that doesn't mean you can squeeze four more films out of them .

1213,"screenplay : joe batteer & john rice . director : stephen hopkins . sometimes , timing is everything . this year , costner is on the other end , as his wyatt earp was beaten into theaters * and * onto video by tombstone . speed's greatest asset was that it never took itself seriously ; blown away , on the other hand , takes itself far too seriously . though there are some nice moments of suspense , blown away sputters out in puddles of melodrama . there's no better way to describe the key problem with blown away than to say that it's overblown but underdeveloped . everything in the screenplay by joe batteer and john rice feels forced and artificial . nothing exemplifies this more than the attempt to ladle on the irish atmosphere . the characters in blown away speak in heavy brogues , drink guinness , dance jigs , even listen to us . . . everything , practically , but say "" faith an' begorrah . "" fine , they're irish already ; they're just not real . and the same is true of the big emotional breakdowns , and the slow motion build-ups to the explosions , and the length of nearly every scene . blown away simply never clicks because , like gaerity's bombs , everything is far more convoluted than it needs to be functionally . meanwhile , two of the most talented actors in america are stuck with underwritten characters and ineffectual direction . he brings no energy and none of the intelligence he usually brings to his roles . tommy lee jones doesn't fare much better , as there is never any clear sense of gaerity's motivation or state of mind . he's just plain weird , bouncing on beds and making bizarre videotapes , but for all his supposed cock-eyed creativity he never comes off as smart enough to be genuinely threatening . when two actors like bridges and jones go wrong , it's difficult not to point the finger of blame at a director who wasn't doing his job . though he fails his actors , stephen hopkins has other things working . he manages to create a mounting tension with each subsequent bomb , as we begin to suspect that at any given moment , anything could be a trigger . but the production just isn't lean enough to sustain that energy . watching blown away , i felt that i had had slightly too much to drink : everything seemed a step slow and peter levy's photography seemed slightly out-of-focus . oh , to be sure , there are lots of big explosions in blown away , but the amount of cinematic heat generated could be measured with an oral thermometer .

1214,"having already self-cannibalized the 1961 animated 101 dalmatians in the successful 1996 live-action version , disney had to look for a more creative way to self-cannibalize in the sequel 102 dalmatians . how wonderfully romantic kevin and chloe's relationship must be . . . 102 dalmatians would have had to work hard to be as actively irritating as its john hughes-penned precursor . instead of being actively irritating , this one registers as merely tedious . like the first film , 102 dalmatians is designed primarily as a great big love-fest between the audience members and the on-screen animals . unfortunately , they're almost never asked to do anything more interesting than sit around and look cuddly . lima ( co-director of disney's tarzan , making his first live-action feature ) generally appears content to let the awww appeal of his canine co-stars take the place of action , adventure or humor . you've probably passed the age where 102 dalmatians would appeal to you if you no longer respond to puppies in a movie with a shriek of , "" puppies ! "" that same overwhelming sense of laziness permeates the film from start to finish . it's blessedly true that 102 dalmatians does not feature a single shot of someone getting his genitals electrocuted , or any mayhem that would bump the rating even to a pg . the slapstick is basically harmless stuff involving dogs biting villains in the rear or cruella's henchman/chauffeur ( tim mcinnerny ) injuring and reinjuring his hands . but there really isn't even all that much slapstick . there's a whole lot of exposition , and it doesn't lead up to anything . in a way , up until the final showdown on a bakery assembly line , it's all rather hypnotically pleasant -- no off-putting violence , no real peril , and no personality . there's also the romantic sub-plot involving kevin and chloe , two of the most blandly attractive characters committed to the screen since the last freddie prinze jr . movie . while close does her best to inject some life into the proceedings -- still playing cruella as a drag queen icon rather than a nasty villain -- the protagonists practically vanish into the background . like far too many sequels , this one just lies there limply , practically daring you not to grant it good will based on another movie . it's bad enough to do that when the other movie in question was successful , but lousy . it's even worse when the good will being traded upon comes from a truly classic cinematic moment . not even a clip from lady and the tramp can make 102 dalmatians worth anything more than a snore . and it doesn't help to prove that cute animated dogs are often preferable to cute real-life dogs . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1215,"screenplay : nancy meyers and charles shyer . director : charles shyer . if you're making a list of movie terms you don't hear all that often , "" caper "" has to be right up there . i love trouble is an attempt to resurrect the caper , and you've got to hand it to nancy meyers and charles shyer for trying . they've put two appealing stars with great chemistry in a fast-paced film . they just forgot to give them anything to do . as much as i found myself wanting to enjoy i love trouble , it barely managed to divert me . the problem is that that characterization vanishes after the first fifteen minutes ( easily the film's best fifteen minutes ) . nolte and roberts struggle admirably to generate some kind of life for their characters , but all they can do is flash their thousand watt smiles and hope for the best . and they go farther than they have any right to , purely on the strength of their charm . when they smiled , i frequently smiled right along with them . it sort of makes you wonder what they could have done with a remotely interesting story . the big conspiracy at i love trouble's center is . . . unique , to say the least , but it's fairly tedious stuff . the identity of the villain is apparent from minute one , and i love trouble takes far too long to get into its main plot . in fact , i might go so far as to say that the plot never gets going , nor is it designed to . only there isn't any witty banter . all told , i have to wonder exactly what it is that meyers and shyer did to earn their screenwriting paychecks . their dialogue earns chuckles at best , their sense of pacing is extremely suspect , and their characterizations are wooden . like their baby boom and father of the bride , i love trouble seems designed only to move along affably , without spark or inventiveness of any kind . the fact is , there is nothing truly off-putting about i love trouble . nolte and roberts make an appealing tandem , and roberts' performance in particular is extremely energetic , perhaps her best work to date . but since a movie like i love trouble is inevitable in its outcome--the two reporters * will * end up together--getting there has to be more interesting . without any excitement in the suspense storyline , and with two bland characters contributing to a singularly vanilla romance , i was left watching two beautiful people be beautiful . it just wasn't enough .

1216,"screenplay : rich wilkes . director : michael lehmann . director michael lehmann's 1989 debut has become a cult classic , an acidic satire of contemporary teen culture with a surreal edge , perhaps most famous for launching winona ryder and christian slater on the road to stardom . only a loopy performance by adam sandler and a slightly more energetic final twenty minutes save it from complete disaster . in its appealing trailers , airheads looked like it was going to be a smart comedy about stupid people . consider yourself warned : this is another case where every funny line is in the trailer . the main problem with airheads turns out to be that it's a stupid comedy about people who aren't stupid enough . adam sandler is perfect ; his thick-as-a-brick reading of pip is far and away the best thing about airheads , good for some genuinely inspired comedy . fraser , however , is playing a basically average guy , and buscemi comes off as flat-out intellectual . airheads had the potential for a lot of laughs coming from the reaction of reasonably normal hostages and police to impossibly stupid band members . unfortunately , some of the hostages and most of the police officers are more idiotic than the lone rangers . the result is a bunch of jokes based on lame confrontations between the band members and a militant black d . j . , mckean's fatuous corporate type and each other , consisting almost entirely of third-grade insults focusing on bodily functions and sexual preference . the characters in airheads simply never interact in a way that's remotely interesting or funny . while the character-based comedy fails , airheads might have had a chance if it had actually been about something , if it had had a point of view or and attitude about * anything * . it's not a parody of corporate music , or corporate radio , or heavy metal youth culture , or even other hostage-based movies like dog day afternoon . there are a few clever moments near the end which take shots at the cult of personality surrounding crimes-in-progress ( all too familiar in the wake of the roadside cheering section in the o . j . simpson chase ) , but they come so late that they seem almost incidental . actually , airheads might be viewed cynically as about one very specific thing : selling a tie-in soundtrack album . in a crowd scene near the film's conclusion , there is a glimpse of the michael lehmann of heathers . it's the kind of whacked-out moment that made heathers unique , and there are a couple more like it that briefly give airheads a bit of juice . sadly , they are stretched out over a 90 minute movie .

1217,"screenplay : diane drake . director : norman jewison . oh , and a reference to roman holiday . have i forgotten anything ? it doesn't appear that the makers of only you have . it is packed to bursting with everything that a hollywood romance is supposed to have--except any connection between its stars . as a result , its agonizing cuteness becomes all the more agonizing , and the hole at its center positively gapes . marisa tomei and robert downey jr . end up together ( and please , no one try to tell me that i'm spoiling anything by revealing that fact ) because that's the way it has to end . not because these characters learn anything about each other that would make them want to learn more , and not because they seem right for each other . however , since it's all accompanied by carriage rides and flowers and beautiful italian scenery , it passes for a love story . and that's fairly sad . equally sad is that there is a supporting story to only you which is infinitely more interesting and touching , and might have made for a movie i would truly have enjoyed . "" why ? unfortunately , the story isn't about kathy , and i just didn't care about faith's quest for damon . individually , as performers , i generally like marisa tomei and robert downey jr . both usually appear very natural on screen , and downey in particular shows the potential to be a solid , charming romantic leading man . in only you , however , his lovable rascal is completely one-dimensional , and the script's attempts to justify his behavior don't sell . tomei has it even worse , directed by norman jewison to a teeth-aching level of adorableness , but that's just indicative of how everything in only you is pitched : lay on the syrupy score , emphasize sven nykvist's cinematography , throw in romantic signifiers by the dozen . what it all adds up to is a film so mechanical you can almost hear the gears grinding .

1218,"starring : anthony hopkins , matthew broderick , bridget fonda , john cusack , michael lerner , dana carvey . if you can capture that image in your mind , you will know everything you really need to know about why the road to wellville just doesn't quite work . on the one hand , the sumptuous production is filled with delightful period detail ; on the other hand , there isn't all that much going on that one couldn't find in your typical bad , overlong "" saturday night live "" sketch . somewhere in the road to wellville is a satire of health fads , but it's buried beneath costumes and scatological humor . the result is basically a merchant ivory production of a "" benny hill "" episode . the road to wellville opens promisingly enough , with a funny scene of a group of women undergoing "" laugh therapy . "" it's delightfully silly , but it isn't long before it becomes clear that such silliness is about all there is to the road to wellville . actually , it may be more accurate to think of the road to wellville's one joke in broader terms , as the tittering variations on an r-rated farce . at one time or another , all of the following are used as punch lines : vomit , flatulence , sex , bare breasts , masturbation , erections , enemas , urine and feces . i'm hard pressed to come up with anything they might have missed . it's not that none of the gags are amusing ; some of them are . but over two hours of such material truly tests one's patience . that running time seems particularly long because screenwriter and director alan parker lets his narrative wander all over the place . but there isn't anything interesting going on in that sub-plot , except watching cusack take a lot longer than it takes us to figure out that his partner is a fraud . while they may be meant to humanize kellogg , they're really just one more case of where judicious editing might have benefited the film . as with almost everything in the road to wellville , the acting is almost universally too broad , probably as an attempt to disguise the fact that there may not be a single genuinely interesting character in the bunch . matthew broderick is good in a rare adult role , but he's stuck with every actor's bugaboo , the drunk scene , as is cusack . and carvey , naturally , mugs shamelessly . they are all surrounded by marvelous sets , and are well-photographed by peter biziou , but parker hasn't given them any clear sense of exactly why they are making this movie . for a story that's supposed to be a satire , the road to wellville ends up mostly as a parody of itself .

1219,"starring : elijah wood , kevin costner , mare winningham , lexi randall . screenplay : kathy mcworter . director : jon avnet . if they gave out academy awards for earnestness , the war would have to be one of the front-runners . war , it solemnly intones , is bad ; so are racism and sexism . as a result , some very impressive performances are wasted on a script that just tries far too hard to deliver a very simplistic moral . the problem is that it's in too many places . it's not even enough that elvadine gets to tell off the teacher in a completely over-the-top speech ; lidia has to get her two cents in as well . mcworter appears convinced that wherever one speech is good , two must be even better . the script is overloaded with homilies , and needed a good re-write at least fifteen minutes shorter . one of the goals of that re-write should have been removing the characters of lidia and her friends entirely . the relationship between the simmons siblings is given only a cursory treatment , and the narration lidia provides could just as easily have been provided by stu , or not at all . the war is first and foremost about the relationship between stu and stephen , and there are too many tangents which ignore that relationship . when costner and wood are the focus of attention , the war is actually quite compelling . there is tremendous conflict in their relationship , and both actors do a fine job of bringing it out . sadly , mcworter and director jon avnet are more interested in heavy-handedness than they are in character study , so that by the time the climactic battle for the treehouse rolls around , the point has been made and made and made again . now let me get this straight : war is bad , right ?

1220,"screenplay/director : david mamet . the advertising campaign for oleanna features the line , "" whatever side you take , you're wrong . "" behind that statement is the conceit that this adaptation of david mamet's play , and by extension the original play itself , is a balanced presentation of a controversial issue . it is not . whatever oleanna might be--provocative , infuriating , incendiary--it is not balanced ; it is a technically proficient but inaccessible piece of reactionary agit-prop . there are two fine performances at the center of the film , but it was impossible for me to separate them from mamet's smug attempt to pass this off as thought-provoking theater . those familiar with david mamet's elliptical dialogue will instantly recognize oleanna as his work ; those unfamiliar with it will wonder what the heck he's trying to do . the staccato rhythms don't sound conversational , and in fact sometimes seem even more stagey than conventional stage dialogue . but though the first act of oleanna is occasionally very rough going , there is something compelling about that dialogue . i found myself paying closer attention , and noticing recurring motifs and shifting roles . william h . macy , who originated the role of the professor on broadway , has a gift for making mamet's words sound as close to natural as they can , and gives a haunting and haunted performance . debra eisenstadt is also impressive , alternately cowering and commanding , but the words sound more forced in her mouth . unfortunately , that is symptomatic of what is really wrong with her role . has the professor , by virtue of the power inherent in his position , placed carol in a compromising position , or is carol reacting too much in accord with a pre-determined agenda ? mamet pretends to make a case for both sides , but in reality he has done no such thing . at this point , while carol speaks wearing this insignia on her lapel , nothing that carol says can be taken seriously , even if we are inclined to thing that we may be seeing events through our own prejudiced lenses . issues of politics aside , oleanna just doesn't connect beyond a level of detached technical admiration . perhaps seeing the play live , where post-performance discussions were almost always part of the experience , provided more immediacy , more intensity . on the big screen , for all its controversy , oleanna is just too cold and intellectualized . i think that reaction might inspire mamet to take a good , long look at the messages he is sending .

1221,"screenplay : ronald d . moore and brannon braga . director : david carson . whether or not i would be considered a trekker probably depends on whom you would ask . i have been a fan of both the original series and its recently retired follow-up , as well as the even- numbered entries in the film series . however , i have never been one of those folks who store away trek minutiae and get into debates over the relative merits of spock vs . data . somewhere along the line , the "" star trek "" film series began to seem more and more directed at those in the latter category , and star trek : generations may be the natural conclusion of this direction . its production values may be high , but the writing is frequently appalling , and instead of a script has a collection of references , in-jokes and ill-defined characters . no sooner is it out on its maiden voyage than a distress signal brings them to the nexus , a mysterious ribbon of energy . i don't think it is an insult to fans of "" star trek "" to suggest that to a certain extent , the particulars of a plot are not really the most important elements in a "" trek "" film . but even that interpretation assumes that characterization has to be consistent , and in generations that just doesn't happen . he doesn't get a joke . once the chip is in place , spiner gets to have a lot of fun with data's new emotions , but the point is that he's no longer the data we know . if the rest of the "" next generation "" cast fares any better , it's only because they're on the screen so little that they're simply window dressing . but then again , this story isn't really about the new crew . it's about kirk and picard , the cowboy and the politician , sharing the screen . stewart's edginess is indicative of what may be a very bad sign for paramount's hopes to turn the new cast into the same kind of franchise the original cast was : these are clearly the not ready for big screen players . only thirty years of history can create a moment like that , and that's time this new crew doesn't have . it certainly doesn't help that the plot they are stuck in is so convoluted and badly constructed that you need to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find your way out again . it's also loaded with little gags all aimed at those who are familiar enough with the series to turn to all their friends in a shared nudge of recognition . i wonder whether anyone who is coming in cold to the "" trek "" universe at this point would be anything but baffled and bored by what is going on . and what a waste of malcolm mcdowell , who could have been a great monomanical villain but should have been given a much more compelling reason for his obsession . there are plenty of details both scientific and of continuity to pick at , but to do so would be to ignore generations' major flaws . however , i would like to make one recommendation : seatbelts . no , i think the audience might need them more . this journey is one bumpy ride .

1222,"screenplay : robert king . all right , all right , we get the point : despite all similarities to the best-selling story , speechless is * not * based on the romance between 1992 presidential campaign rivals james carville and mary matalin . in fact , the script was in development well before 1992 . no , it's not that the speechless twosome are speech writers , not campaign managers ; it's that carville and matalin's story is actually interesting . speechless is a limp , poorly structured would-be romantic comedy . the standard formula for a movie like speechless would have the two principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the end that they're crazy about each other . it's a noble attempt to shake things up , but unfortunately it just doesn't work . part of the fun of watching sparring in a romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the characters do , but in speechless they already know they're attracted to each other , and we're left with waiting for the campaign to end so they'll admit that they love each other already . there is such a herky-jerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even king's sharp dialogue can't prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour . inconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis and michael keaton , and with those performances most of their scenes together . the problems begin with their initial courtship , which does virtually nothing to establish julia's character and merely establishes that kevin is a wise-ass . davis is radiantly beautiful , and keaton is generally entertaining , but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter one bit . in a couple of scenes , like a quiet moment sitting at a fountain , they actually achieve some measure of connection . for the most part , however , they're just actors spouting lines . you keep waiting for a little spark , and it never happens . perhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechless's politics . the setting seems perfect for a high- energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix , but that's never the tone that underwood is going for . he wants a warm , fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaiman's flute-and-wind musical score , and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background . it might as well have been a story about rival grocers , and every single character is about as uninspired as he or she could possibly be . i was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert king's previous screenplay , the dana carvey flop clean slate , so i had some hopes for speechless . but while there is wit in the words , this is a script which was probably much better on paper . on screen , it's still paper thin .

1223,"screenplay : deena goldstone . director : robert allan ackerman . films like safe passage have been a television staple for years . every once in a while , one will sneak its way onto the big screen , usually on the cachet of a big-name star or director ( a la ordinary people ) , and occasionally a great performance ( like kathy bates in 1993's a home of our own ) can turn tired material into something special . susan sarandon is a big name who turns in a great performance in safe passage , but even she can't save this mess . there are simply too many interchangeably troubled characters wandering around shouting at each other . and except for the remarkably well-adjusted twins , every one of them is working through some sort of neurosis or involved in the storyline in some way . there are simply too many characters bouncing around in safe passage , and director robert allan ackerman often seems like one of the reporters who appears at the singer house running after a quote . with writer deena goldstone , he has created characters who are little more than sound bites , and none of their problems seem to matter all that much . with this lack of focus comes the sense that no one making this movie really knew what it was supposed to be about . it's about all of these things , and it's about none of them . safe passage is filled with little snippets of development which run into infuriating dead ends , but there isn't really a point . mag seems to be developing a friendship with alfred's shy girlfriend , one which might establish a kind of parallel to her parenting , but it's only a footnote . patrick's vision problems seem to exist only to give sean astin's izzy something to worry about , and simon is confused , but no more confused than i was as i tried to figure out exactly why he even needed to be part of the story . safe passage simply needed about four fewer sons and a real identity for those that were included . it does have susan sarandon , though , and she makes up for a multitude of failings . but as good as she is , she isn't given a handle on who mag is , at least not one which can carry the film past its scattershot characterizations . a movie like safe passage , in which nothing really happens , depends on the development of strong characters to carry it through . safe passage is simply a collection of character mcnuggets .

1224,"screenplay : ross thomas . director : damian harris . there is a trick to pulling off a neo-noir thriller like bad company successfully . many young filmmakers and screenwriters seem convinced that it's all about mood-drenched cinematography , or a suitably twisty-turny plot . the fact is that while those elements might give a film a healthy start , they can't really make anyone care about what's going on . john dahl ( red rock west , the last seduction ) has re-ignited interest in the genre , not simply because he knows how to push the right technical buttons , but because he weds a great story with interesting characters . bad company is loaded with double- and triple-crosses , but it's hard to care much because the characters are so flat and bored-looking . bad company is the kind of movie with tech credits so slick that for a while i was tricked into thinking i was watching a good movie . it's a good * looking * movie , to be certain , with great production design by andrew mcalpine ( the piano ) and glossy photography of vancouver locations by jack n . green ( unforgiven ) . there is also , of course , some steamy sex , and it may be bad company's strongest selling point . it's not that the sex is all that spectacular , but it is between barkin and fishburne , and it's almost unheard of for a hollywood movie to include an inter-racial relationship without being * about * the inter-racial relationship . it's easy to see why a studio would green light this story without fear of controversy , though : fishburne and barkin may be black and white , but they're barely human here . barkin , meanwhile , is even less interesting . she's supposed to be a sexy "" ice queen , "" but even a femme fatale needs some sort of personality . a subplot in which margaret tries to take grimes out with crowe's help seems primarily intended to give her something vaguely interesting to do , because as far as i could tell the real story could have taken place just as easily without her . in fact , there are so many dispassionate performances in bad company that spalding gray's turn as the neurotic ceo of the tool shed's main client looks like he got the only cup of coffee on the set that day . the plotting in ross thomas' screenplay is reasonably clever , an interesting look at post-cold war espionage as a growth industry . while there are plot twists aplenty , they never feel piled on , nor did i need a scorecard to keep up with who was screwing over whom . the problem with bad company isn't * what * happens , it's to * whom * it happens . it isn't always necessary for characters to be likable , and in a dark thriller it may not even be desirable , but they need to be more than robots whose sole function is moving the plot forward . laurence fishburne , ellen barkin and company are fine actors , but they couldn't manage to act interested in anything that their characters had to say or do .

1225,"screenplay : max apple & stephen metcalfe . director : peter yates . it is a frequent but rather silly criticism leveled at certain hollywood films that they are "" manipulative , "" or push emotional buttons . it is silly because it is self-evident ; all art tries to make you feel a certain way , and movies are no exception . the real , unspoken criticism is that the movies targeted manipulate too obviously , and are usually specifically manipulating the audience towards a good cry . roommates is one of these awww-inspiring efforts , but it doesn't do the job . comprised of all the pieces that are supposed to work , roommates doesn't work because it lacks a cohesive story to complement peter falk's engaging performance . roommates seems like it could have been an interesting concept . generational conflict in film rarely involves characters separated by two generations , and there are very few films that deal with characters over 70 . make no mistake , falk's performance as rocky is entertaining ; he delivers his old world wisdom with wit and bite . but at a certain point , his characterization becomes caricature , just another grumpy old man who is one step ahead of his youngers . it is pleasant to watch rocky grow closer to his grandchildren , but it is less so to watch him grow progressively entombed in latex . the second , and far more glaring , problem is that the generational conflict angle is only a fraction of the story . when michael brings beth home , rocky makes no secret of his disapproval of pre-marital sex , and it is refreshing that his point of view is given a certain amount of respect by the filmmakers . a tense exchange between beth and rocky is very well handled by both julianne moore and falk , and highlights everything that was most promising about the idea for roommates . after a while , the plot jerks onto another tangent , this one spending far too much time focused on a custody battle and movie-of-the-week style family squabbling . that is a noble goal , but it simply does not work as a movie because there is never a clear enough sense of what this relationship is really supposed to be about . it certainly does not help that d . b . sweeney seems to be dazed and bored through most of the film's running time . roommates had the potential to be a warm and sentimental film , and for about half an hour it has the right tone of good-natured whimsy . but for over an hour , it is little more than a bad soap opera : drawn-out , confused and maudlin . "
1226,"screenplay : naomi foner . director : stephen gyllenhaal . it is one of film criticism's most ubiquitous put-downs--one i frequently use myself--to compare a theatrical feature to a tv-movie . such a description is intended to describe both subject matter ( usually topical or sensationalistic ) and manner of presentation ( usually didactic or sentimental ) . losing isaiah has garnered more tv-movie comparisons than i can count , but the comparison isn't entirely appropriate . but tv-movies generally feature one-dimensional characters and a specific agenda . losing isaiah features one-dimensional characters and a steadfast refusal to adopt a point of view . the subject of inter-racial adoption is a challenging and complex one , and no one would expect the makers of losing isaiah to deliver the final word on the matter . it isn't the absence of a patently obvious opinion from writer naomi foner and director stephen gyllenhaal which is the problem , but that there is only a cursory examination of any of the complexities involved . the inevitable court battle features the predictable array of speeches and finger-pointing , but none of these academic arguments are of much use to the audience . we need to see more of isaiah ( the adorable marc john jefferies ) interacting with the lewins , perhaps even being interviewed so his point-of-view could be understood . there is an attempt to deal with isaiah's state of mind in some very effective late scenes which show him responding to a new environment , but those scenes are too little , too late . similarly , the characters of margaret lewin and khaila richards are not characters so much as they are representatives of the two perspectives . the fact is , losing isaiah is far less about the lewins' life with isaiah than it is about khaila , whose redemption is the heart of the story . halle berry is impressive in the early scenes as khaila the addict , but in the film's later stages she becomes the 12-step version of the "" hooker with the heart of gold , "" too squeaky clean to be real . it seems to be the film's idea of balanced presentation not to give both mothers a character outside of their fierce conviction that the other one is wrong . stephen gyllenhaal's direction is usually best when no one is speaking . those scenes , and those from isaiah's perspective , suggest that if losing isaiah had been more intimate with its characters all the way through , the story could have worked . as it stands , a controversial subject becomes a minor plot device connecting the stories of two rather bland characters . losing isaiah's contrived ending is somehow appropriate for this wishy-washy effort .

1227,"tank girl is a movie made for the "" you just don't get it "" crowd . there is a segment of the movie-going audience , mostly young and mostly male , whhich takes a certain contrarian pride i championing oddball genre flicks which are generally met with critical disdain or indifference . these are the movies which come to be known as "" cult "" favorites , and are treated as something of a barometer of hipness . this is what tank girl is almost certain to be , and i'll bet that the filmmakers are quite aware of it . part road warrior , part adventures of buckaroo banzai and part natural born killers , tank girl is sometimes quirky and fun , but just as often merely loud and sloppy . it is a hyper-kinetic piece of work that never seems to be taking itself at all seriously , from the comic book page stills that introduce several scenes to the goofy and diverse personalities of the supposedly ferocious rippers ( genetically altered human-kangaroo hybrids , designed by special effects make-up whiz stan winston ) . there is malcolm mcdowell , still resplendent in his spiky sting-at-50 hairdo from star trek : generations , playing a much livelier version of the same megalomaniac . there is one thing of which you can't accuse tank girl , and that is being conventional . what it can be accused of is not being nearly as clever as it is self-consciously different . tedi sarafian ( sister of terminal velocity director deran serafian ) has provided lori petty with a lot of one-liners , but none of them have any kick ; in fact , i can't recall a single piece of dialogue from the entire film . petty is a great cast as the tough and unflappable tank girl , but she has to carry far too much of the film with her cocky demeanor , because her supporting cast ( excluding mcdowell , whose part is really fairly small ) is unimpressive . tank girl , both the character and the film , have attitude to spare , but often little else . perhaps as much as anything , though , i was distracted by james r . symons trigger-happy editing which , combined with a soundtrack compiled by hole's courtney love-cobain , makes tank girl feel like a feature length version of mtv's "" alternative nation . "" entire sequences are composed of snippets of petty posing and doing cute little things , apparently aware of the camera . the battle sequences are a real weak link , particularly one in which two separate battles are cross-cut ineffectively . it was after about the tenth song , sometime before the headache started to set in , that i began to feel that tank girl was one of those movies that had been marketed , not made . i wanted to like tank girl , but i kept feeling that the filmmakers kept daring me not to like it , daring me to be un-hip . guilty as charged .

1228,"screenplay : bryan goluboff . director : scott kalvert . all feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos , please raise your hands . thank you for identifying yourselves ; now would you all please go away . your influence has to rank as one of the most annoying trends in filmmaking in the last decade , and it shows no sign of abating any time soon . it isn't just the strobe light quality of your twenty-cuts-per-minute editing , or the numbing over-use of popular music artists on the soundtracks which makes me suspicious of any film advertised "" featuring the music of . . . "" no , it is a kind of cynicism you have perfected , banking on the idea that no one will care about the lack of a story if you include enough bells and whistles . your adaptation of the basketball diaries is loud and one-dimensional , serving only as the vehicle for a performance by leonardo dicaprio that is better in pieces than it is as a whole . the basketball diaries has been bouncing around as a project for years , but the sticking point has always been that jim carroll as a character was too unsympathetic and too much a loner . as a film , the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as a cautionary tale , a 100 minute long "" just say no "" public service announcement , but as drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is impossible to care much about anyone in the movie . perhaps we are expected to see jim as one of those "" good kids who falls in with the wrong crowd "" that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be ; i saw him simply as part of the bad crowd . without a character who changes in any appreciable way , the basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into a collection of crimes committed by jim and his strung-out cohorts , all choreographed to an oppressively loud soundtrack . director scott kalvert doesn't have many scenes with intrinsic dramatic impact with which to work , so he substitutes silly slow-motion photography , self-consciously funky camera angles and choppy editing . mostly , they just draw attention to how hollow the story is . they also don't allow leonardo dicaprio's performance to be as strong as it could have been . for every impressive moment , like his desperate attempt to get his mother to give him money , there is a scene where kalvert pulls too much of the focus to his own camera theatrics . dicaprio is most effective when he is playing off other actors , particularly a fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an ex-junkie who tries to help jim straighten out , but kalvert won't let character interaction define this story . at isolate moments , the basketball diaries is a fine showcase for dicaprio's talents . far more frequently , it looks like kalvert is trying to imagine what a long form velvet underground video might have looked like .

1229,"screenplay : david himmelstein . director : john carpenter . it's difficult to say whether it's a devoted core following or monumental chutzpah which accounts for john carpenter continuing to receive the possessory credit before his films . so seeing a film hyped as "" john carpenter's village of the damned "" doesn't exactly set my heart racing . and it's too bad , because as stylish as it is , village of the damned could have been a winner if not for some truly atrocious acting . even in his most uneven efforts , carpenter has demonstrated a great sense for how to use the screen . village of the damned is a typically impressive piece of visual direction , filled with subtly creepy scenes . there is one very nice split screen image after a key plot point , and a simmering level of menace in the scenes of the 7-year-old children in their paired marches . unlike carpenter's previous remake attempt , 1982's the thing , village of the damned doesn't rely on gruesome special effects in place of a well-constructed atmosphere . most of the time village of the damned has just the right feel . if only carpenter were as astute a judge of material and actors as he is of shot composition . narrative has never been one of carpenter's strengths , and the failure to include something as simple as a "" 2 years later "" caption makes for some unnecessarily awkward transitions . directing actors has also been a longtime problem for carpenter , jeff bridges' work in starman asside , but in village of the damned that problem is tripled by some mind-boggling casting choices . christopher reeve as the tragedy-stricken , intense hero ? or for that matter , as anything but a cartoon or video game voice-over these days ? the child actors are not much better , neither emotionless enough to be truly other-worldly or human enough to be the kind of "" hidden threat among us "" which can be so frightening . village of the damned almost pulls out a last second victory with a tense , well-staged climax , but it just isn't enough . it is a film with tone to spare , but like many of john carpenter's works , it could stand to trade some tone for a little substance .

1230,"screenplay : susan minot . director : bernardo bertolucci . this is a film of false starts , dead ends and pointless distractions which pays too little attention to what should be its central premise . most of them are given some kind of romantic sub-plot -- just enough , in fact , to be genuinely annoying . bertolucci repeatedly cuts away in the middle of a scene to an irrelevant tangent , or introduces characters for a few superfluous moments . it is as though he is afraid that with all the drinking , dancing and baring of breasts going on , we in the audience will forget that there are also serious issues to be addressed . the problem is that it is always clear which of lucy's two missions is of greater interest to him , to the other characters in the film , and probably to us . there's nothing wrong with a simple , erotic coming-of-age story , but bertolucci appears to be embarrassed at the thought of making a film which is about something as base as the loss of virginity . it's truly a shame that bertolucci was unwilling to focus on that one story , because it provides a few touching moments . there are moments like that when lucy is every bit as beguiling as everyone in stealing beauty seems convinced that she is , but bertolucci still carries on as though he is above it all . he also makes that voyeuristic opening video sequence all the more telling .

1231,"director : roland emmerich . whatever the production budget was for independence day , the marketing budget probably came close to matching it , and it appears to have worked . by all evidence , not a dime of it went to a good script doctor . by now , i am fully aware that the call for better scripts in summer blockbusters is a cry in the wilderness ; the success of twister has proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that little else matters if impressive visual effects are on the bill of fare . what makes independence day so frustrating is that its complete failure as a story does not appear to be the result of laziness . the half-dozen or so sub-plots which wind through independence day suggest that emmerich and devlin really wanted to make human drama matter . instead , they created a story full of one-dimensional characters , absurd coincidences and laughably uninteresting interpersonal conflicts . a couple of performances manage to rise above the nonsense -- will smith , who has far more charisma than this film deserves and is almost always entertaining when he is on-screen , which is not nearly often enough ; and brent spiner , who has fun as the eccentric scientist in charge of examining the remains of the infamous roswell , new mexico spacecraft from the 1950s -- but mostly there are forced emotions and nascent cliches like the bickering-estranged-spouses-who-still-love-each-other . but let's get down to the real business : at times , independence day looks great , a real apocalypse wow . the dog-fight sequences are complex and exciting , particularly a one-on-one battle between smith's capt . hiller and an alien fighter which whizzes through canyons at break-neck speed . at other times , believe it or not , it looks cheap . some of the digital effects are too soft around the edges , and independence day skimps on a face-to-face showdown with the aliens . that is a big mistake , because the only time in independence day when there is any genuine tension is when scientists get hold of -- and have to deal with -- an alien survivor . then again , a swarming alien ground invasion might have given emmerich and devlin just one more better film to crib from . even the film's self-promoted nickname , "" id4 , "" evokes terminator 2 : judgment day's "" t2 "" campaign from a few years ago . to top things off , the president gives what is intended to be a rousing address to his hopelessly outnumbered troops ; it was supposed to be his "" st . crispin's day "" speech , but it's so lame it makes you wondered how this guy was ever elected _class_ president . independence day appears to be the meticulously constructed result of one of those screenwriting programs which are supposed to give you all the elements for a complete story . . . and of course , all those elements come from other films . you can't buy inspiration , and independence day is woefully short on anything that rouses the imagination . it's a kick-ass trailer that's wagging a dog .

1232,"screenplay : sonke wortmann . director : sonke wortmann . of all the things i might claim to understand about movies , i suspect that what makes a given film popular with american audiences will never be one of them . with that in mind , what makes a film popular with non-american audiences ranks somewhere with "" what is the sound of one hand clapping "" on my personal scale of philosophical inscrutability . many is the film which has come to these shores trumpeted as "" one of the most popular films ever in ( fill-in-native-country ) , and it seems that for every once were warriors ( a record-breaker in new zealand ) there is a the mystery of rampo ( last year's japanese smash which turned out to be a bit of psychedelic soft-core porn ) . not ( "" die bewegte mann "" in europe ) , a silly and fairly aimless sex farce which provides a sexy star with very little to do . as it turns out , norbert is also just as interested in axel , and makes his intentions quite apparent . writer/director sonke wortmann has created an erratic comedy which swings back and forth from being an airy trifle to half-heartedly attempting genuine character development . the opening twenty minutes promise plenty of broad laughs , from doro's discovery of axel and a lady-friend in a bathroom stall to waltraud's frantic attempts to look remove his drag costume so as not to scare off axel . it appears as though wortmann is setting up some lessons for our two protagonists to learn from each other -- norbert will learn to make better romantic choices , and axel will become a more faithful partner to doro . then maybe . . . maybe not makes a jarring u-turn back to unapologetic , bawdy slapstick , and throws any pretense at character out the window . that wouldn't necessarily be a problem , particularly because the character developments were looking fairly obvious , except that the comic situations of the last half hour are equally obvious , and not very funny . wortmann directs it all with a sluggish inevitability , and takes a final turn back to sentimentality which suggests that he was just making the whole thing up as he went along . the chiseled-cheeked schweiger has become a superstar in germany as a result of this role , and outside of his obvious sex appeal , i can't quite see why . he tries to give axel a boyish charm to counteract his incomprehensible shifts in personality , but he is the prototype pretty face with little spark . similarly , joachim krol's award-winning role seems remarkably shallow , and shows that america doesn't have a monopoly on befuddling acting honors . the problem i had with both roles , and with maybe . . . maybe not as a whole , was that there seemed to be no point to any of it , no growth of character , and some unappealing messages . every male character is perpetually horny , axel is just as big a jerk when the film ends as he was when it started , and we are reassured that everything will be fine because doro will continue to be a door-mat and forgive axel's philandering yet again . perhaps it's just a cultural gap i was unable to cross , but maybe . . . maybe not struck me as only sporadically amusing , and sometimes flat-out irritating . which is why i will never make my living deciding what movies get made .

1233,"screenplay : james demonaco , gary nadeau . director : francis ford coppola . once upon a time , francis ford coppola was one of the most revered directors in the world , the creator of classic films like the godfather , the godfather part 2 and the conversation , part of an american renaissance of the 1970s which included names like scorsese , spielberg and altman . then came films which politely could be called ambitious failures -- one from the heart , the cotton club , tucker : the man and his dream -- and mixed critical reception for his third godfather film and bram stoker's dracula . it has been four years since dracula , more time to wonder if coppola could once again summon that special something . what he has summoned instead is jack , a frustrating patchwork of slapstick and sentimentality in which almost everything feels forced . at least that's what i think he learns . one of the reasons jack feels so muddled is that it is a film without a clear sense of who its vibrant character is . at other times it appears that jack is supposed to be the character who is meant to change ; he too gets a heartfelt and inspiring speech . diane lane doesn't get a heartfelt and inspiring speech , just plenty of heartfelt looks to tell us that she is learning to be less protective of jack . there is no law which states that only one character in a film can change , but we have to know with whom we are meant to identify , and coppola spends so much time being heartfelt that he fails to provide a definite protagonist . that leaves jack as a message film in which there is no clear message . jack will quite naturally inspire a great deal of comparison to 1988's big , but big was a pure fantasy which never felt the need to underline its lessons . coppola and screenwriters james demonaco and gary nadeau try to incorporate scenes of boys-will-be-boys playfulness ( and who among us hasn't been initiated into a club by lighting our bodily gases or eating disgusting food mixtures ) , as if to tell us "" we're just having fun here . "" that might be easier to accept if they hadn't also overwhelmed simple moments like jack calculating his mortality with the uberdramatic voice-over , "" what do i want to be when i grow up ? jack's ace-in-the-hole would seem to be never-quite-grown-up robin williams in the lead role , but there is something about his performance which feels uncertain . admittedly it is an extremely challenging part -- he's playing not just a 10-year-old , but a maladjusted 10-year-old -- but williams more often seems to be acting like a 6-year-old , just a step away from the baby-talk character he often used in his stand-up comedy routines , while his 10-year-old co-stars often act like they're 16 . coppola certainly knows how to make a good-looking film , with some clever touches like shots of jack's light-up sneakers . but jack usually comes off as sentiment without sense , and comedy without a foundation . once upon a time , francis ford coppola appeared to know all there was to know about making movies .

1234,"there is nothing quite as sad for someone who loves movies as watching a rookie film-maker who really wants to say something , but turns out not to have very much to say , or appears unable to say it in a way that connects . she has a sundance institute-approved screenplay , and all the studied quirkiness she can fit into 89 minutes . but krueger has created a predictable story with characters who still look like they exist on 3x5 notecards on her desk . manny & lo is a comedy-drama without enough of either . i suppose one of the things which irritated me most about manny & lo is that for an ostensibly original independent film , its basic premise has been done and done and done again . as comedy , think of ruthless people ; as social drama , think of last year's white man's burden . and those are just recent examples of stories which make the very psych 101 observation that kidnapers and their hostages aren't always so different , and sometimes bond to fulfill their respective needs . manny & lo doesn't offer much of a twist on the movie truism that if the plot is about a kidnapping , abductors and abducted will go from antagonism to uneasy truce to friendship . there wasn't a moment when i didn't know exactly where krueger was taking me . mary kay place , a much more experienced performer , turns elaine into something intriguing almost in spite of krueger . i think there is a tendency to give first-timers the benefit of the doubt on independent projects like this , because critics are usually aware of the limitations of time and money . i'm not sure that any of that matters to the audience . lisa krueger's intentions are good ; she wants to explore what can make a dysfunctional family functional , and how whether or not you perceived your family as dysfunctional can determine the effect it has on you . she also leaves threads dangling , introduces characters who do little or nothing to advance the story ( like cameron boyd as the terribly cute chuck , who hands out his signature to manny ) , and doesn't direct her script with an eye to making either the humor or the relationships as effective as they might have been . manny & lo is a slow , rather simple and not terribly entertaining film , and that doesn't change because krueger is inexperienced , or a woman , or not working for a major studio .

1235,"screenplay : lee david zlotoff . director : lee david zlotoff . maybe they smelled a female-appeal hit like fried green tomatoes ; maybe they liked the idea of countering the hollywood filth-monger mentality by supporting a film produced by clergy ; maybe , just maybe , they were genuinely touched by the story . whatever the reason , they have themselves a film which doesn't just jerk tears -- it slaps , kicks , pinches and pleads for them . the spitfire grill may be positive and uplifting , but it is so aggressive in the pursuit of your sympathy that it becomes exhausting . on its most basic level , the spitfire grill is yet another in a long line of films about benevolent strangers who teach intransigent folks a lesson in tolerance , and again the lead character is perhaps the most troubled , but not really the character who grows and changes . she is the sympathetic core of the film , and we grow to care about whether she will be able to find redemption . unfortunately , we never get to see her experience that redemption , and it is something of a cheat . it is never nearly as important to us that hannah makes peace with her demons , or that nahum learns to be accepting , or that any particular person ends up with the grill , but those are the only scraps we are tossed to give the spitfire grill any sense of consequence . in place of consequence , writer/director lee david zlotoff provides a film which often feels like a string of feel-good cliches , scored by james horner , the master of feel-good cliche music . zlotoff never misses the opportunity to send out scenes like tear-seeking missiles , scenes which might have been effective individually but en masse serve only to batter you insensible . if my description seems cruelly cynical , it is only because the spitfire grill numbs you with its pathos . in its own way , it is just as shallow as an action film which is just one explosion after another . the story goes that the spitfire grill was "" commissioned "" by a collective of catholic priests who wanted to back a film with "" positive human values , "" and i suppose you could say that they got what they ordered . everyone in gilead eventually does the right thing , and it is the kind of film which will probably end up on bob dole's hit parade . but in the course of injecting those human values , lee david zlotoff didn't bother to inject many human beings -- gilead , maine and nearly everyone in it ( particularly the terminally irrascible hannah ) seems plucked from a pepperidge farm commercial . alison elliott's performance is strong enough that , for a while , you might think the spitfire grill is about something , but it isn't about people whose troubles make you emotional . it's more of an endurance contest between you and your supply of facial tissues .

1236,"i suppose one cannot dismiss "" star search "" as an utter vacuum in the history of entertainment if it gave us sinbad . you may or may not recall that the comedian formerly known as david adkins got his big break by winning the comedy competition of the now-defunct talent contest a decade or so ago , and that's almost enough to make up for giving us carrot top . it's hard to explain my inordinate fondness for sinbad , except to note that i also loved bill cosby's stand-up , and i think of sinbad as cosby's natural successor in the same way eddie murphy can be considered richard pryor's . sinbad works clean _and_ funny , and he strikes me as an incredibly decent person besides . i have always believed that some day he would justify my faith by making a great film comedy . but first kid is not it . and it's not just a formula film , it's a formula film aimed at kids , which means that clever banter is never used to establish the antagonism where a pratfall , a bare backside or plenty of messy food can be used in its place . mind you , the film seemed to be perfectly hilarious to the kids in the audience , although i can't for the life of me understand why a film aimed at 12-year-olds included a cameo by sonny bono . still , as grossly predictable as first kid is , i still found myself smiling a lot at sinbad . i think he is the perfect star for a children's film , because there is something wonderfully warm and open about his screen persona . despite standing 6'5 "" , sinbad is more of an over-sized teddy bear than an intimidating physical presence , and every time he grins , it seems completely genuine . he has precious little to work with in first kid -- a bland mentor ( robert guillaume ) , an even blander president ( james naughton ) -- but the sheer force of his good nature keeps you hoping something will come along and be deserving . unfortunately , he is stuck playing with brock pierce , who is pleasant enough as the timid , self-conscious luke but doesn't have the spark to convince us he could be obnoxious enough to irritate anyone . i might not have had a real problem with first kid if screenwriter tim kelleher and director david mickey evans had done what it appeared they were initially intending to do , which is to tell a simple , harmless , goofy buddy story with lots of physical comedy for kids . however , they make a big mistake by turning the conclusion into a suspense drama involving an attempted kidnapping of luke ( extra credit points in cinematic obviousness 101 if you can guess the kidnapper just from my review ) . they seem to feel that it is necessary to show simms as a good agent as well as a good guy , and that is fine , but the gunplay which ensues is a bit too serious , making the last fifteen minutes somewhat inappropriate for young children . far better to give sinbad the opportunity to take over the film , since he was clearly the best thing they had going for them . first kid is not an unpleasant film , it's just a blatantly unnecessary one . ed mcmahon would not approve .

1237,"screenplay : steven baigelman . director : steven baigelman . i can't recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota . for forty minutes or so , i was lured into a loopy if occasionally over-wrought romantic comedy , and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt . then , rather suddenly , i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence ; shortly thereafter , i was whacked in the gut by another . feeling minnesota is a film that made me feel violated , as though i had trusted writer-director steven baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face . the wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments , most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin . you would have every reason to expect that relationships -- both familial and romantic -- would be the focal point of feeling minnesota . unfortunately , you would be dead wrong . i suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding , but i certainly didn't expect what i got . what i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality , or rather creating gags about brutality . the sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another , but there is no consistency to the characterizations . vincent d'onofrio turns in a manic performance as sam , whose jealousy , competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks , while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction , and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood . there are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully ( jonathan demme's something wild and neil jordan's the crying game come to mind ) , but they didn't try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment . i don't want to dismiss baigelman's successes out of hand -- he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop , and some well-crafted comic moments -- and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as a light-hearted caper . it _is_ his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value , and that he can't make his two halves into a whole . feeling minnesota left me feeling used , and there's not much funny about that .

1238,"screenplay : walter hill . director : walter hill . running time : 100 minutes . depending on your degree of cinematic acumen , last man standing is either a ) a prohibition-era remake of akira kurosawa's 1961 classic yojimbo ; b ) a prohibition-era remake of sergio leone's 1964 classic a fistful of dollars ; c ) a prohibition-era action drama with a completely original story-line . new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category ( c ) than in the other two combined , much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons . the fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing , which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the _real_ source material , the dashiell hammett novel _red harvest_ . it also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself . viewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint , and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes-cum-bastardizations . director walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids , including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity , but at least he doesn't try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture . what he _does_ do is nearly as big a mistake , and that is to provide a running voice-over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard-boiled style of pulp detective fiction . yes , that narration is full of cliches , but those are are not particularly troubling . the problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters . they were a mystery , to the other characters in the film and to the audience , their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted , and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status . it feels like a hammett novel , all right , and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice , but it simply doesn't work . even if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate , i can't imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction . willis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith , but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else . christopher walken plays doyle's brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft-spoken psychos , and there isn't another single character whom makes even the slightest impression . with no compelling antagonist for smith , there is no build-up towards the expected showdown , and when it does come , that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about . cinematographer lloyd ahern ( who also did the only noteworthy work on hill's 1995 flop wild bill ) creates some nifty sunburned vistas , but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter-productive narration . sometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original , they'll wonder what all the talk was about . in the case of last man standing , it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about . "
1239,"accompanying the press materials for curdled were a few newspaper and magazine articles about actual services which clean up violent crime scenes , services like the one which is a key part of the film's premise . if you want a sure sign of an insecure rookie film-maker , that would be it . i suppose the idea is to impress upon us the real-world foundation of the story , but i simply don't care ; an adept film-maker can sell me his premise over the course of his film . what the articles really tell me is that director and co-writer reb braddock found the concept for curdled in real life , and what the rest of the film tells me is that he didn't quite know what to do with it . for a while , curdled is perversely interesting simply because gabriela is such a unique character . she understands enough to know that other people will not consider her obsession normal , but her enthusiasm makes it difficult for her to contain herself , making for some uncomfortable moments with a potential romantic interest ( bruce ramsay ) and with her co-workers . the black humor in the script by braddock and john maass comes from watching jones' off-beat performance as a woman who shows a wide-eyed glee at being right where dark deeds were done . however , even that bit of character development is subverted for a cheap , easy gag . curdled seems to bounce from realism to surrealism with a capricious indifference . ultimately , this confusion points to a director who does not seem to be in control of his material or his characters . there is a lot going on at various points in curdled , but none of it leads anywhere : the central character doesn't grow , there is no real sub-text about human nature , and there is not even a consistent tone to allow it to work as a cathartic genre picture . it is evident that braddock grabbed on to a basic situation with potential , and that he was able to create an intriguing central character to place in that situation , but that he just didn't know where to go from there . curdled sports a few neat stylistic flourishes , including an eye-catching opening title sequence and a great scene where gabriela does a sensuous dance around a murder scene , but for the most part it is just one big , long , sick joke with a punch line that is not particularly worth the effort . someone should have thought about telling a story , instead of just mailing one .

1240,"screenplay : robert locash , pat proft , jerry zucker . producers : jerry zucker , pat proft , gil netter . starring : jon lovitz , tia carrere , mekhi phifer , louise fletcher , malinda williams , guillermo diaz . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity ) running time : 86 minutes . the naked gun ) that it misses one of its most obvious gags : there is nary a "" dick clark "" gag to be found . obviousness was never really an issue for the zuckers , because their modus operandi was a non-stop assault of puns , pratfalls and pop culture references , allowing every dud joke to be swallowed up by the next one in line . high school high doesn't seem to have time for that kind of comic machine-gunning , because it is too busy with -- of all things -- a plot . and this is that rarity among contemporary films , one which needs less plot instead of more . high school high was directed by erstwhile b-actor and pcu director hart bochner , and he shows little aptitude for the kind of frame-filling humor which characterized other zucker parodies . nearly every gag is front and center here , providing little incentive to scour the background for throwaway bits . on the rare occasion when a joke is tucked away for discovery -- like a sign in a topless bar-cum-theater which promises "" next week : all-nude ibsen "" -- it is like a gift . too much of the time , however , writers zucker , pat proft and robert locash measure out the laughs as though aware that there aren't that many to go around . they also can't seem to decide what kind of laughs they are going for . i'm not going to suggest that low humor hasn't always played a significant role in zucker films , since they were inspired largely by mad magazine , but there was usually the sense that they were writing dumb comedy for smart people , jackhammer-subtle but intricately absurdist . high school high is not nearly as clever , aiming many of its gags at the same audience which tri-star is targeting with a hip-hop-heavy soundtrack . the number of jokes aimed at gays or lesbians runs in the high teens ; the over-use or mis-use of urban slang runs a close second . the dependence on a soundtrack and the surprisingly straight-forward narrative often make high school high feel less like a parody of dangerous minds than a slightly more amusing remake of dangerous minds . actually , in some ways it resembles this year's the substitute even more , with its sub-plot of drug dealing and administrative complicity , but the substitute was a more subversive film . high school high is not nearly hard enough on the cliched movies made for and about urban youth , perhaps afraid of insulting its own audience . with its cast a combination of comic actors like lovitz and dramatic actors like fletcher and phifer , high school high slides uncomfortably between mockery and schlockery . the surest sign of high school high's spartan comedy is that it almost isn't worth staying through the closing credits , where the zuckers usually tossed off half a dozen silly little references . it's just a basic crawl this time , which also sums up the pace of the film rather nicely .

1241,"yet the chamber depends on such warm fuzziness when it comes to matters of race , because its thinking is equally fuzzy . it is one of the chamber's many bits of convenient ignorance that adam makes his plea with absolute earnestness , despite the fact that his own father suffered and struggled not to turn out like sam . of course , it may be that chris o'donnell knew no other way to make that speech , because earnestness is the only emotional pitch in which he seems capable of performing . the chamber may toss around ideas about racism , the politics of criminal justice and corruption in high places -- all pet peeves of grisham's , if his oeuvre is any indication -- but ultimately it really comes down to the face-offs between hackman and o'donnell , and man oh man but o'donnell is wrestling out of his weight class . there may be no more inconsequential actor in american films than chris o'donnell , a pretty boy who makes you want to re-evaluate keanu reeves as a multi-shaded thespian . then there is gene hackman , an actor with the ability to make you sit through nonsense like this just for the chance to watch him do his thing . it is a really little more than a piece of anti-death penalty propaganda , but hackman sells it with such conservation of emotion that it doesn't feel as obvious as it should . he makes that speech a statement about the feelings of his character , which is the mark of a superior actor : the words he speaks are his . films about condemned killers have been all the rage lately , but the chamber is both the most weightless and the most subtly offensive of them all , because it is so disingenuous in its portrayal of sam .

"" it also seems strangely appropriate that bugs bunny is voiced by billy west ; with its bodily functions humor , space jam seems less like a vehicle for bugs than one for west's other cartoon voice roles , ren and stimpy . murray's comic persona is the human descendent of bugs bunny , a wiseacre rebel unfairly smarter than his adversaries , and he is a riot in his scant minutes . space jam is a commercial construct , and it feels like it . how sad that a brilliant comic creation like bugs bunny has to ride shotgun with a wooden basketball star , all to provide a set of collector's cups .

1243,"writers are smacked around so often and with such impunity in hollywood that it is perfectly understandable when a writer insists on directing his or her own material . it similarly makes sense , i suppose , for a playwright to want to direct the film adaptation of his own material , and herb gardner has been unusually protective of his plays . in 1986 , he directed his own adaptation of the goodbye people ; in 1996 , he directed his own adaptation of i'm not rappaport . clearly gardner is attached to his creations . in fact , he is far too attached . another director might have identified i'm not rappaport as a meandering play with one interesting idea , and given it the good tightening up it needed . gardner clings to every line and situation , turning out a sluggish and repetitive meditation on aging . i'm not rappaport is about a man's attempt to retain his dignity in spite of advancing years , and there are strong possibilities in the character of nat . walter matthau and ossie davis both give solid performances , obviously appreciating their own opportunities in rare leading roles , and there is an affecting sincerity to their comments about giving respect where it is due . that scene between nat , midge and danforth is noteworthy not just because it is the best one in i'm not rappaport , but also because it says everything gardner has to say that is worth saying . the relationships are not compelling enough by themselves to carry those scenes , and the point that seniors are under-estimated and mis-treated is made and made and made again . as i'm not rappaport wanders through the last of its 133 minutes , you may begin to feel that you have been sitting in your seat as long as its main characters have been alive . worse still , it leaves us with the depressing notion that the elderly should be seen and not heard . gardner didn't need to take us through over two hours of hoops just so that we could end up right where we started . well-intentioned and well-acted though it might be , i'm not rappaport is the product of a writer too married to every word , and a director too sparing with the knife .

1244,"producers : dmitri villard , richard attenborough . director : richard attenborough . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , adult situations ) running time : 110 minutes . in love and war , a thoroughly mediocre attempt at an intimate epic , suffers the added disadvantage of extraordinarily bad timing . that is not to say that in love and war would have been a better film if it had been released a year ago . it does mean , however , that the points of comparison between this film and its two predecessors make its weaknesses all the more evident . and he never lets you forget it for a moment , either , trotting out spectacular locations , battlefield footage and a grandiose score by george fenton . unfortunately , the locations are shot flatly by roger pratt , a couple of the battlefield scenes are dropped in like sympathy-seeking mortars without a moment of set-up , and fenton's score is as loud and relentless as any theater's sub-woofers could withstand . sweeping characters like this aside doesn't take a particular strong broom , as it turns out . after failing to provide the grandeur of the english patient , in love and war then can't muster the kind of convincing characterizations which at least made the whole wide world watchable . sandra bullock is capable of making agnes somewhat appealing , and of lending a modicum of plausibility to the script's portrayal of her as the most fought-over female creature since helen of troy . as for chris o'donnell . . . well , don't you just want to pat him on the head and send him to bed with a glass of milk ? you half expect "" mrs . robinson "" to start playing on the soundtrack . o'donnell is even worse trying to play the disillusioned sot hemingway becomes , when his raging outbursts seem more like petulant hissy fits , but by that point no one in the audience will care much about him anyway . as an indication of how inconsequential the central romance between agnes and ernie is , in love and war actually gains momentum during the half an hour of screen time when the focus turns to agnes' relationship with dr . caraciolo . the venice locations create a glowing romantic setting , and bonucci turns in a nice performance as the stiffly chivalric suitor . o'donnell's ernie is about as lusty as cub reporter jimmy olsen , and in love and war is reduced to its familiarity -- an epic drama with no drama , and a personal story with no personality .

1245,"i have to give this to meet wally sparks : if you've ever seen rodney dangerfield before , you're going to get exactly what you expect , and if you've never seen rodney dangerfield before , you have no business being in the theater . dangerfield isn't an actor ; he isn't even a personality . he is a persona , a leering 70-year-old adolescent who has parlayed not getting any respect into a career most entertainers would envy . the irony in the dangerfield persona is that he has in fact gained respect , or at least appreciation , from a generation of young comedians . meet wally sparks turns out not to be simply a vehicle for dangerfield to do his schtick , but a great big tribute in his honor , a dopey but almost reverent celebration of rodney at his rodney-est . dangerfield plays wally sparks , the host of a tabloid talk show which has developed a reputation for being the sleaziest example of a sleazy genre . meet wally sparks is an extremely busy movie , which is not the same as saying that a lot happens . even the most die-hard dangerfield fan must admit that a little bit of rodney goes a long way , and the script seems almost desperate to provide sub-plots which will allow the star to take a breather . there really isn't any point to any of it , except to pad the running time , and at 106 minutes it certainly feels padded . when it all wraps up -- with a wedding , no less -- there are going to be a lot of numb buttocks in the theater . i'm not really sure why the even bothered with a plot at all , since it's all about rodney . the 25 minutes which take place at the governor's fund-raiser set the tone , as wally wanders through high society like an even more lecherous groucho marx , a walking punch line in search of a straight line to a gag about sexual potency , sexual frequency , sexual organs or just good old-fashioned sex . it is so obvious rodney's world that it is almost a shock when anyone else gets a joke ( the pratfalls to which stiers , roche and others are subjected notwithstanding ) . or at least taps them over . there are a couple of genuinely funny bits in meet wally sparks -- in one , wally inadvertently breaks the genitalia off a male nude statue , then does a very bad job of hiding it in his pocket -- but this isn't a film built around comedic creativity . on the contrary , it is a tribute to comedic venerability , like a henny youngman performance with half the audience providing the obvious and familiar double entendre before rodney can . the film is so self-aware on that point that wally's son gets one scene in which _he_ anticipates the joke and mouths the punch line . it's all terribly dumb and predictable , but it doesn't matter to anyone involved because this is less a rodney dangerfield film than "" rodney dangerfield : this is your life , "" with a host of guest stars turning up to honor the star : jay leno , roseanne , tim allen , bob saget . tony danza and michael bolton even turn up to do dangerfield impressions , and if you think you've seen it all , you haven't until you've seen michael bolton do dangerfield . meet wally sparks is likely to be a snooze to anyone who is not arriving similarly to worship at the altar of rodney . it is a strange experience watching a movie where everyone in the film , perhaps hoping for dangerfield's personal benediction of "" hey , kid , you're all right , "" seems more interested in entertaining the star than in entertaining the audience .

1246,"producers : clint eastwood , karen spiegel . director : clint eastwood . when we first encounter luther whitney ( clint eastwood ) in absolute power , he is sitting in an art gallery sketching hands and eyes from paintings in one of those slow , silent moments characteristic of an eastwood-directed film . at that moment , you may be tempted to break into a slight smile , impressed that eastwood has merely fleshed out his character under the guise of plot development . perhaps , you think , this won't be just another plot-driven conspiracy thriller . perhaps three-dimensional characters are going to make it something special . just wait sixty seconds . luther manages to escape , but the president's people know there was a witness . almost any other director would have taken this material and made it a big , dumb hollywood thriller -- and frankly , that probably would have been the best thing for it . eastwood is a director with a precise control over the details of his films , but in absolute power he spends so much time fussing over those details that he fails to notice that the story is completely absurd . while eastwood is able to construct clockwork sequences like an ambush at a coffee shop , he doesn't seem to care that , like much of what goes on in absolute power , it is resolved through pure coincidence . even the casting manages to get in the way , specifically the casting of hackman as richmond . the press notes for absolute power boast of hackman's career that "" there is no such thing as a 'gene hackman role , ' "" but that simply isn't true . it is also hard to figure out how the pathetic , libidinous drunkard of that opening scene becomes the take-charge whip-cracker , or why his press conference in support of his grieving friend sullivan demonstrates such a lousy poker face you wonder what kind of politician this guy could possibly be . the script , by the legendary william goldman , does offer a few nice touches and typically snappy dialogue , and ed harris plays the detective investigating the murder as a courtly and respectful spin on the usual foul-mouthed cop . when a central character seems to be a different person from scene to scene , however , those little details lose a lot of their charm . that brings us to eastwood's luther whitney , as baffling a screen character as i can recall . eastwood's acting has grown more interesting with the passing years , more relaxed and subtle , but he has devoted nearly every ounce of energy in the creation of absolute power to making his own character sympathetic . never mind that before that scene we had no indication that whitney even knew the man in the sullivan house was the president ; in fact , the scene plays funnier and more interesting if whitney is such a recluse that he doesn't even know what the president looks like . but everything is subjugated to giving luther the moral high ground , making him a doting father and a good citizen with a handful of quirky traits . i'm willing to grant the conceit that whitney is a master of disguise even though it doesn't seem particularly necessary for a sneak thief -- maybe he needed a hobby when he tired of sketching the old masters in the smithsonian -- but absolute power lost me when it became clear that this man who could disarm any security system in the world couldn't program a vcr for his alibi .

1247,"somewhere along the line , the makers of romantic comedies stopped caring about whether their lead characters had any business being together . perhaps in response to the complex ritual late-20th-century courtship has become , audiences began to embrace film romances which had as much to do with sorcery as chemistry -- sleepless in seattle , four weddings and a funeral -- and film-makers have been only too happy to provide more of the same . the fairy tale , a perfectly enjoyable expression of our dreams , is no longer simply a supplement to realistic love in the movies ; it practically has replaced it entirely . fools rush in is the next logical step in the transformation of screen romance into a celebration of fate . perhaps more than the audience can withstand , as well . fools rush in scripter katherine reback doesn't provide one really interesting conflict between alex and isabel -- she provides a dozen moderately diverting conflicts , with characters who are on screen barely long enough for you to remember their names . there is so much quarreling and scowling and meddling and fretting going on from so many different directions that you might find yourself wondering if you have forgotten how perfect they are supposed to be for each other . don't worry , you haven't forgotten . all evidence suggests that the only thing right in the relationship between alex and isabel is really great sex , and i am not discounting the value of really great sex when i say that it's not nearly enough . fools rush in belongs to that class of romantic comedies which demands that you accept the central pairing as celestially foretold , and curse you for a fuddy-duddy with no sense of romance if you object , as john cleese once did in a classic "" cheers "" episode , that the only thing opposites attract is divorce . what makes fools rush in all the more frustrating is that there are plenty of moments when it is tremendously entertaining . you don't need to be a fan of "" friends "" to appreciate perry , who can fire darts of sarcasm and do reaction takes with the best of them . he can be both funny and warm , as he is in an appealing sequence at a fuentes family gathering , and it is easy to feel sympathetic towards alex despite his near-sighted careerism . salma hayek is also quite good , conveying conflicted emotions and frustration , and there is certainly heat between perry and hayek ( although , let's face it , hayek could generate heat in a room full of asbestos ) . but fools rush in needs more than heat . it needs a heart , a sense of connection which comes from friendship as much as fantasy . in a film which throws so many problems and situations at the screen that nothing sticks together , it is ironic that the only thing which does stick together -- alex and isabel -- probably shouldn't .

1248,"mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 101 minutes . i'll give this to paul thomas anderson : he's got a sense of atmosphere . hard eight , anderson's feature writing and directing debut , may be even more successful than leaving las vegas at making casinos look ugly , and his characters exchange dialogue as though every word had to be yanked out of them with pliers . that's the good news . the bad news is that hard eight is yet another frustrating independent film by a rookie film-maker who has an idea of what his film should be _like_ without having an idea of what it should be _about_ . though generally well-acted and interesting to look at , hard eight is more a collection of thematic ideas than a story . an extended sequence during the first half hour of hard eight might lead you to believe that the film is going to be a revelatory study of the gambling culture . it is an interesting lesson in deception -- as is a later instruction on how to steal pay-per-view movies which could send hotels all across america scrambling to cover themselves -- which gives hard eight a welcome sense of authenticity . that sociological curiosity factor isn't enough to sustain a film , though , and sooner or later anderson has to get down to the business of examining the relationships between these characters . at least he should have , but he never does . we see far too little of sidney and john together to get a sense of their friendship , making the significant revelations to come ring totally false . we get a chance to see him in a variety of situations -- playing the big shot at a craps table , cleaning up after john's messes , showing kindness to waitress/hooker clementine ( a thanklessly unpleasant role for paltrow ) -- without really giving us a sense of who he is , as though anderson thinks teasing us with a dark past is sufficient . it's not . every once in a while , hard eight breaks out of its languid stupor long enough for some gratuitous violence , a half-hearted attempt at fooling the audience into thinking something is happening . every time , it doesn't take long for the film to settle back into a bleak somnambulism . jackson's profanity-laced tirades are entertaining to a point , but it soon becomes clear that he's merely recycling riffs from pulp fiction's jules because there isn't anything here on which he can base a unique character . he's not really a character at all here ; he's a plot device , someone who turns up when it's necessary for something to happen . a number of things happen in hard eight , but none of it adds up to a narrative we should care about . hard eight is evocative but thoroughly unsatisfying , a film in which an oppressive atmosphere of foreboding is the real central character , crushing the human characters like empty beer cans .

"" so what other properties do we own ? "" "" um , i think we have 'the saint' , "" answers executive #2 . it is a nice set-up for a story about an enigmatic loner . unfortunately , it has nothing to do with the character as played by val kilmer . there isn't much haunted , complex history in his characterization ; kilmer spends most of the film looking tremendously self-satisfied , posing behind each disguise and purring every accent . sure it's fun watching kilmer play a variety of eccentric characters , and you can bet that he knows it . when the film takes a sudden shift in tone near the conclusion , turning into a light-hearted caper for the final ten minutes , it actually seems as though director phillip noyce ( clear and present danger ) threw up his hands and decided to let the saint become the film kilmer had been acting in for the previous 100 minutes . actually , it's never clear what the saint is supposed to be . for an action film , it certainly treats the ostensibly primary plot and its associated action as an afterthought . it is interesting to see new faces like serbedzija and valery nikolaev ( as tretiak's son ) in the villain roles , but the roles themselves aren't interesting at all . there are a couple of sharp sequences when the saint actually does provide some action -- emma's dash for the american embassy and simon's unnerving underwater stay in an icy river are particularly notable -- but too many other moments fall flat . some of the action appears to have been salvaged from mission : impossible's cutting room floor , with editing that butchers punch lines , introduces and discards supporting characters , and leaves plenty of threads dangling and questions unanswered . if anyone can explain to me the importance of the microchip the saint steals from tretiak , or why tretiak never makes an effort to retrieve it , i'd sure like to know . i suppose it might seem hypocritical of me to knock the saint for spending so much time developing the romance between simon and emma after i have criticized plenty of other action films for spending no time at all on such matters . shue struggles to make some sense out of a character who has to deliver a lot of exposition and whose weak heart is magically strengthened by love , but it's hard to play a romantic scene with someone who seems to love himself even more than you love him . the saint was unlikely to be a great film even without kilmer's preening , but it would have been a less grating one . perhaps the _real_ sequel to mission : impossible should involve someone trying to tame kilmer's ego .

1258,"once upon a time , many years ago when the earth was still young , i read comic books . in fact , i read them quite avidly . i attended comic book conventions , kept my collection in acid-free boxes and bought the overstreet price guide every year . i remember the fervor with which comic book fans defend their favorite characters , and the excitement generated by the first film appearance of a character . my first encounter with this phenomenon from the other side of the philosophical fence came when i dared to give only fleeting praise to 1994's the crow . from the reactions of the film's fans , you would think not only that i had challenged the film's artistic merit , but also that i had performed an excretory act on brandon lee's grave . the idea for the story , i felt , was intriguing , the execution merely competent . and the wrath it raineth down . now i steel myself once again , because folks , spawn ain't even _that_ good . anyone familiar with the crow is going to experience a bit of conceptual deja vu with spawn . at its best , spawn does provide some genuinely eye-catching visual effects for its titular character . spawn's body armor is perfectly rendered , sprouting all manner of computer-generated weaponry and a billowing red cape as necessity demands . leguizamo also provides entertainment value by tossing off crude gags between bouts of flatulence . at its worst , spawn provides the kind of horrid acting often excused in genre films with the description "" campy , "" with half the cast ( white , sheen , leguizamo ) doing gutteral line readings ( because the forces of evil always talk like mercedes mccambridge in "" the exorcist "" ) and the other half ( randle , williamson , d . b . sweeney ) standing around looking befuddled . it also offers a decidedly sony play station vision of hell , and a script which doesn't bother to give the main character a life before it gives him an afterlife . most of the time , however , spawn is neither at its best nor at its worst . it is merely redundant , a now-familiar plot of gloom-soaked heroism decked out with the expected trappings of perpetually rainy alleys , gothic spires and a couple of explosions . i'm not familiar enough with the time line of recent comics to know whether "" the crow "" pre-dated "" spawn "" in comic book form , but it doesn't really matter . viewers of spawn may find a few new and improved special effects , but everything else is re-used and recycled ; even leguizamo's performance as clown seems like a slightly more scatalogical spin on nicholson's joker . comic books may have picked up a certain improbable cachet when they started referring to themselves as "" graphic novels , "" but that attitude has merely resulted in a different kind of creative rut . it's like graphic grunge rock , where an energetic and invigorating first wave has given way to endless imitators who can't seem to lighten up and stop whining . even when screenwriter alan mcelroy tries to temper the angst with glib quips , the result is something strictly for fans of the new and improved special effects . or , perhaps , for die-hard spawn fans who may be preparing an effigy of yours truly even as we speak . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

"" surreal "" might as well be something you have at breakfast with milk as far as silverstone's performance is concerned . when it comes to playing material with an edge , she seems . . . well , it's much too late for her to recover her adorableness by the time the romance turns more conventional , complete with dialogue ( "" do you like my tummy ? "" ) which should come with a warning label if you're going to listen to it with a mouthful of popcorn . i can't imagine what silverstone's young fans will make of this strange film in which their idol is annoying and unlikeable , then hooks up with such a weirdo . if silverstone the newly-crowned mogul wanted to make a romantic comedy , she shouldn't have cast benicio del toro . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1261,"promotional posters for she's so lovely describe it as "" a film by nick cassavetes from a fable by john cassavetes , "" a tag-line which prompted a visit to my american heritage dictionary : 1 ) a concise narrative making an edifying or cautionary point , often employing as characters animals which speak and act like human beings . "" i suppose you could say that she's so lovely fits that definition , in the sense that it makes a cautionary point . as for animals acting like people , you won't find any in she's so lovely . people acting like animals . . . well , that's another story . there is at least a convincingly seamy aura to the portion of she's so lovely devoted to eddie and maureen's kinetic romance . vintage cassavetes ambiance drips from the depressingly silent flop houses and dive bars , and from the characters wandering around in a directionless , drunken daze . yet even in its best moments , she's so lovely feels not quite right . it's like the steak transported through the telepods in david cronenberg's version of the fly , a story from another era which has been rendered synthetic in its transport to 1997 . despite the strong performances and affectingly crazy exploits of penn and penn , there's the feel of an homage to the first half of she's so lovely . it has no unique identity . to show you how far looking for a unique identity gets you , witness the second half of she's so lovely . but young cassavetes treats the whole episode as the wacky premise for a profane situation comedy , as though papa had banged out a very special episode of "" my two dads "" twenty years ago . the whimsical score by joseph vitarelli consistently undermines the seriousness of the matters at hand ; situations like eddie's appointment with an effeminate hairdresser are treated as atmospheric goofiness . instead of wondering whom maureen will end up with , your mind wanders to why nick didn't go all the way and use a laugh track . for that matter , it's not clear what john was thinking when he wrote it , with its half-realized characters , awkwardly constructed narrative and weightless romantic triangle . there's a lesson to be learned here , something like "" it's best to let sleeping scripts lie .

1262,"director : jocelyn moorhouse . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , brief nudity ) running time : 104 minutes . no one involved is pretending a thousand acres _isn't_ a gloss on "" lear . "" the front cover flap of jane smiley's pulitzer prize-winning 1991 novel flatly proclaims it , and the film's production notes explain the connection in detail . but that didn't have to be all there was to the film . there was certainly plenty more to smiley's novel , an engrossing tale filled with lyrical prose and finely-observed details about the daily routines of farm life . that sense of a specific place , as well as the specific time of malaise-era 1979 , gave the novel a distinctive feel which transcended the familiarity of the basic plot elements . director jocelyn moorhouse's rendering of the story , on the other hand , never quite stakes out its own territory . sure , it retains smiley's unique sympathy for the daughers -- her angle suggests lear deserved everything he got , and then some -- as well as the strong sibling relationship . both jessica lange and michelle pfeiffer turn in strong performances , particularly lange as the placid , unquestioning ginny . yet even their relationship can't hold a thousand acres together once laura jones' script starts racing from melodramatic plot point to melodramatic plot point , as though capturing every sordid detail would result in capturing the essence of the material . without the poetry and perspective of smiley's language , the story becomes little more than a collection of tragedies -- shakespeare without the wisdom or the words . it's like something out of a pitch meeting from the player : "" it's king lear , but it's funny , and sad , and with breast cancer , adultery , domestic violence , alcoholism and child abuse . "" actually , not exactly sad , and not at all funny . even when the film turns to pathos , it never allows the audience an emotional catharsis because no one seems eager to reach a resolution . meanwhile the only laughs are of the gallows variety , mostly connected to realizations that characters have suffered yet another humiliation , with a dash of mixed shakespearean metaphor ( a reference to the merchant of venice's "" pound of flesh "" ) thrown in for good measure . talented cinematographer tak fujimoto does his best to capture smiley's iowa landscapes visually , but his is an effort doomed to failure . it's a character shakespeare didn't come up with , and it's one of the things which gave a thousand acres its own personality and resonance on the page . how sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have such a disappointing adaption . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1263,"director : gary fleder . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 115 minutes . i'm thinking of putting together a self-help book which would assist talented performers trying to come to terms with making a terrible film . i'd call it something like "" smart actors , foolish choices , "" or maybe "" why bad movies happen to good people . "" within its pages would be testemonials and guidance , reminding the readers that they're not alone in making the isolated career blunder . bad example . for an actor wallowing in "" what was i thinking ? "" , of course , my motives wouldn't be entirely altruistic . my research might also help me understand how films like kiss the girls come to pass . somewhere in this trite , uninspired psycho-thriller , two gifted actors found something worth exploring . i wish i could figure out what that thing was . it's not just that kiss the girls trots out the over-used serial predator as its villain , or that it relies on a "" surprising "" revelation of the villain's identity ; both devices can be used effectively , and have been in recent years . kiss the girls doesn't work because there's no reason to care about who casanova is , what he does , or what he's going to do . director gary fleder never generates any tension or simmering menace , assuming that murky cinematography will do his work for him . perhaps he spends so little time on the tone because he has a hard enough time keeping the viewers focused on the basic facts of the plot . some of his narrative leaps are utterly baffling , sending audience members into a frenzy of muttered "" who's he's "" and "" where are they now's . "" to be fair to fleder , his directionless direction matches the directionless script with which he's working . the characters in kiss the girls are so thinly defined that it never seems to be about anything but plodding along until it's time to unmask casanova , yet even that major plot point is ineptly handled . screenwriter david klass doesn't bother to drop the faintest clue about who casanova might be , to the extent that he could have been picking a name out of a hat when casanova finally shows his face . worse still , klass doesn't bother to explore the villain's motives . shouldn't we care _why_ ? the only bright spots in kiss the girls , not surprisingly , are the performances by freeman and judd . even then , the script doesn't pull us into kate's emotions . it's hard to believe there was anything on the page which made these characters -- or this by-the-numbers story -- seem appealing , but freeman and judd took them on anyway . maybe these parts were the best they could find . maybe they suffered severe brain cramps at critical moments . i feel their pain . . . i had to _watch_ kiss the girls . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1264,"there is no doubt in my mind that david duchovny can be a movie star . his often under-appreciated work on "" the x-files "" has demonstrated both dramatic chops and a wry sense of humor , as well as the requisite physicality for action . duchovny has the looks , the smarts and the range on the big screen to go places most fellow tv alums never go . it's also clear that he knows how to pick interesting scripts . to a resume which already includes unconventional fare like kalifornia and the rapture , duchovny adds mark haskell smith's playing god . smith's script does about all you could ask a script to do , delivering some well-developed characters and smart dialogue ( okay , there are a couple of howlers ) in service of that premise . duchovny selected a nice piece of material to work with , but playing god shows that an actor can't choose most of the things which go into the making of a good film . it has the feel of a film which should have been much better , but turned out inconsistent and sloppy under the first-time direction of andy wilson ( of the popular cable mystery series "" cracker "" ) . there are times when wilson tries so hard to create his gritty thriller atmosphere -- all distorted imagery , slow motion and awkward cross-cutting -- that the narrative begins to get lost . he's going for the right mood , but with the wrong methods . duchovny also had no control over the performances of his cast-mates , though from all appearances , neither did the director . his performance might have been even more effective if a dozen other supporting players weren't making unhinged seem so unnecessary . the general tone of the performances makes duchovny stand out like buster keaton in a three stooges short . his deadpan demeanor begins to seem like a reaction to a bunch of nutcase actors let loose on the screen , rather than the appropriate personality for his redemption-hungry character . in fact , duchovny is too "" together "" most of the time ; rock bottom doesn't look all that bad if that's where he's supposed to be when we meet him . then again , it's hard to say whether that particular character choice was duchovny's to make . you can see his star quality in playing god , but you can also see that picking a sharp script is no guarantee that an actor will be in a sharply-made film . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1265,"by the time dennis quaid , the ostensible star of switchback , makes his first appearance at about the 22-minute mark , you may find yourself wondering why he bothered . all the necessary conflicts seem to be in place -- the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work , and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the other's protagonist . it wouldn't be fair to reduce everything that's wrong with switchback to quaid's presence , but it's a pretty good place to start . there's a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center : as a dramatic actor , dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation . we can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is a perpetual tight-jawed , sourpuss pucker ; we can tell he's grim because every word comes out in an eastwood-esque rasp . a more flexible performer might have given weight to the character , pulling the audience into his haunted intensity , making switchback _his_ film . quaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated . it's tough to become emotionally invested in a character's turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes . even without quaid , it doesn't appear that switchback would have stayed on course . the early scenes between leto and glover have a lively energy , building our curiosity over which man -- the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor -- is the real threat . unfortunately , stuart tips his hand far too early in the game , both through the pitch of the individual performances and the facts he chooses to reveal . once the mystery of the killer's identity is dispatched , the interaction between leto and glover becomes stale and predictable . it's too bad stuart wasn't willing to spend more time with sheriff olmstead , far and away the most interesting and appealing character in the film . a film focusing on the olmstead would have signaled a film-maker willing to take a few risks with his casting and story-telling . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1266,"screenplay : melissa mathison . director : martin scorsese . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , adult themes ) running time : 135 minutes . martin scorsese's kundun , advertised as "" the amazing story of the fourteenth dalai lama , "" is a beautifully filmed and extraordinarily reverent bio-pic . and it's a strong dose of cinematic nyquil . though it's bound to please those who admire its subject , other viewers are going to wonder why they should spend over two hours watching a film with only the faintest whisper of internal conflict . the most frustrating thing about kundun is that it's the kind of story i've chastised hollywood for not telling . unlike the recent seven years in tibet , it is a story set in tibet which is actually about tibetans , featuring a cast composed entirely of non-professional actors . that gives kundun a greater sense of integrity , but it does nothing for the dramatic impact of the story . what we see scarcely a moment of is the dalai lama as an individual . though he sometimes sees terrible visions , this preternaturally serene teen almost never seems shaken or lacking in confidence . the resulting film is completely faithful , but it moves like a tortoise in need of a laxative . when the dalai lama begins looking through his telescope as an adolescent , i started hoping he'd spot brad pitt so the production could find some energy . eventually there is a bit more interest generated by the dalai lama's interactions with the chinese . though this ideological battle should provide plenty of chances for strong dramatic sequences , it rarely does . even a few more such moments could have given the suffering of the tibetan people a face and an emotional connection . this is a history of a repressed people which almost never leaves the confines of the world of politicians . martin scorsese is too talented a director to put together anything that is a complete waste of time . it's what happens in front of that backdrop which may cause you do drop back in your seat and grab a quick nap . as important a story as kundun may be , the film rarely does more than trudge through fifteen years of tibetan history , always careful to show the utmost respect for his holiness . perhaps scorsese saw this as an opportunity to make up for his previous attempt at the life story of a revered figure , one which sparked instant outrage . no chance of controversy this time around -- think of kundun as the lack of temptation of the dalai lama . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1267,"the film , on the other hand , isn't quite so resolute . the images are powerful and immediate , but they become the story rather than complementing it . henderson begins to seem like a character digitally insterted , forrest gump-like , into historical events . when the story does focus on his actions , it fumbles away too many opportunities to personalize its grand-scale tragedy . character relationships , like those between henderson and a brash american reporter ( woody harrelson ) and his no-nonsense producer ( kerry fox ) , get just enough attention to be frustrating ; henderson's devotion to an orphan named emira ( emira nusevic ) is rushed until it feels more like a cinematic necessity than a genuine connection . even the film's most potentially intense sequence , involving the illegal transport of a bus-load of orphans out of the country , feels strangely sedate despite one gripping encounter at a bosnian checkpoint . that sequence doesn't even serve as the film's climax , leading into a dry 20-minute search for emira's birth mother which grinds welcome to sarajevo to a halt . far too often , winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce demonstrate a clumsy disregard for building a narrative with an emotional pull beyond its bursts of authentic violence . i can easily imagine a film like welcome to sarajevo degenerating into pathos in hollywood hands , so perhaps it deserves some credit for avoiding copious shots of sad-eyed waifs . winterbottom simply goes too far in the other direction . the performances and direction are sturdy but rarely inspired , resulting in a film which makes us feel terrible about this tragic conflict in a very abstract sense . welcome to sarajevo is good reporting , but it's not particularly good drama , treating its subject with the concerned detachment of a newsmagazine feature story . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1268,"fallen proves that if you want to evoke millennial dread , you can't just flirt with it -- you've got to embrace it . all are talented performers who acquit themselves admirably , but not not a one of them has much to work with in nicholas kazan's script . the dialogue is certainly effective , particularly in its laconic familiarity of co-worker and familial interaction . the story simply doesn't create a single compelling character to anchor the narrative . that includes hobbes , who remains a vaguely heroic cipher despite the work of consummate professional washington . in fact , the only real spark of personality comes from the film's body-hopping villain , who occupies so many different characters that he provides more of a menacing general presence than a specific personality . while gregory hoblit puts together a few unique and creepy moments , including a chase through a busy city street which becomes a psychic relay race , his approach to the material is disappointingly conventional . his tone is that of a slightly-gloomier-than-average crime drama , with filtered point-of-view shots used and over-used ass the only distinctive signal of a demonic presence . in short , it's just not all that disturbing , or even particularly creative in its approach to the subject of demons walking among us . isolated moments build effective tension , but hoblit and kazan ultimately resort to the kind of obligatory "" gotcha "" climax which can leave an audience with the faint aftertaste of cleverness despite a general lack of substance . like hoblit's primal fear , fallen is a well-made and well-acted film which too often settles for the easy or obvious way to handle a situation . when that situation involves the vengeful soul of an ageless fallen angel , you should hope for a bit more than gunplay and the crooning of rolling stones tunes . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1272,"at the 1998 sundance film festival , writer/director boaz yakin commented that a price above rubies isn't so much specifically about life in the hasidic jewish community as it is about "" being an individual in any society where conformity and tradition dominate . "" the story could just as easily have taken place in the amish country , apparently , or in any other highly conservative culture . in a cinematic era of hot air and gimmickry , it's hard to fault a film-maker when he's trying to tell a story _about_ something . unfortunately for yakin , beginning with a theme doesn't work when the cultural atmosphere is as crucial to a story as hasidic judaism is to a price above rubies . you can feel the world shifting constantly within her , conveyed through the naked emotionalism of zellweger's performance . it's a movie set with costumes and props , into which sonia might just as well have been dropped like an alien into a spielbergian american suburb . yakin commits himself so thoroughly to making sonia a genuinely complex character that he doesn't take the time to fill in the background . it certainly doesn't help that some of the blind-to-a-fault casting stretches credulity to the breaking point . british actor christopher eccleston chews on his new yawk accent as though he were about to blow a bubble with it , while creating a borderline melodramatic rendition of manipulative villainy . if you want to distill what doesn't work in a price above rubies into two words , try to imagine renee zellweger convincingly uttering the magic words , "" oy gevalt .

1273,"there comes a time in a critic's life when he simply has nothing to say about a film as gruellingly generic as mercury rising , but he's got space to fill so he keeps on jabbering away anyway . this is the kind of action film where dogs jump out of nowhere to spook the audience , where glass shatters in slow motion , and where children are placed in jeopardy . it's the kind of action film which went through a slew of title changes -- from simple simon to simon to mercury falling to mercury rising -- but may as well have been called bruce willis action film project 1998 . it's competent , business-like and utterly uninspired . i suppose mercury rising deserves at least an ounce of credit for trying to make its protagonist human . nice try , bad idea . i don't know who thought it was wise to remake rain man as a gritty thriller , but it's a combination that falls completely flat . though willis is a cut above his action hero contemporaries as an actor , he still can't work miracles with a character reduced to baleful stares and hoarse whispers as he vainly struggles to befriend his troubled charge . it's not just that he has trouble connecting with simon , which is sort of the point -- he has trouble connecting with anyone . it's that kind of creative deja-vu which makes sitting through mercury rising such a chore . it's not that it's a terrible film ; in fact , director harold becker's pacing is a cut above recent genre cousins , the narrative never actively insults , and the performances are solid all the way around . mode , even gets off a sharp little inside joke when he tells a mach-posturing willis "" you've been watching too many of those 4-wheel-drive commercials "" ( baldwin himself being the television voice of chevy trucks ) . but those are the kind of moments you grasp for when you've seen the same film a dozen times a year for the last five years , when you've written about the same film a dozen times a year for the last five years . if your objective in watching a film like mercury rising is spending a two hour block which will immediately blur into previous two hour blocks , you've found a winner . you may even have something worth writing about it . if so , i've got a couple of column inches you could help fill . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1274,"i can't remember a film getting as much mileage out of a single visual gag as my giant gets out of its one and only visual gag . soon the unlikely pair are on the road together , every scene between them something that momentarily fools you into thinking there _must_ be some special effects at work . it's enough to make you wonder why they don't make silent films anymore , when this one could have been thoroughly enjoyable without a single character opening his or her mouth . crystal , for his part has always been good with a reaction take and a vaudevillian's sense for milking a laugh visually . saturday night and now my giant . david seltzer's script piles on the pathos so thick -- tender moments between sammy and his estranged wife ( kathleen quinlan ) , sad-eyed tete-a-tetes with his son ( zane carney ) , lillianna's rejection of max , a potentially life-threatening ailment for one main character -- that it threatens to crush everything in its path . the few decent jokes crystal manages to squeeze in between the heart-felt glances hardly seem worth the effort . muresan , meanwhile , is just too endearingly goofy not to look at , a great dane puppy in a peasant shirt . if you've seen his hilarious snickers commercial , in which he hawks an eponymous cabbage-cented cologne on a home shopping channel , you know muresan has charm and a surprising comic sense . you would also know that , compared to muresan's marble-mouthed diction , andre the giant sounded like he studied with henry higgins . it's an undemanding role , one in which muresan demonstrates infinitely more screen presence than fellow hoopster-cum-thespians like shaquille o'neal and michael jordan . you just can't help wishing that the big guy would continue to smile engagingly while embarking on fewer adventures into the english language . whatever its failings , my giant is almost worth watching simply for a few jaw-droppings cenes featuring steven seagal . playing himself on the set of an action movie where max might play the villain , seagal shows more willingness to poke fun at his image than i ever suspected he had in him . when his director asks if a scene could be better with one more take , a casually arrogant seagal answers , "" no ; "" when he makes a call to sammy's son as a favor , he allows the skeptical boy to mock his look ( "" that stupid ponytail "" ) , his acting ( "" lessons . . . how about taking a few ? "" ) and his muttered line-readings ( "" are you going to go hang out with stallone so i can understand you _less_ ? "" ) for five minutes , my giant is comic genius , and seagal deflates himself masterfully . my giant has its moments , but its generally such a tepid and non-threatening comedy that the moments can't add up to much . feel-good shmaltz like this works much better when you don't have to listen to the shmaltz being spelled out for you . call me old-fashioned , but i prefer to imagine a version of my giant made 70 years ago , where no precious speeches got in the way of chuckling at mis-matched protagonists . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1276,"director : bille august . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity , violence ) running time : 131 minutes . i've been hearing people refer to the new film adaptation of les miserables as "" lay miz , "" which goes to show what the common frame of reference is going to be . that abbreviated moniker comes , of course , from alain boublil and claude-michel schonberg's immensely popular musical adaptation , which has been selling out theaters around the world for over a decade . they know all this not so much because they are familiar with victor hugo's novel , but because of that musical with its signature waif-and-tricolor iconography . bille august's straightforward rendering of les miserables makes you realize exactly why the story works so well as grand opera . the film is certainly faithful to most basic events of the novel , though it cuts certain characters entirely and chops other encounters down to a bare minimum . it's not textual fidelity which is lacking in les miserables ; it's emotional scope . virtually every scene feels muted , the passions tamed to a state of dignified dissatisfaction . what les miserables really needed was for someone , anyone , to break into song . the stage production captured the sweeping melodrama of hugo brilliantly -- the battles carried a tragic grandeur , the conflicts shook the foundations of society , and the deaths were moments to jerk tears from the driest eyes . there is no substitute for the kind of dramatic economy music or a well-constructed song can provide ; three minutes of furtive conversation between cosette and marius ( hans matheson ) can't create nearly the convincing sense of love at first sight that three minutes of "" in my life "" does . the film seems to have been crafted and edited strictly to make sure certain necessary plot details were included , with little interest in building momentum towards a cathartic release . from a certain standpoint -- one with no musical preconceptions in the way -- les miserables is perfectly effective as period drama , and a fine introduction to the classic story . technical credits are first rate , with costumes by the gifted gabriella pesucci ( the age of innocence ) and effective recreations of 19th century paris . the exceptional cast does generally sharp work , particularly rush in a more interesting and subtle performance than his oscar-winning showcase of tics and flourishes in shine . often , however , it feels as though august is keeping them all on a leash , eschewing musical theater in favor of "" masterpiece theater .

1284,"mafia ! , like its predecessors airplane ! , the naked gun and hot shots ! , is a scorecard comedy . their goal has always been to throw as many puns , sight gags , movie parodies and bodily function gags onto the screen as 90 minutes could hold , operating on the premise that you gotta keep swinging if you wanna get hits . at the end of the film , a viewer's reaction is likely to be a subconscious evaluation of the jokes' batting average . if hits exceed whiffs , everybody wins ; if whiffs exceed hits , not so much . has two strikes against it before it even shows up at the ballpark , the first and most obvious being its satiric target . entrenched though the films and their situations may be in the cinematic canon , mafia ! just feels stale , as topical as a joey buttafuoco joke or a reference to bella abzug's hats . at least the godfather films will be well-known to most average viewers , though . the other major reference points are martin scorsese's mob-themed films goodfellas and casino . the number of gags baed on the latter film , including the opening credits sequence and the character of pepper ( pamela gidley , a dead ringer for sharon stone ) , is utterly baffling given casino's less-than-spectacular box office performance . references to more recent , more familiar films like forrest gump and the english patient draw big chuckles , while the casino references draw mostly blank stares . ( though curiously that title still appears on-screen ) , but no one gave nearly as much thought to the actual content of the film . the second strike is the "" trailer factor , "" which is always a danger with a broad comedy like mafia ! since virtually none of the jokes are contextual , and 90% of them can be conveyed in a matter of moments , the people who put together theatrical trailers and television spots are free to plunder the film for all the best laughs . it's easy to pull 120 seconds worth of "" a "" material from mafia ! , sight gags like a shattering poodle and an overweight ersatz river-dancer , but you're sadly mistaken if you think that's a representative sample . if you've seen that theatrical trailer for mafia ! , with its two-minute barrage of great bits , you've probably laughed about as hard as you're going to laugh at the whole 85 minues of the film . comedies like mafia ! are usually entertaining just for forcing you to pay attention . dozens of decent laughs hover around the perimeter of the frame , while several of the best moments come during the closing credits , including a great riff on the standard "" no animals were harmed during the making of this film "" disclaimer . it's the jokes abrahams places front and center which drop with a thud just a bit too often . as just one example of the lackluster writing , the "" guess what number i'm thinking of "" table in one casino scene is a joke swiped from vegas vacation . . . and abrahams offers plenty of moments worth a snicker or a grin , but ultimately that laugh scorecard just doesn't come out in his favor . for those of you scoring at home , that doesn't add up to winning offense . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1286,"did you ever get the feeling that brian depalma designs entire films around set pieces he thinks would be really cool ? think about mission : impossible -- can you recall more than a few scattered seconds aside from the computer room break-in and the train tunnel finale ? the trivial business of building a story between cool sequences frequently seems to bore him ; if there were a directorial equivalent for "" script doctor , "" he'd probably be all over it . that opening reel is a nice piece of work , and an ideal showcase for cage at his bug-eyed , manically-grinning finest . there's a kinetic artistry to the scene as depalma captures the excitement at the event , the shark-like constant motion of our protagonist , and the unstable nature of the events about to occur . we recognize instantly that for every pie in atlantic city , there's rick santoro with his fingers deeply immersed or doing his best to dip them in . we also recognize that somewhere in the dizzying scene are the clues to what will come next . what will come next is an investigation of the shoting which often feels like an afterthought . the story's arc is clearly designed to lead santoro towards a redemptive choice -- cash vs . the right thing -- but it seems to take an awful lot longer than 90 minutes to get there . and that's not to say that snake eyes doesn't move . in fact , depalma rarely stops moving , mixing up extended point-of-view sequences with tautly-edited pursuits , throwing in a drifting overhead pan through a series of hotel rooms for good measure . snake eyes has technical virtuosity and sheer forward momentum to spare . what's missing is heart , a reason to care about stringing depalma's shiny individual baubles together into cinematic jewelry . by the climax , depalma seems to have lost all focus on making snake eyes a redemption thriller , hinging a pivotal sequence on a turn of the weather . between that stormy sequence , the extended speeches in which the villains explain their motivation , and the tagged-on romantic coda , you may find yourself wondering what the point of it all could be . i suppose snake eyes could satisfy an audience as a display of craftsmanship , but that really defines why so few of depalma's films satisfy as stories . he's not really a film-maker . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1287,"producers : peter frankfurt , wesley snipes and robert engelman . director : stephen norrington . mpaa rating : r ( violence , gore , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 118 minutes . blade is a comic book adaptation , which in recent years has meant you could expect one of two approaches : brooding and violent ( the crow , spawn ) or gaudy and hyper-kinetic ( batman and robin , the mask , tank girl ) . blade is no exception . . . sort of . instead of choosing one familiar path or the other , the makers of blade have chosen both -- it's brooding , gaudy , violent _and_ hyper-kinetic . the surprising good news is that it comes impressively close to succeeding at both . the bad news is that means it doesn't entirely succeed at either one . the premise alone is intriguing enough to give it a fair shot . flash forward to the present day , where that son has grown up to be blade ( wesley snipes ) , a hybrid with all the strength of a vampire but none of the weaknesses -- he can walk in daylight with impunity , eat a pizza with extra garlic , and so on . all right , the latter portion doesn't qualify as any sort of intriguing . it's more in that gaudy and hyper-kinetic category , a climactic conclusion to two hours of punishing , extremely sanguine action . it's also extremely effective action , directed by former special effects make-up artist stephen norrington at the kind of blistering pace generally associated with jackie chan films . make no mistake , blade _moves_ , with dynamic fight sequences and a parade of gruesome special effects -- exploding vampire heads , disintegrating vampire bodies , vampire skeletons crawling out of their skins . with snipes anchoring the action as the chiseled anti-hero , blade's frenzied , over-the-top battles offer plenty of visceral thrills . of course , it has to pause every once in a while for exposition , which usually is where films of this kind collapse into a puddle of stupidity . blade , on the other hand , teases with provocative concepts that ultimately go nowhere . when the militant deacon rejects the assimilation tactics of his elders in favor of "" vampire power , "" it could have been the basis for more complex themes than you'd ever expect from a comic book thriller . is blade , for all his righteous wrath , merely engaging in a sort of "" ethnic cleansing ? "" interesting questions , if anyone had bothered to ask them . unfortunately , the politics of vampirism quickly gives way to simple , rapid-fire good guy vs . bad guy stuff . blade keeps setting you up to expect that the sub-text is going to matter somehow , then always bails out for another round of spinning back-kicks and shotgun blasts . i suppose you could take a glass-half-full view and applaud both the quality of the action and the mere attempt to give depth to the viscera . there's just too much viscera , and not enough depth , to take that attempt seriously . it's an exciting under-achiever -- to brooding to be pure gaudy fun , to gaudy to let its brooding go anywhere interesting . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1289,"producers : laurence mark and roger birnbaum . director : mark steven johnson . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity ) running time : 113 minutes . at least they prepared me right off the bat , right there in the credits . i didn't need to wait long to understand how many liberties , thanks to an admirably forthright screen credit : "" suggested by the novel _a prayer for owen meany_ . "" not "" inspired by , "" not "" based on , "" not even "" loosely based on "" like the 1995 travesty of _the scarlet letter_ . i wish i had known johnson was taking suggestions , because i might have offered a few . right about there , all similarity to the source material ends . sure , a few individual details remain , notably a school christmas pageant which goes dreadfully awry , but even that element is given an ill-advised twist . the film's simon , like his literary counterpart , has a preternaturally mature sense of existential purpose , an almost arrogant belief that god intends great things for him . it makes no sense for that character -- who schemes in the novel to be the baby jesus in the nativity play because he thinks only he can do the role justice -- to be turned into a grumpy and reluctant christ-child . johnson goes for the cheap laughs of projectile vomiting and pre-pubescent groping rather when he should be trying to maintain some consistency in his characterizations . i don't mean to suggest that simon birch is an awful film , particularly if you walk in like most viewers with no knowledge of irving's novel . the friendship between joe and simon is unique and well-developed , though the more experienced mazzello makes first-time screen actor smith look quite self-conscious at times . the first half of simon birch is generally satisfying , a sprightly and quirky reminiscence cast in the autumn tones of aaron e . schneider's cinematography . it's the latter half , which diverges most sharply from irving's story , that goes most horribly wrong . the music score ( by the ever-cloying marc shaiman ) begins reminding us every several seconds that it's time to weep , eventually building to the orchestral equivalent of yanking out your nose hairs one at a time . with its "" oh by the way , in case you're a complete moron , here's the moral of the story "" punch line of dialogue , simon birch is less emotionally cathartic than it is emotionally insulting . johnson doesn't just streamline irving's sprawling narrative , he dumb-lines it , casting everything in the broadest tear-jerker strokes . what a waste of a singular story to turn it into a trite hallmark card of a dramatic experience . the power of suggestion sure can make people do foolish things . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1290,"here's the faint praise with which i ultimately damn the governess : while i was consistently interested in the film , i'm not sure i could tell you what the point of it all was . we know that rosina is a stranger in a strange land ; will the central conflict be a clash of cultures ? the answer to these questions and more is a resounding "" sort of . "" yet all the rich background provided by writer/director sandra goldbacher teases without adding up to enough . most disappointing of all is the lack of interest goldbacher shows in developing her secondary characters . mrs . cavendish , a potentially touching portrait of repressed longing , instead becomes comic relief described as though "" she had a lemon stuck up her bottom . "" even more mysterious is young henry , whose obsession with rosina may be an act of rebellion , or perhaps a fleeting adolescent crush , or perhaps some mixture of the two . in any case , it certainly doesn't mean enough for a lingering scene of henry writhing naked in the surf to provide anything more than the film's _second_ gratuitous penis shot . driver's strong , sensual performance as rosina and wilkinson's turn as the conflicted charles do fill in plenty of gaps , but it's tough to get caught up in a romantic square composed of one real woman , half an identifiable man , a pale and petulant enigma , and a stick figure wrapped in a shawl . all the time that might have been spent sorting out their motivations is spent instead on a metaphor so massively obvious you might trip over it on your way out into the lobby . leaving aside rosina's forrest gump-like discovery of the darkroom and the concept of saline solution developing , the entire photography angle feels like one long attempt to distinguish between our two principal characters -- she wants to capture human faces ( i . e . what we don't see is what this has to do with any of the other cultural or sociological tidbits goldbacher drops along the way . driver's rosina is a compelling enough presence that you'll want to put the pieces together , but you'll find far more ambition than resolution . the governess fairly drowns in context desperately seeking some content . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1291,"screenplay : jim kouf and ross lamanna . director : brett ratner . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , profanity ) running time : 96 minutes . life , they say , is all about trade-offs , but rush hour asks for a trade-off that just doesn't seem fair : in order to watch jackie chan in action , you've gotta listen to chris tucker in action . chan is one of the most engaging performers in films , a creater of ingenious martial artistry whose personal charm makes his jaw-dropping stunt work even more fun to watch . tucker , on the other hand , may be the funniest guy on the planet some day , but i'll never know it until he stops reading every line in the mellifluous tones usually associated with a circular saw . chan is great ; tucker is grating . rush hour balances the two nearly perfectly , creating a synthesis that is pure cinematic mediocrity . i suspect tucker might have been thinking of rush hour as his beverly hills cop , a chance to play the street-wise rebel with a badge in an action comedy setting . there's no question that he has his adherents -- the folks in the theater who were howling with glee and stomping their feet at his every bug-eyed shriek -- but i can't see tucker crossing over into the kind of broad popularity enjoyed by eddie murphy . the reason is quite simple : where murphy generally seems amused by the foibles of his on-screen foils , tucker seems perpetually irritated . every canned insult he spews makes him that much more unpleasant to spend time with -- not exactly the vibe you're looking for in a leading man . director brett ratner may not have the visual flair of chan's frequent collaborator stanley tong , but he's smart enough to get out of the way and let chan do his thing ( some sloppy editing choices notwithstanding ) . a jackie chan fight sequence still has the ability to dazzle the way no other fight sequence can , mixing silly bits of business with lighting-fast choreography . rush hour is nothing but fun when it's nothing but a showcase for chan , whether he's fighting bad guys while trying to protect a priceless piece of chinese pottery from harm , or scaling walls and trees in a manner more feline than human . on paper , the collaboration between chan and tucker probably looked like an ideal match of opposites -- one the self-deprecating physical comedian , the other the self-aggrandizing verbal comedian . rush hour is less a jackie chan/chris tucker film than it is a jackie chan film alternating with a chris tucker film , each performer taking turns yanking the predictable material into his preferred comfort zone . if you're a fan of both lead actors , you'll probably get the double-barreled rush the makers of rush hour were aiming for . if you're like me , you'll find it misfiring as often as it hits its target . only then could i safely and happily suspend my disbelief . only then could i forget what i had been forced to endure from the other half of the star tandem . trade-offs can be so cruel . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1292,"director : david veloz . in the last few minutes of permanent midnight , writer/director david veloz introduces a jarring element of irony to what had been a fairly straightforward dark night of the soul drama . the film's coda shows stiller-as-stahl , having written his confessional autobiography , appearing on a series of television talk shows to promote the book and bare his soul . in one of the film's best lines , stahl explains in voice-over that the most humiliating thing he ever did as the result of his addiction was "" appearing on 'maury' . "" a good gag , but also a pretty self-serving one . in an era when celebrity mea culpas are just another part of the public relations landscape , a film like permanent midnight has to work extra hard to function as an honest cautionary tale rather than a plea to love me , feel sorry for me , let me back into your hearts . the film makes sure we know about stahl's troubled family life , including two suicidal parents , which already suggests that stahl and/or writer/director david veloz is pointing fingers outward as much as inward . watching the character pitch his book -- which , of course , became the movie we're watching -- takes every harrowing moment which preceded and makes it cheap and exploitative . that's truly a shame , because stahl's story is given a harrowing conviction by ben stiller's performance . though best known as a comic in films like the hit there's something about mary , stiller is a versatile performer who makes heroin addiction about as ugly as we've ever seen it . it's funny yet pathetic watching stahl trying with a ridiculous lack of success to disguise his stupors as artistic eccentricity ; even other self-absorbed hollywood types instantly recognize that he's utterly useless . what's fascinating about stiller's performance is that there's never a moment when his character appears to be functional as an addict . unfortunately , there's nothing besides stiller's performance to make us care about permanent midnight . there's not much at stake as we watch stahl disintegrate , nor is there a particular reason to care if he's earned his second chance at love . he's just another cleaned-up hollywood junk-head with a tale to tell , probably one of a thousand . the last five minutes of permanent midnight are as ill-conceived as any five minutes of film this year , because they make it look like stahl is just a different kind of self-absorbed now . you're left with the uncomfortable feeling that for him , addiction is just a marketing hook . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1296,"the pieces are familiar , but they don't quite fit together . extended , surrealistic , dialogue-free musical interludes are used to advance character and set tone . campy dialogue , gaudy costumes and ambiguous sexuality flourish . speculative romantic connections are established between roman-a-clef versions of pop music stars , accompanied by effectively pseudo-period new songs . it's citizen kane meets pink floyd the wall , the rocky horror picture show meets grace of my heart . and that's saying nothing of the suggestion that oscar wilde , the father of flamboyance , was an alien progeny . welcome to the evocative , provocative world of writer/director todd haynes , the man who used barbie dolls to tell the story of karen carpenter in the little-seen underground film superstar , and who fashioned a sublime , complex cautionary tale about environmental and psychological collapse in safe . in velvet goldmine , a fictionalized account of the early 70s glam rock scene , haynes takes a somewhat appropriate style over substance approach . the center of the story is the rise and fall of ziggy stardust . . . i velvet goldmine is less a narrative than it is a long-form music video , intriguing images full of manufactured outrageousness ( including the bizarre oscar wilde prologue ) . as such , it certainly re-creates its era effectively . the music , the mood and the theatricality are all pure glam ; rhys meyers looks perfectly the part as pop creation already beginning to eat itself . but haynes piles stylish surface on top of stylish surface in velvet goldmine until it never quite gets at the heart of anything -- not the artists , not the appeal of glam , not even whether the scene was about social change or filthy lucre . it certainly comes awfully close on occasion . in one wonderfully cross-cut sequence , arthur's sexual awakening is connected to the sexual excesses of slade's entourage , suggesting that even in their self-absorption the glam rockers -- often tormented as children for their sexual individuality -- succeeded at expanding boundaries for other youth . yet even this storyline spins into an absurd , pointless conspiracy-mystery which arthur could have put together only by actually viewing footage from the film we're watching . that's the kind of infatuation with his own film-making that haynes displays in velvet goldmine . because it's always visually engrossing , it keeps holding out the hope that it's going somewhere substantial . instead , it offers the cinematic equivalent of hip-hop sampling , turning into a montage of visual and musical cues from other pieces of popular cinema ; haynes even cribs from superstar with a romantic scene between two dolls . if glam was somehow about the fine line between profound and shallow , haynes has hit the mark dead on . this is one deliberately confounding spectacle . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1300,"producers : mark canton and irving azoff . director : troy miller . mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , mild vulgar innuendo ) running time : 95 minutes . at the half-hour mark of the family fantasy jack frost , the titular character has not yet been reborn as a walking , talking snowman a year after his death thanks to a magic harmonica tune . it's cute , yet utterly weightless . there are worse things , i suppose , than a harmless bit of family shmaltz for the holiday season . keaton is engaging enough as the hustling , slightly immature human jack , goofing with charlie in a way that suggests he's more interested in being a playmate than being a father . there's at least one very lively chase sequence which will charm the young ones , as well as a welcome paucity of inappropriately sniggering content . and it's true that the snowman ( courtesy jim henson's creature shop ) is a nifty creation , just the right combination of classic look and human expressiveness . there are enough giggles and guffaws in jack frost to make it fun for youngsters without either embarrassing parents or boring them entirely to sleep . what makes it hard to swallow is that it's utterly inconsequential while pretending to be both hipper and more emotional than it really is . 'cause if it is , that's not even very clever . "" yet despite attempts to show that the film is a bit above its cutesy premise , it's rarely anything more than a syrupy trifle , sentimental without being resonant ( from a story by mark steven johnson , who made the sentimental , resonance-free simon birch ) . one could argue that jack frost isn't really about jack at all , but about charlie ( a generally understated performance by joseph cross ) , in need of closure after the loss of a father he barely knew . even that take on the story doesn't give it any added pull , not when the script keeps adding simplistic touches like a bully who abruptly drops his bullying and helps charlie because he too understands what it's like to be without a dad . eventually it's hard to identify any significant story at all as jack frost becomes more derivative and rushed towards its climax , complete with a final vision of the human jack so reminiscent of ghost i expected "" unchained melody "" to burst out on the soundtrack . jack frost isn't so much a story as it is a diverting bit of special effects silliness leading up to a sob cue . it taught me something important about what really matters in a film script : a character arc for the protagonist that's not complete before the first plot point . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1301,"director : tom shadyac . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 115 minutes . we've seen this robin williams before , though not much recently . this is robin williams the crowd-pleasing riff-meister , playing the comedy-drama character arc in which he is temporarily sobered by tragedy but eventually emerges triumphant in the lives he has touched with humor . this is the robin williams -- the stand-up comic with the heart of gold -- that we see in patch adams , the fact-based story of a medical student whose unconventional approach to patient care endears him to patients while irritating the establishment . unfortunately , we've never seen this character so compromised by such an aggressively feel-good film . the first half of patch adams certainly belongs to williams the clown , given free rein to do his stuff ; not coincidentally , it's also the most entertaining half . his rebel with the mile-a-minute mind delivers quite a few laughs through an hour of patch adams , but then again , he has to . it's so obvious where this narrative is headed from the moment he enters medical school , williams offers the only spark of invention . even when contending with the hammering pathos of grinning , hairless children , he still has the ability to disarm an audience with a joke . those grinning , hairless children do bode ill for the second half , when patch adams gets serious on us . it's not just that screenwriter steve oedekerk and director tom shadyac ( who teamed up on eddie murphy's the nutty professor ) play to the most cliched devices of emotional manipulation , like a tearful speech over a grave and a pedantic speech in a courtroom setting . what's worse is that they don't understand when _not_ to resort to emotional manipulation . instead of allowing the scene any sort of sensitivity or dignity , they turn it into a romantic interlude , complete with marc shaiman's obtrusive , syrupy underscore ( shaiman's work should be declared a health risk for diabetics ) . patch adams not only dares you not to be uplifted , it jams a forklift under your seat and slowly grinds you into the ceiling of the theater . i know plenty of viewers will be amused enough by williams' antics to consider patch adams worthwhile . i know plenty of viewers will be applauding patch sticking it to big medicine as the end credits roll . patch adams is a calculated , carefully constructed response machine , unencumbered by complexities like making the traditional doctors anything more than ogres . true story or no , this is a vehicle for robin williams as we've known him best and loved him most . he's the non-conformist ready to quip you into submission . . . except that he appears all-too-willing to conform to formulaic roles in formulaic films . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1302,"director : steven zaillian . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity ) running time : 118 minutes . for those unfamiliar with the american legal system -- and count it among your blessings if you are one of them -- it is not generally the stuff of which great drama is made . it is a thing of motions , pleadings , depositions and causes of action , of hundreds of hours spent reading thousands of incoming documents , or redacting thousands of outgoing documents . it is a war of attrition played out in conference rooms , only rarely involving tense attorney-witness confrontations or even-more-tense waits for a verdict . cinematic law is a satisfying fiction ; real law is , for the most part , a laborious game of chicken before an out-of-court settlement . there was every reason to believe that , if anyone could lend a spark to slogging through the legal mire , it would be steven zaillian . this was , after all , the director who made chess both kinetic and poetic in searching for bobby fischer . unfortunately , it pulls all its punches when it comes to giving the story an emotional hook . schlichtmann's conversion from shark to softy is supposed to anchor the film , except that it's far too subtle . in fact , travolta often plays schlichtmann as though his concern is always still about the money , his frustration less about letting his clients down than about letting the big one slip away -- which , frankly , is a more interesting choice . as the film slowly becomes the story of how the woburn case drains all the cash out of schlichtmann and his firm , it slowly drains what little narrative and visual energy it had . certainly much of that energy was supposed to be provided by robert duvall as jerry facher , beatrice's eccentric veteran attorney . i suppose the idea is that he's wily because he passes himself off as such a goof , but the character's tics -- taping up an ancient briefcase covered in snagglepuss decals ; absently bouncing a ball during a phone conversation ; obsessing over the red sox -- are more often distracting than they are entertaining . at least duvall's fussy colorfulness , along with william h . macy's less-mannered breakdown as schlichtmann's nervous accountant , give you something to watch . too often a civil action feels like the sort of lecture in legal maneuvering we see facher give to students at harvard law . it runs out of gas when it runs out of things to tell us , since it lacks characters to engage us . real law makes the appeal of john grisham-esque courtroom melodrama make a lot more sense . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1304,"screenplay : willard carrol . director : willard carrol . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , sexual situations ) running time : 118 minutes . playing by heart inspires the question , "" how many stories do you need to tell in one film in order to cover the entire spectrum of human relationship dynamics ? "" the answer , of course , is that it's actually a trick question ; you can't possibly cover the subject of love in toto over the course of one two-hour feature . the best you can do is make the stories you _do_ choose to tell compelling enough and insightful enough that they feel somehow more universal . writer/director willard carrol , apparently unhip to the tricky nature of the aforementioned question , has answered it "" six . "" and that's at _least_ two too many . there's an inherent danger in films that include several intertwining stories , namely that some will be much more interesting than others , and that the interesting stories will be less effective because we keep dashing away from them . at least one of the stories is extremely effective -- anderson and stewart's tentative sparring -- thanks largely to the charismatic intelligence of the two actors . two others are consistently diverting -- jolie and phillippe , and connery and rowlands -- again thanks largely to the performers , which is a particular surprise in the former case . but with three other stories vying for time , including the utterly tedious trysts between stowe and edwards , there's never enough time for the good ones to build any momentum . carrol and usually reliable editor pietro scalia ( an oscar-winner for jfk ) chop playing by heart into bite-sized three minute chunklets , giving the film all the emotional resonance of a wittier-than-usual episode of "" the love boat . "" that wittiness is what carrol is counting on to carry us through playing by heart , a film with more than its share of effective verbal sparring and clever quips . the dialogue makes the episodes diverting a fair amount of the time ; it also disguises a script that has virtually nothing interesting or new to say about relationships . it often feels like carrol is engaged in a decade-late scramble for a "" modern "" take on love and sex -- incorporating hiv into not one but two of the storylines -- but essentially every one of the stories is about people trying to understand and be understood . it's not a particularly revelatory take on why love is complicated , which makes it even more unclear why carrol had to tell so many stories to say one thing . perhaps it's the sense that carrol is trying _so_ hard that makes playing by heart frustrating in spite of its occasional sparks of life . john barry's score drapes a curtain of strings heavily over too many scenes , vilmos zsigmond's cinematography paints an unbelievably romanticized l . a . nightscape , and the conversations sometimes turn into exchanges that in real life would end with someone getting smacked across the face . yet for all its flaws , playing by heart probably would have worked if it had given us the time to build a familiarity with only one or two couples , allowing us to understand their hopes and fears about love in more depth than a quick character capsule could provide . the moments just don't add up in this epic of the heart that proves the law of diminishing returns . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1305,"the conventional three-act film storytelling structure may not be sacrosanct , but if you're telling a conventional story , it's a really good idea to use it . marketing sets up the audience to expect a specific conflict for the second act , and to expect that certain characters and relationships will be the focal points ; familiarity with other films tells them those elements will appear before they've finished their bags of popcorn . if you give the people what they expect when they're expecting it , you're going to satisfy them nine times out of ten . blast from the past is set up as a romance and a fish-out-of-water comedy , and eventually it is both . it simply takes foooorrreeeeevvveerr to get there . a sensible film-maker would have realized that the webbers' life in the shelter was the set-up for the story , not the story itself . the whole business is handled clumsily , though ; like adam himself , the film waits so long to begin doing the things it should have been doing much earlier , it appears unsure how to do them . how much better spent that first half hour might have been if the real world juxtaposition had been eve's childhood rather than the pointless slotnik character , both for comedic social commentary potential and for plot development purposes . but no such luck -- blast from the past often feels like an assembly-line product made by people who've never seen an assembly line . blast from the past does have its charms , enough not to make the experience completely frustrating . wilson brings a silly energy to the second half of the film , giving it enough cute moments to make it watchable , but he never pulls it all together in a way that's completely satisfying . blast from the past is a pretty lousy execution of a fairly simple idea , a textbook case of a by-the-numbers plot that just doesn't add up . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"" capital punishment had been reduced to a plot device for a by-the-numbers crowd-pleaser . in hollywood , _that's_ reality . on the surface , true crime appears to be something a bit more highbrow , but it's still a frustrating gloss over a sensitive subject . true crime is naturally more everett's story than anyone else's , which might lead you to expect that he's the character who will learn , grow and change , especially since he has enough character flaws to fill a week's worth of jerry springer episodes . instead , eastwood doesn't even pretend that everett's crusade is about anything more than salvaging a shred of his professional dignity . the role is surprisingly flat , leading to a narrative where all that matters is the plot progression towards beachum's midnight deadline . beachum's final hours with his wife and daughter are given a lot of screen time -- perhaps to deflect the perception that this is yet another movie about a white man finding salvation through helping anonymous non-white characters -- yet those scenes serve primarily to tangle the film's themes . if we're watching beachum's torment simply to give everett's story a face , it's a trivialization of that suffering . and if we're watching to build sympathy for an innocent man , than a late twist which suggests beachum might be guilty is a manipulative cheat . the film plunges us into one side of the capital punishment debate when it serves its purpose , then tiptoes around the edges of the issue at other times to avoid the appearance of making a controversial statement . ironically , it's only the fact that true crime is a slick hollywood star project that makes it fairly watchable . eastwood once again gathers wonderful technical support -- cinematographer jack n . green , composer lennie niehaus , production designer henry bumstead -- to create impressive atmosphere . he also draws a slick supporting performance from james woods' as everett's crass editor-in-chief , a role which makes you wonder whether woods and denis leary accidentally swapped scripts but the result turned out perfectly . the buildup to everett's down-to-the-wire race to find exonerating evidence will probably work on you in spite of your resistance , but ultimately it's clear that eastwood's craftsmanship is disguising a genuinely weightless story . true crime is true hollywood , a disposable entertainment that toys with earnest respectability before turning into a chase thriller where the traffic is a bitch . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1311,"life is funny sometimes . . . just not as often as you might expect . universal is promoting life just the way you'd expect it to promote a film starring eddie murphy and martin lawrence -- as a raucous comedy with plenty of the insult humor , attitude and gay-baiting their target audience has come to expect . the funny thing is -- or isn't , as the case may be -- that life is actually an attempt by the two comedians to grow up a little . it's a commendable effort by two performers best known for more simple-minded material ; it's just not a very successful one . the pacing may be a bit pokey , but it still looks and smells like a mass-market comedy for a while . that's before screenwriters robert ramsey and matthew stone and director ted demme start taking some intriguing detours . as life unfolds , it starts to feel surprisingly ambitious , not at all like a whoop-it-up crowd-pleaser . as admirable as life's reach may be , however , it generally exceeds its grasp . while it lays out the sub-plots and advancing years like an epic in the making , the film-makers never appear entirely committed to making a film that could alienate many of the stars' core fans . life is a frustrating experience , because every time it appears close to making a connection to its characters it falls back on a lame joke to reassure the viewers that they're still watching a comedy . i may be kinder to life than it really deserves , simply because i was so surprised by its tone . martin lawrence , whose screen work has generally bordered on the insufferable , does some fairly nice work as the straight man in the duo , and murphy is in fine form as his quintessential fast talker . life is effective in bits and pieces , building on the predictable comedy in some unexpected ways . it just never builds on them in the necessary ways , never making the friendship between ray and claude its primary dramatic concern . it's a film caught between what the film-makers wanted to do and what the studio must have wanted them to do , just the clashing creation you'd expect from a story that's part stir crazy and part shawshank redemption . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1312,"credit 20th century fox marketing with a first in my tenure as a critic : along with the press notes for pushing tin , they included a copy of the source material . it was a superb piece of reportage turned into a compelling story . there may be a great film to be made from that story , but pushing tin isn't it . for about the first half hour , and sporadically thereafter , pushing tin is actually about the high-pressure world of air traffic controllers . director mike newell employs computer graphics effectively to get us inside how controllers see their domain , and keeps up a brisk pace to match the frantic energy of the characters . meanwhile , writers glen & les charles ( co-creators of "" cheers "" ) do a nice job with the camaraderie and gallows humor that keeps everyone sane . in fact , just about everything is right with pushing tin except its central storyline . cusack and thornton are such talented actors that it might take longer than usual to register that their conflict has virtually nothing to do with the world of air traffic controllers . there was a mini-series' worth of psychological material in darcy frey's article , but pushing tin instead chooses the mundane head-butting of nick and russell , combined with smirky seductions and marital squabbles . it's a conflict that appears to have been pasted over this backdrop by people who had no idea what to do with it for a major studio film except tell a generic studio film story . there's no reason for pushing tin to be a film about rival air traffic controllers if this was the story they were going to tell ; it could just as easily be a film about rival matadors , or rival insurance salesmen , or rival periodontists . the lack of a solid center really shows in the final 45 minutes , when the film falls apart completely . there's a bumpy flight , a bomb scare , a zen immersion in a mountain stream and a showdown with jet engines , none of which makes the characters more than the broad sketches they've been from the start . that'll teach fox to give us a glimpse into what might have been . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1313,"if i were writing a film project for myself , i can't say i wouldn't include a scene where i got to kiss sophie marceau . that's the thing about a commercial art form like film -- sometimes it's difficult to separate your emotions from your better judgment . david spade has proven himself extremely funny as a certain kind of character in a certain kind of context , and he's extremely funny again in lost & found when he decides to be that character in those contexts . leaving aside for a moment the improbable pairing of the elfin spade and the porcelain marceau , lost & found actually has a number of solid comic moments , assuming you're in tune with spade's routine . much of lost & found , however , suggests that he either doesn't know his own strengths or doesn't trust them to carry a film . in fact , spade and his co-writers often seem desperate to make viewers like the film by association with other films . the traumas to which dylan inadvertently subjects the dog evoke thoughts of there's something about mary , as does the musical closing credits sequence . spade never seems comfortable with dumbed-down material , but he's present for such comic delights as a foraging expedition through a mountain of dog droppings and a poker game with a quartet of elderly women who -- hilariously enough -- have dirty minds , dirty mouths and flatulence problems . when lost & found fumbles to connect with viewers through idiocy rather than spade's intelligence , it flounders . it also flounders when trying to make spade a romantic comedy protagonist . director jeff pollack tries hard to convince us that dylan can be a sensitive guy , but the attempts fall dreadfully flat . you just know that every time dylan has to make nice-nice with lila he'd rather be cutting loose with another put-down , which makes marceau's performance all the more impressive for making it seem remotely plausible that lila would fall for this guy . lost & found has its moments when david spade does what he does best , or when he brings on jon lovitz for a cameo as a "" dog whisperer .

1314,"screenplay : david cronenberg . producers : robert lantos , andras hamori and david cronenberg . director : david cronenberg . mpaa rating : r ( violence , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 97 minutes . david cronenberg's existenz may be as thematically dense a film as we'll see all year . it touches on the nature of reality , and the ways we seek to escape it and embrace it at the same time . it addresses issues of violence in the media , as well as the nature of constructing a work of fiction . it's a cautionary tale , and a caution against excessive caution . it's a social satire , and even a self-satire . it's also , ultimately , a sinkhole for narrative and characterization . cronenberg has created an emotionally weightless intellectual exercise that's fun to parse but little fun to watch . if you know your cronenberg ( videodrome , the fly , crash ) at all , you know that you're entering a decidedly freaky realm . those same viewers may also find themselves wrapped up in deconstructing cronenberg's various messages . the design of the game pods -- which none-too-subtly resemble a compilation of erogenous zones -- turns into a poke at the masturbatory nature of video games , while allegra's writhing response to "" plugging in "" adds drug addiction to the metaphorical layering . the story treats us to characters who commit violence in the real world while thinking they're still in a game world -- a creepy , timely commentary on the influence of pop culture violence -- then takes a swipe at the actions of the neo-luddite anti-game faction . perhaps most amusingly , existenz plays with how characters behave in a fictional world , extending by implication to the plot-advancing conventions in film itself . there's enough sub-text in existenz to keep a viewer well-occupied for its 97 minutes . if only cronenberg had bothered to bring along any actual text to flesh out that subtext . existenz plays out like a scholarly analysis of itself , a cinematic cliff's notes for a novel that doesn't actually exist . leigh and law are as purely functional in their roles as their characters are in their game-roles , and while cronenberg may find that little meta-joke amusing , for a viewer it's merely distracting . by the time the plot of existenz starts folding in on itself ( leading to a revelation that's not at all revelatory if you've been paying attention ) , you may find yourself wondering why you should care about any of it . cronenberg is as stylistically distinctive a film-maker as we have in this cookie-cutter era , but he's locked himself into a rut of message-filled visions with no human connection . existenz plays out like a hallucinatory letter to the editor . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1315,"i'll be honest with you : the last thing i was expecting from the paramount-distributed trekkies was a warts-n-all documentary about "" star trek "" fandom . roger nygard's trekkies , however , is about as far from an officially endorsed whitewash as one could imagine . in fact , though its character studies are at times undeniably amusing , it's almost too focused on turning its subjects into the oddballs everyone already suspects trekkies of being . the bad news for many "" trek "" fans expecting a sympathetic portrait is that those two characters are among the more mainstream folks in the film . when the subject matter swerves into the pornographic fan fiction which has been created using "" trek "" characters , it no longer feels like nygard is just creating a comprehensive catalog of the manifestations of trekkie-ism . there's an element of side show exploitation to these aspects of trekkies , a sense that nygard is less interested in understanding the phenomenon of trekkies than in turning their eccentricities into punch lines . that's truly a shame , because the "" why's "" of trekkies could have been at least as fascinating as the "" who's "" . in an utterly unique way , the universe created by gene roddenberry affected viewers as no other television program has in the history of the medium . trekkies also touches on the impact of the show's positive portrayal of multi-ethnic integration , and on the optimism of its messages of inclusion and acceptance . such ideas should have made it easier to see trekkies as social outsiders who have embraced a mythology in which they are tolerated , and even celebrated . it's ironic -- and somewhat disappointing -- to watch the film turn them into social outsiders once again . there's no denying that trekkies is occasionally quite funny , whether in the answers of cast members to the strangest fan experiences they have had , or in the ways various trekkies have integrated their love of "" trek "" into their lives ( like dentist dennis bourguignon's "" starbase dental "" office ) . it was only after i left the theater that i realized i had been laughing at these people more than i was laughing with them . yes , there are comments about how intelligent most "" star trek "" fans are ; it's too bad they feel like token gestures . many trekkies themselves seem to have embraced the film , but i'm not sure they should appreciate the way they are turned into exactly what the broader population generally thinks of them . there's not enough balance between the unusual things these people do and the love that inspires them to do those things . it was brave of paramount to endorse a film like trekkies . it also seems like a bit of a betrayal . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1316,"screenplay : george lucas . director : george lucas . mpaa rating : pg ( violence ) running time : 131 minutes . in one sense , of course , episode i - the phantom menace is the ultimate can't-lose proposition . it's also the ultimate can't-win proposition , a monolith nearly impossible to separate from the ridiculous expectations . curiously , critics face a similar predicament . a rave could be interpreted as succumbing to the hype , while a jeer could be viewed as anti-hype backlash . how do you talk about a film that virtually demands the creation of a new set of rules -- for the film-maker , for the media , for the audience ? and transported i was . . . into a hard drive . there are plenty of other plot fragments floating around in the phantom menace -- most of them involving political machinations -- but the ho-hum plotting may actually be the least of its flaws . quite simply , this is a film devoid of personality , filled with characters who never inspire affection or close identification . star wars , for all its dazzle , had three fundamentally solid characters at its core : conflicted hero-on-a-quest luke ; tough , no-nonsense leia ; and lovable rogue han . it's almost funny to hear qui-gon described as rebellious , since he seems about as capable of a rash act as he is of cracking a smile . there may be heroes in the phantom menace , but there's really no one to like . and , for that matter , there's really no one to hate . darth sidious , the sith who will be emperor , is the primary villain of the piece , yet he only appears in the form of a jittery transmission , hardly the stuff of genuine menace . darth maul , meanwhile -- he of the marketing-friendly day-glo visage -- is effective considering his limited screen time , yet he's really a glorified henchman for all his double-bladed lightsaber tricks . the phantom menace is missing that unifying , ultimately hissable bad guy that makes for great archetypal conflict . what we do have is a triumph of art direction and technology which creates alien worlds like no film ever has before . though the pacing of the opening hour is on the pokey side -- which places it in good company with the first star wars -- lucas eventually produces a few dynamic set pieces like the desert pod race . when the phantom menace goes for pure visual satisfaction , it usually delivers . ultimately , though , there's a more basic satisfaction the film lacks . its structure and imagery are reminiscent both of star wars and return of the jedi -- particularly the latter in its three-ring climax -- but it doesn't even achieve jedi's level of old-fashioned fantasy fulfillment . when gungans and battle droids clash on the fields of naboo , every last figure a digital concoction , you begin to sense the absence of a primally appealing human story in this blockbuster . for now , all that remains is spectacle without resonance , without magic , without even all that much fun if you happen to be over the age of 10 . the result is an adventure that feels . . . well , see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1321,"there are plenty of strange , ironic and otherwise inexplicable things about hollywood filmmaking in the 1990s , but among the more puzzling is the way it treats "" star power . "" in the glory days of the studio system , hollywood packaged stars together in whatever material was available at the time , always conscious of the fact that audiences would come out to see certain actors do little more than model wardrobe . plenty of films exist primarily to be glossy star packages , but the studios treat that fact as a dirty little secret . in these post-modern , indie-hip cinematic times of ours , it has become unfashionable to admit that sometimes we just like to see attractive people doing attractive things . that's the only explanation for the thomas crown affair , a star package so overwhelmingly glossy you may need to shield your eyes from the glare . the thomas crown affair follows in the fine tradition of the original 1968 version , which itself existed largely as a star vehicle for steve mcqueen and faye dunaway . the scenery , from the nightspots of the manhattan jet set to the tropical islands to which that set jets , is lovingly photographed . director john mctiernan steps back from die hard-style pacing to establish a moderate , almost jazzy tempo for the too-cool characters and situations . brosnan , who probably emerged from the womb in a freshly pressed tuxedo , squints in a manly fashion ; russo , attempting to do for women's underwear what clark gable did for t-shirts , does the little black dress thing with slinky appeal . teflon should only be this slick . plenty of viewers will undoubtedly find themselves carried away by this fantasia for beautiful people . i might even have been among them if the thomas crown affair hadn't grown so angst-y and redundant . it's an early signal that the film is going to play the "" sure , they're beautiful people , but they've got feelings too "" card . it's entertaining enough to watch as crown and banning circle each other , each one thinking he or she is the manipulator rather than the manipulatee . russo plays the final half hour with such overwrought gravity that you'd think her decision whether or not to turn crown in made her hamlet to his polonius . i find myself in an awkward position as i criticize the thomas crown affair , because ultimately i fault it for trying to work in some subtext . plenty of films could use a healthy injection of subtext , mind you -- or the vaugest hint of a text , even -- but this film isn't one of them . it fairly screams out to be treated as a caper , with crown and banning spending their time trying to out-think each other rather than out-emote each other . there's just too much earnestness to the way they play it . by trying to play a 1940s story with 1990s emotional realism , the filmmakers miss the fantasy we're looking for when we watch two movie stars together in a movie that , ultimately , is about two movie stars together . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1322,"albert brooks has always been a filmmaker who couldn't resist a great high concept . an inspired , outrageous situation has provided brooks with the spark to show his characters -- notably himself -- coming to terms with themselves and finding a little dignity . his concepts fueled the gags , but he never forgot to tell a story . the muse seems to have been born as yet another hollywood satire , poking fun at the insecurities of movie folk and ther fascination with the latest insta-cure for what ails them personally or professionally . the insider gags , unfortunately , are about the only ones that work . more often , the muse is a comedy in search of something , _anything_ funny to say . sharon stone's finicky diva is an idea that never quite takes off , and the supporting players often look vaguely bored with their lines . even brooks' usually reliable persona can't jump-start the film , because it doesn't turn into a sympathetic character . he's just an annoyed privileged guy whose annoyance at his slightly lessened privilege makes him just plain annoying . brooks' lack of a character is part of the over-riding problem with the muse : a lack of anything substantial past the thin premise . the film occasionally looks like it could be leading stephen towards a little growing up , whether about his career neuroses or his retro-breadwinner agitation at laura's growing financial success as a cookie-maker . there's even the faint hope that brooks could be offering a light-hearted look at the shove people require just to believe in their own talents . then the film ends , and it becomes evident that there's not a shred of actual story to the muse . there's no improved mutual understanding in the phillips' relationship , no one grows , no one learns a thing -- there's not even the satisfaction of sarah explaining her own turns of character . the whole thing just fades to black , leaving a shallow collection of industry jokes in its wake . there are a few decent laughs to be found in brooks' validation of william goldman's line about how "" nobody knows anything "" in hollywood . mark feuerstein has a nicely understated role as a tactless studio executive , and steven wright appears briefly as the nepotistically- advantaged stan spielberg . but much of the acidic humor leaves a sour aftertaste once it's clear that it's all little more than a chance for brooks to vent . his character spends much of the film in search of a third act for his screenplay , which is ironic when you consider that the muse is in desperate need of a third act of its own . it's even more ironic that in the middle of a hollywood satire , the protagonist's brilliant script -- the one he's inspired to write after being told he has "" lost [his] edge "" -- is a wacky high-concept vehicle for jim carrey . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1323,"in this summer of uniquely adult suspense fare like the blair witch project and the sixth sense , the astronaut's wife initially seems like a promising companion piece . there's certainly an aura of familiarity to the story , but that almost seems to work for the build-up of suspense . everything about the astronaut's wife aims for an ever-growing sense of menace -- ravich's odd camera angles , time-lapses and slow motions ; cinematographer allen daviau's murky photography ; production designer jan roelfs' sterile interiors . technically , there's a lot to like about the astronaut's wife and the way it keeps a viewer unsteady and uneasy . as a narrative however , nearly everything seems just ever-so-slightly off . the film feels like it starts too late , eventually revealing crucial pieces of armacost family history that really should have been shown to us . individual scenes flow smoothly , but the transitions between them are awkward and abrupt . characters who seem like they should play a much more significant role flit in and out of the story inconsistently . ravich doesn't seem entirely in control of the pace , letting the film ooze along eerily without ever knowing where to crank it up or tone it down . the familiar "" devil inside "" plot elements are played deadly straight , creating the impression that ravich is taking his story far too seriously . even the key moments of exposition drift by so deliberately they're gone before you have a chance to register that they might be important . the astronaut's wife spends 106 minutes convincing you that it's just about to turn into something compelling , then never does . the performances and characters are certainly a significant part of the problem . like the rest of the story , the characters feel incomplete . depp plays the post-close encounter spencer with a disquieting flatness , but we see too little of spencer the good guy to make the transition unsettling . theron has already proven in the devil's advocate that she knows how to play frantic and tormented , but again there's a back-story missing from her performance ( though it's dropped into the dialogue ) . ravich keeps building the astronaut's wife as though the plight of the characters is going to elevate the genre story , when ultimately the characters don't mean a thing . i must admit that i was startled to find the astronaut's wife remotely watchable when it appeared without preview screenings . the look of the film is nearly enough , combined with theron's haunted stares , to make it linger in your head for a while . it just doesn't deliver on the most basic level , leaving you itchy and unsatisfied as though you had just watched a film that wasn't quite finished yet . there are too many other , better choices for viewers who want a little substance with their chills . after you get through admiring the style of the astronaut's wife , all you're left with is a lot of empty space . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1325,"screenplay : lawrence kasdan . producers : charles okun and lawrence kasdan . director : lawrence kasdan . mpaa rating : r ( adult themes , drug use , profanity , nudity , sexual situations ) running time : 111 minutes . lawrence kasdan has grown to adore narrative sprawl . he attracted wonderful actors because he wrote wonderful parts , but he seemed little interested in making those parts part of a whole . sometimes ( the big chill , silverado , grand canyon ) those untamed scripts still turned into satisfying episodic films ; sometimes ( the accidental tourist , wyatt earp ) they turned into meandering acting showcases . mumford , kasdan's latest exercise in free-form ensemble , has the germ of a great story at the core of his narrative . . . and he promptly drowns that germ in the pencillin of his herky-jerky directing . though his therapy brings results , his credentials aren't exactly conventional either . it takes a while before kasdan spills all the beans about doc mumford's back story , but by then you can already see everything that's right and everything that's wrong about mumford . on the plus side -- predictably for a kasdan film -- is the cast , filled with appealing character performers . loren dean's low-key , natural delivery is perfect for the no-nonsense doc mumford , jason lee shows a sweetness far more convincing than it was in kissing a fool , and the radiant hope davis lends her unique gifts to sofie , the chronically fatigued patient for whom doc mumford falls . kasdan drops these characters into the kind of bucolic , milkman-served town that would appeal to anyone looking for a fresh start . it's the ideal set-up for a comic romance with complications . but mumford isn't a comic romance with complications , at least not often enough . though the actors are all fine , their characters are a huge distraction . kasdan certainly needs to show doc mumford's gift for helping people , but he includes far too many such scenes . in the process , he loses track of mumford's backbone , creating a film that bumps along with virtually no flow . that lack of momentum is most evident when it becomes clear that mumford's payoff will be a relationship between mumford and sofie . there are a couple of perfectly charming scenes between dean and davis , but there's no way to anticipate that the film is leading up to a choice based on those scenes . mumford more often plays as a subtle jab at therapy , suggesting that a really good listener who knows something about overcoming troubles is all an unhappy soul really needs . that's an interesting enough concept , but it doesn't exactly make for a satisfying story ; watching doc mumford's patient list hijack the film only emphasizes that mumford should have been about the doctor . the saying goes that there are no small parts , only small actors . lawrence kasdan seems to agree . . . to a fault . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1326,"director : ang lee . while watching the wedding banquet ( currently in limited release ) , i found myself thinking that it would have a very good short . this taiwanese-american comedy about generational and cultural conflict has fifty minutes of genuine energy stretched into an hour and fifty minute film . there are moments of real charm and insight , but ultimately the sluggish pace doesn't hold them together . ma and pa gao get a wedding , wei-wei gets a green card , and wei-tung gets a welcome tax write-off . complications . there are several thematic threads in the wedding banquet , all with interesting possibilities . foremost , there is the issue of living up to parental expectations which have nothing to do with who you are as a person . this latter area receives the most attention , but like the others it is given somewhat short shrift . director and co-scripter ang lee seems to want his film to be about too many different things , without giving sufficient attention to any of them . there are , as i've noted , some very clever set pieces . these individual moments almost add up , but they don't quite . much of the responsibility for this lack of engagement falls on the shoulders of the two male leads . chao , a first time actor , never invests wei-tung with any real depth . lichtenstein too is far too wooden , making simon's genuine frustration over having to hide himself come off as simple petulance . fortunately , there are good performances to somewhat balance theirs , most notably lung , who does some wonderful physical acting , and may lin , who sparkles as wei-wei . unfortunately , her character is sadly underwritten , as are most of the roles . the lulls in the pace would have been acceptable had strong characters been present to pull me along , but i was simply never caught up enough in their lives . it's difficult not to recommend the wedding banquet , since it's heart seems so firmly in the right place . it has its moments , and the themes of familial conflict may strike a chord with many viewers . however , i just never found myself caring quite enough , and i found myself looking at my watch too frequently .

1327,"screenplay : kurt luedtke , from darryl ponsican's adaptation of the novel by warren adler . director : sydney pollack . mpaa rating : r ( adult themes , profanity , sexual situations ) running time : 131 minutes . for a romantic drama , random hearts sure doesn't begin the way you would expect . the pacing may be slow , but the set-up is engrossing and effective . to understand what's so dreadful about the romantic story in random hearts , you have to understand the laughter . and the audience starts howling . you could argue that they were responding to the awkwardness of the moment , but i'm not sure i'd buy it . in a matter of seconds , it was obvious that people weren't buying that relationship . doomed romanced between wounded , grieving souls are nothing new in dramatic cinema -- case in point : last tango in paris -- but such films generally focus on the essential emptiness at the center of the relationship . random hearts has too old-time-hollywood a sensibility to delve into that kind of psychological pain . scenes between dutch and kay keep suggesting the potential for genuine affection between them , something besides the mutual despair and betrayal that connected them in the first place . when harrison ford -- looking a bit silly in his stud earring -- says to her , "" i was thinking about your mouth , "" you have to believe kay would have laughed in his face . of course people in hollywood love stories are always saying ridiculously purple things to one another , and audiences roll with it all the time . it can only work , however , if the story is builty on one of those sweeping archetypal premises in which soulmates are inspired to rhapsodic poetry . random hearts shouldn't have had the faintest whiff of soulmates to it , not when the hook is the visceral response of two people to an affair between their spouses . pollack is too polished and professional a film-maker to produce an unwatchable product ; he's also too polished and professional a film-maker to delve into those dark places where the film needed to live . by the time the smiling , optimistic denouement rolls around , you know the audience was right when their gut response to this relationship was to laugh out loud . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1328,"director : wes craven . mpaa rating : pg ( mild profanity , adult themes ) running time : 118 minutes . it was a heartfelt appeal , and i was surprised to find the film evoking a heartfelt response . i responded passionately to the narrow-minded administrative mandates that , in times of budgetary constraint , describe the arts and music in public schools as "" extra , "" or not part of a "" core curriculum . "" and my heart was lightened at the sights and sounds of children making beautiful music . i'll willingly make the following admission , gentle readers : i found myself getting misty-eyed during music of the heart . i follow this admission with one of a different sort , the sort that makes viewers everywhere want to throttle critics within an inch of their thumb-turning , star-distributing lives : music of the heart , moving though it may be , just isn't a particularly good film . then those nasty budget cuts begin rearing their ugly head , forcing roberta to find creative funding solutions . there's no denying the fundamental emotional appeal of a story like this one . hollywood has always loved "" inspirational teacher "" films , and there have been plenty of them : the miracle worker ; to sir , with love ; conrack ; dead poets society ; stand and deliver ; lean on me ; mr . holland's opus ; dangerous minds ; etc . in recent years they have become even more prevalent -- perhaps indicative of how much more complicated teaching has become -- as well as more rigidly formulaic . the ultimate disappointment of music of the heart has little to do with its predictability ; on the contrary , like many films of its kind it hits its emotional high notes even though you know exactly where they're going to come . no , the disappointment in music of the heart comes from a strangely fragmented narrative that never quite commits to a central story . the film occasionally explores the juxtaposition of guaspari's background and that of her students , but the intrusions of social problems in the kids' lives are lurching and token pieces of "" reality "" -- a child of separated parents here , a victim of a drive-by shooting there , an instance of domestic abuse thrown in for good measure . when the story starts winding its way into guaspari's experiment with blind dating , you have to wonder if director wes craven has any sense for its focus . there's no question it was a pivotal moment in the history of guaspari's program , nor is there any question the carnegie hall benefit concert -- featuring big name performers like isaac stern , itzhak perlman and arnold steinhardt -- makes for a rousing finish . it just doesn't feel like part of the same film . stand and deliver reached its natural conclusion with the first successful ap exam ; music of the heart tags on a 45-minute coda after guaspari's first successful concert . of course there are several touching moments in that final 45 minutes , and throughout the film . unfortunately , however , it's the ideas alone that are touching , not the way the film presents them . it's easy to be moved by the sentiments expressed in streep and estefan's introductory clip . it's harder to be moved by a story that lets the mere concept of an "" inspirational teacher "" film do all the work . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1329,"i have a confession to make which may compromise my integrity as a reviewer ( if that isn't an oxymoron ) : i wanted the good son to be horrible . * really * horrible . i've grown so tired of macaulay culkin's yelping mug and the highly-publicized power grabs by his manager-dad , that i wanted him to be wholly responsible for a colossal failure . well , the good son isn't horrible ; it's merely mediocre , which may be worse . at least a truly awful thriller can provoke campy laughs . all the good son provoked in me was boredom . i had very little problem with the basic premises of the good son . the problems with the good son are almost entirely in the execution . the film waits far too long , nearly a third of its running time , before introducing us to henry , setting up mark's guilt and showing off desert scenery . there's no time for the menace to build slowly , or for the early pranks to be tame enough so that mark could get a bit caught up in them himself . ian mcewan's script seemed to need another draft and earlier plot points . the performances are also a big problem . elijah wood is fine , a good young actor forced to spend most of this film making his eyes as wide as possible . his relatives , however , don't fare as well . we're never specifically told how long it has been since the death of the other son , and that would have helped . as it is , wallace seems perfectly recovered , while susan appears simply melancholy , striking bronte-esque poses on a seaside promontory . this is also parly the fault of a performance by culkin lacking in subtlety . instead of the straightforward tone of a true sociopath , culkin adopts the wide-eyed , solemn , sing-song style any parent would instantly recognize as a child lying . it's homicidal that he hasn't quite mastered . if there's one surprising culprit in the good son's failings , it's director joseph ruben . but the good son goes everywhere you expect it to go , exactly when you expect it . it's a competent but cut-and-paste directing job , providing the minimum recommended allowance of suspense . i never groaned out loud , but i never felt any real tension , either . the good son is not a complete failure . it's the kind of thriller where you might jump once , then wonder why you fell for * that * old bit . and as reluctant as i am to admit it , culkin shows that he might be more than a one-trick pony given a little seasoning . it just might be a good idea if his next trick is something original .

1330,"screenplay : alvin sargent , based on the novel by mona simpson . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity ) running time : 114 minutes . for a long time during anywhere but here , my attention was fixed somewhere i didn't quite expect . relationship dramas like this tend to be all about character and performance -- every scene is an actor's scene , every moment is an actor's moment . but to my surprise , i became fascinated with the way the film looked . the grainy film stock renders everything slightly fuzzy ; the bleached colors suck the golden glow out of tinseltown . i mean no disrespect to mr . deakins or to the craft of cinematography when i say that , even at the time , i knew anywhere but here couldn't have been working the way it was supposed to if i was paying attention to the choice of film stock . it's been done before , of course -- even the kooky mother and more stable daughter has been done before , in films like mermaids -- but solid writing and strong performances can often counteract familiarity . anywhere but here does come through with the strong performances . their scenes together effectively capture the perpetual tension between ann and adele , and do a particularly nice job of showing ann's frustration at being the real grown-up of the two while never turning her into a wise-ass . and that may be why anywhere but here feels so claustrophobic and artificial . we see ann walking uncomfortably through beverly hills high on her first day of school , but there's no sense of her struggle before she's giggling away with girlfriends ; a few scattered scenes of adele in her job as a speech pathologist/therapist provides no sense for why this flighty woman ever got into a field that demands so much patience . most disappointing , there's far too little background on their lives in wisconsin for us to understand why adele wants to leave and ann wants to stay , and far too little development of the potentially intriguing relationship between ann and her almost-kissing-cousin benny ( shawn hatosy ) . there's really not a single strong supporting character anywhere but here can bounce off of . it's no wonder these two drive each other crazy -- they've been hermetically sealed away from the rest of the world . one could argue that such an isolated , in-each-other's-face relationship is precisely the point of anywhere but here -- that ann and adele have nothing in the world but each other , crazy-making as they may be to each other . that doesn't make it any easier to spend two hours with them -- and only them -- and their conflicts , well-acted though they may be . and of course there was the cinematography , which -- while thematically appropriate -- also reminded me what anywhere but here was missing . this is a drama too lacking in background color . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1331,"screenplay : neal purvis & robert wade and bruce feirstein . director : michael apted . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , adult themes ) running time : 128 minutes . after 40 years and 19 films , the james bond series is a cinematic institution -- perhaps even the last cinematic institution . in a film industry climate where the object of big-budget movies is generally to show the audience something new and dazzling , the bond series is all about structural stability . you know you'll get a show-stopping stunt sequence to kick things off . you know that stunt sequence will lead into opening credits filled with writhing female silhouettes . you know bond will fire off a few ghastly puns aimed at q's latest gadgets . you attend because there's something comforting about knowing it will taste the same every time . it's a recipe you don't want to see shaken or stirred . in a sense , there's little to say about the world is not enough that hasn't already been said about the 18 installments that have preceded it . it similarly goes without saying that there's a villain bent on mass destruction . it does bear mentioning that the world is not enough turns out to be a frustrating combination of the all-too-common and the distractingly absent . the film does open with a rousing pre-credits chase sequence involving motorboats racing down the thames . when bond leaps from a boat sailing through the air , catching the dangling rope on a hot air balloon in the process , there's hope that director michael apted can maintain that sort of high-flying absurdity . how many times can we thrill to bond fleeing gunmen while skiing ? how many times can a shootout in a place where every inanimate object explodes be interesting ? how many times can you wring excitement from getting caught underwater without air ? far more often , the perfunctory thrice-hourly action sequences are just there to remind you that you're watching a bond film . sometimes the reminder is necessary , because the world is not enough is otherwise short on traditional bond texture . the film may trot out locations in spain , kazakhstan , azerbaijan and turkey , but it never does anything with them , denying us the welcome pleasure of bond film as exotic travelogue . most disappointing of all is renard , who may be the least commanding villain the series has ever seen . it's bad enough that he gets only a few scenes to develop any kind of personality ; it's inexcusable that he turns out to be a self-pitying lap dog for the real villain pulling the strings . mix in the absence of a suitably unstoppable nasty henchman ( are the oddjobs and jaws's of the post-cold war world so hard to come by ? ) , and you've got a pretty vanilla thrilla . it is enjoyable to watch pierce brosnan growing into the role of bond so comfortably . connery enthusiasts may cringe , but i believe brosnan is the best all-around bond yet -- no one else has combined such convincing licensed-to-kill menace with a bon vivant twinkle in the eye . but when the best thing about a bond film is the acting , you know something isn't right . perhaps i've reached a point in my movie-going life where a bond film is a no-win proposition . the world is not enough -- not enough creativity , and not enough welcome nostalgia value . even for fast food , the familiar tastes too familiar , and the unfamiliar just tastes wrong . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1332,"screenplay : angelo pizzo . director : david anspaugh . here's where i get to come off like the callous , cold-hearted critic that i am . rudy is uplifting ; rudy is inspirational . it's feel-good hollywood entertainment in all its glory . it's also just not all that interesting . rudy is too diffuse , takes too long to get where it's going , and skimps on what should be its climax . rudy's primary structural flaw is that its script tries to cover too much time and too many different ( and tangential ) aspects of rudy ruettiger's story . however , i was most frustrated by what seemed to be an indecision on the part of screenwriter angelo pizzo and director david anspaugh as to where the triumph in rudy's story lies . a series of individual victories begins with rudy's inevitable acceptance to notre dame , each of which could have been a testimony to an indomitable spirit . i was glad for fortune's lecture regarding why rudy should consider himself a success , but by the end i had lost some necessary sympathy for rudy . he's quite good at bringing across rudy's earnest determination , and looks the perfect part with his solid but undersized body . unfortunately , i don't think the script gives him a firm enough grasp of rudy's character . the brief sequence showing rudy as a child doesn't do it , nor do the confrontations with his family which seem intended to do so . indeed , most of the characters suffer from such an overly broad stroke . prosky gets a couple of nice scenes , but there's not much freshness to his character either . this is a script with too many lines like , "" if i don't do this now , i won't be any good for you , or me , or anyone , "" and , "" not a day goes by that i don't regret it . "" it's the "" one from column a , one from column b "" school of sports film screenwriting . to its credit , rudy does a great job with the atmosphere of notre dame and notre dame football ; in fact , the south bend campus becomes a character more carefully developed than most of the humans . however , with such effective buildup , i was disappointed with the handling of the final game sequence . things happened far too fast , and an important shot involving rudy's last play is just badly directed . it's too bad . rudy has a great deal of energy and an interesting , improbably heroic story to tell . it's a moderately entertaining film , with a message and content appropriate for the whole family . what it lacks is focus .

1333,"the collaboration of these two individuals , along with one of the fall's most compelling trailers , gave me high hopes for fearless . it only delivered halfway . fearless contains a handful of gripping moments and one outstanding performance by bridges , but it also has some hollow interpersonal moments and a lack of focus that holds it back from real greatness . indeed , fearless maintains an intense , hypnotic energy for the first fifteen minutes , as max's odd new persona takes hold . then , rather abruptly and much to the worse , it shifts gears into fairly run-of-the-mill family drama . this tangent of the story doesn't work for two basic reasons . one , laura isn't all that interesting , and rossellini doesn't succeed in projecting any warmth or concern . second , max is such a jerk that i felt everyone would have been better off if he had just left . screenwriter rafael yglesias , adapting his novel , doesn't have the guts to really attack max's arrogance , and weir lets his christ imagery ( max probing a wound in his side ; max making mud from his saliva ) just sit there without any irony . their relationship is handled delicately , and avoids the too obvious step into romance . but again there are swings into scenes without a note of truth , like an awkwardly acted group therapy session . by the time fearless hits its wrenching climax , a flashback to the moment of the crash wonderfully scored by maurice jarre , i felt as though i had been through a ride as bumpy as the passengers on that plane had . while max klein's character may not have endeared itself to me , bridges' performance did . like he did in starman , bridges carries himself like an alien among us , but this time an alien with some smugness . this performance shores up my judgment of bridges as the best american leading actor around , and it almost holds fearless together on its own . however , fearless takes its metaphysics too seriously , and doesn't keep its eye on what works best : the reactions of two survivors to a world now seen with different eyes .

1334,"director : lasse halstrom . mpaa rating : r ( adult themes , profanity , sexual situations , violence ) running time : 125 minutes . a word of sympathy , first of all , for the marketing and publicity people at miramax films . i guarantee you i would not want the job of selling to the american public a film in which the character arc of the protagonist is completed by performing an abortion . they'll avoid the subject assiduously , of course , focusing instead on the idea that the cider house rules is about a journey to self-awareness , about learning to make complex choices , and so on , and et cetera , and yada yada , all of which is even ( more or less ) true . it's also true that john irving has no qualms about being provocative , and that he's willing to cast performing abortions in a quasi-heroic light if it serves the purpose of one of his uniquely compassionate tales . the cider house rules isn't worth avoiding simply because of that one thematic element . . . nor , unfortunately , it is particularly worth seeking out . the relationship between larch and homer is the focal point , a strange father-son connection that gives two actors intriguing material to work with . caine is particularly good as larch , playing devilish advocate regarding the harsh realities of the world . irving tries to wink at the mawkishness ( plenty of dickensian references abound ) , but director lasse hallstrom spends a bit too much time lingering on the orphans' upturned faces . for a story that's ultimately not about orphans , the opening of the cider house rules is too much about orphans . to that end , tobey maguire proves to be a marvelous homer wells . his performance is a challenging mix of innocence and experience ; his face captures both a hard life and a life lived in isolation . he's certainly the best choice for an irving protagonist since robin williams' garp , but the cider house rules still can't quite achieve irving-style magic , even with irving himself doing the script honors . the narrative meanders appropriately between homer's relationship with candy , his work with the apple-picking crew and life back at the orphanage , yet the meandering just doesn't have that whimsical sense of purpose that marks irving's novels . it is most worth noting that the cider house rules on film packs 15 years of homer's life into about a year and a half . there may be no better evidence that irving is a writer whose stories really need to be turned into mini-series . the film does do a nice job conveying the theme that "" situational morality "" need not be an epithet ; indeed , this is may be one of the most deeply radical concepts you'll see on film this year . it is there you see a glimmer of the literary irving , one of the glimmers you can see in maguire and caine . too often , though , those glimmers are obscured by conventional filmmaking . maybe those marketing folk don't have such a tough job after all . in the cider house rules , you have to work a little too hard to find irving the provocateur . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1336,"screenplay : chris mcquarrie , bryan singer and michael feit dougan . director : bryan singer . public access is an ambitious , stylish film that manages to find itself both inches from brilliance and inches from complete impenitrability . it's a dark tale of family values gone awry , and manages to establish an effective tone of simmering menace . the problems really begin when that simmer should be turning into a boil . the first half of public access is thoroughly intriguing , introducing whiley in a manner that makes it clear that something about him is not quite right , but keeps you guessing as to what exactly it is . as long as whiley remains a mystery , public access is a gripping drama . what were whiley's motivations , or do they even matter ? a climactic confrontation between whiley and a vocal critic was disappointingly short on tension , and the pivotal montage which brings the film to a close seems so deliberately opaque that it's just off-putting . viewers of public access will likely find immediate similarities to david lynch's blue velvet . director and co-writer bryan singer seems not at all shy about paying homage to influences like lynch , alan parker and the coen brothers . unfortunately , he never quite combines all these elements into a style all his own . the interjection of a couple of eccentric public access programs is jarring , and leads the viewer to believe that public access is going to be * about * cable television , which it absolutely is not . nothing in singer's direction really stands out except lingering shots of a ceiling fan and a glass of water which scream "" meaningful . "" the technical credits are superb , particularly the evocative score and taut editing , both by san jose native john ottman . i do wish to single out ron marquette's performance as a creepy triumph . he provides a solid counterpoint to the naturalistic performances of the townspeople , and his rendering of whiley pritcher almost sells public access singlehandedly . when it comes right down to it , though , access isn't accessible enough , and it doesn't sprint to the finish .

1338,"screenplay : david loughery . director : stephen herek . pejoratives all , and all suggesting something constructed in a zealously commercial fashion . that's exactly what the latest incarnation of the three musketeers is : pitch meeting filmmaking in all its overstuffed glory . what is astonishing is that something vaguely resembling entertainment emerged . thanks to a high-energy finale and a wonderfully goofy performance by oliver platt , the three musketeers narrowly avoids complete disaster . the first is that the casting has virtually nothing to do with appropriateness for the character . he appears to believe that a frown is sufficient for showing melancholia , and he delivers every line exactly the same , as though he were in dire need of more fiber in his diet . charlie sheen is a bit better for aramis , but he too is just plain under-talented . chris o'donnell turns d'artagnan into a bland puppy dog , all youthful bluster and no charisma . his lecherous grinning and campy one-liners are supposed to be amusing , but i found them merely sad . my first rule of action/adventure films--that they're only as good as their villains--once again proves true . fortunately , as uninteresting as the rest of the cast is , oliver platt is that engaging . his comic-relief porthos could have been awful , but he plays it with devilish enthusiasm . every moment he's on screen is worth watching , and the laughs he generates are as much out of the fun he is so clearly having as they are from anything in the script . the other big-time mistake is a screenplay by david loughery and direction by stephen herek that cobbles together elements that worked somewhere else , apparently under the impression that great pieces from other films would add up to another great film . we get spielberg's trademark zoom-to-closeup , and entrances and exits by richelieu , complete with billowing cape and ominous underscore , that have "" cardinal vader "" written all over them . the chase scenes and duels are lively and fun , but never seemed to be in the flow of the story . one of these duels was so reminiscent of the princess bride that two different members of the audience shouted out , "" prepare to die "" at exactly the same time . the three musketeers just doesn't hold together , often looking like it was edited together from other much better adventure films . yet for all its calculatedness , i must admit that musketeers does at least part of what it sets out to do : provide brainless mass-market adventure . after a sluggish first hour , it hits a gallop and cruises to the finish with gusto . the closing half hour is nearly non-stop action , some of it surprisingly good . perhaps most important , the kids seemed to love it . while somewhat violent , it's mostly slapstick , and appropriate for most of the family . i didn't laugh a lot , but others did , and there was some genuine applause . so go figure . the three musketeers will be compared frequently to richard lester's definitive 1974 version , which is certainly a much better film overall . disney's version doesn't pretend to aim for real wit or originality , just a big-budget , big-name piece of cotton candy . there are worse ways to spend a matinee .

1339,"screenplay : paul rudnick . director : barry sonnenfeld . there were plenty of things surrounding the first addams family film that i hated more than the film itself : its undeserved status as blockbuster ; the stupendously annoying theme song by hammer ; endless iterations of the word "" ooky "" in print . 1991's the addams family was not a terrible film . it was high-spirited and gleefully performed . it simply exhausted its premise after about fifteen minutes . addams family values is lots more of the same , which means that its premise is exhausted before it begins . yet it's both worse and better than its predecessor , the latter the result of christina ricci's marvelously morbid wednesday . like many recent megasequels , addams family values meticulously recreates the original , element for element . the script is once again largely a collection of black-humored sight gags and one-liners , and the theme song is again rap ( a slightly altered version of tag team's excruciating hit "" whoomp ! even the title design is the same ; "" no surprises "" is clearly the motto in place . the only real question is , is it funny , and as in the case of the addams family the answer is "" sometimes . "" there aren't as many laughs as there were in the original , but the laughs that do come are bigger . there's a great photo among the shots of debbie's previous disguises , and the summer camp play is an anarchic riot . what almost never worked for me were the jokes in the "" setup . . . macabre retort "" format . i kept wanting to yell out , "" all right , they're weird , i get the point . "" values is broken into three almost entirely unrelated subplots ( not that plot is an issue here ) . the debbie/uncle fester plot is extremely sluggish ; joan cusack tries gamely , but doesn't quite click as the villainous black widow . the biggest surprise may be that gomez and morticia play a very small role in the proceedings . they get a nice , goofy dance sequence , but for most of the film raul julia only reacts , while anjelica huston spends her time hitting lighting marks so that her eyes and cheekbones appear translucent . the summer camp subplot is far and away the best , and ricci is a demonic delight . ricci spits out her lines with comic venom , and provides most of values' highlights . the easiest conclusion to reach about addams family values is that it will probably please those it was made to please , the same folks who brought over $100 million to the addams family . if you didn't like the original formula , there's little to inspire a change of heart the second time around . she deserves better .

1340,"director : scott hicks . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( sexual situations , adult themes , violence , profanity ) running time : 127 minutes . several months ago , upon hearing that david guterson's much-respected novel _snow falling on cedars_ was being turned into a film , i made my usual effort to familiarize myself with the source material . after approximately 90 pages , i did something i almost never do : i surrendered . the grinding pacing of the story -- which , at the point i lost interest , had consisted almost entirely of a court proceeding -- did absolutely nothing to motivate persistence . whatever intriguing themes might have been contained in guterson's tale would never be known to me thanks to a narrative decision i considered crippling : waiting far too long to get to the point . this background is offered to make it clear that my ambivalence towards scott hicks' snow falling on cedars has nothing to do with affection for the source material . it also sets up the problem with the film , which is the same problem i had with the novel . it's not the first time the screen has seen a story of lovers separated by the japanese-american internment camps ( alan parker fumbled the similarly-themed come see the paradise ) , but that doesn't mean it's not an important story to tell . in fact , snow falling on cedars has an angle on the often-didactic issue of racism that makes it potentially compelling . those feelings , however , are not some easily dismissable bigotry . unfortunately , by the time it's clear how hicks and co-screenwriter ron bass are trying to personalize the murky matter of racism , the film is almost over . that leaves a film with two glaring flaws . the first is ethan hawke's performance as ishmael , which is so blank that the role might just as easily have been played by a cardboard cutout . hicks does a nice job with ishmael and hatsue's secretive adolescent trysts inside a hollow tree , but he doesn't do much to help us understand ishmael's longing . hawke plays most of his scenes with a thousand-yard stare we're expected to interpret as a combination of introspection and repressed emotion , while it could just as easily be interpreted as trying to remember where he left his car keys . by the time hicks tries to crank up the drama by cranking up james newton howard's score during a wildly overwrought sequence involving hatsue's "" dear john "" letter , it's too late to give the relationship the sense of consequence it demands . the second problem is the directorial self-indulgence exemplified by that "" dear john "" sequence , which shows up at every possible wrong time . there's too much film-making business going on for too long , and too little of the human story that should intensify the historical story . i didn't surrender on the film version of snow falling on cedars . i merely walked out unsatisfied , wondering why the story , like bad journalism , had to bury the lead . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"" film is a medium of showing , not telling . a script full of probing psychoanalytical dialogue is a script unable --or unwilling -- to show viewers what the characters are all about . that's a restraint james mangold's adaptation could have used a lot more of . well , lisa's just a good old-fashioned sociopath . through her experience , susanna begins to question who she is , and how easy it can be to be defined by others -- or even by yourself -- as crazy . mangold takes the subject just a bit farther , flashing back to susanna's life as a morose , directionless teenager in an upper class family . the problem is that the nurse has to tell her -- and , by extension , us . that's also only one of half a dozen or so scenes in which characters begin dissecting the others by revealing their deep , dark secrets . whatever points kaysen and mangold might have been trying to make about the fine line between sanity and insanity -- or about how those lines may be defined differently for women -- are lost in tearful breakdowns and manufactured drama . it would be remiss of me not to mention angelina jolie's performance as lisa , the wild child who serves as the ward's alpha female . it would be remiss not because jolie's performance is exceptional -- showy , flashy and fun , perhaps , though not exceptional -- but because it's a movie performance of a real-life character . everything in girl , interrupted seems designed to be satisfying as entertainment , not to be true to susanna kaysen's life or her unique perspective on that life . it's a movie that feels always and forever like a movie . that means punch lines and crescendos ; it means winona ryder shouting a story better told in quieter tones ; it means one of the worst false beards in film history on jared leto as susanna's boyfriend . and it means everyone telling everyone else how crazy they are or aren't , every character's story an open book . . . or , in this case , an open script . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"" the height of irony is that you can see that kind of deadly earnest acting going on in scream 3 . she does her damndest to make sure we all understand how haunted she is , as though anyone could possibly care about the deep psychological underpinnings of sidney prescott . it's one thing for a character to make a reference to the developments in the godfather trilogy ; it's another for campbell to pretend she's playing michael corleone . scream 3 is a purely functional shocker , but it takes all the wrong things seriously and plays all the wrong things for laughs . craven and company have forgotten the rules , all right . they've even forgotten why the series was worth a third installment in the first place . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"" it's an intriguing start , except for one small problem : there's a lot more we need to know about richard . in fact , there's a lot more we need to know about virtually everyone and everything in the beach . director danny boyle's travelogue-cum-human nature treatise proves to be a tremendously frustrating experience -- it's a lazy film that thinks it's being profound . soon richard begins suspecting that the threats to the community from without -- edgy marijuana farmers , more americans -- may be less troubling than the threats from within . during its first hour , the beach does an effective job of setting tone , largely through the efforts of superb technical craftsmen . the island locations are spectacular , and donald mcalpine's production design of the islanders' camp is a tidy marvel . the beach wants to set up an initial dichotomy -- the pasteurized pleasures of most tourist destinations compared to the raw glory of the island -- that eventually proves to be false . on a visual level , it's hard not to argue that boyle and company succeed . unfortunately for boyle and company -- and for you , john or jane q . potential audience member -- the characters eventually have to play a role in the film . when they do , it becomes quite clear that nobody understands why anybody is doing anything . richard's vague motivations and frustrations over sanitized tourist experiences seem provocative as the film begins , but soon the script begins dropping in details about his past -- e . g . he's a video game junkie -- without bothering to explain why that matters except as an excuse for boyle to include an admittedly creative fantasy sequence . that complete apathy over exploring motivation spills over into every other character , as screenwriter john hodge never bothers with the tiny matter of what the islanders want their paradise to represent , or why sal above all others treats the place as a holy secret . the characters -- including dicaprio , whose performance is about as good as you can expect in a role so under-written -- generally appear to be occupying space and serving plot functions , to the ridiculous extreme that the head marijuana farmer gives a knowing nod after his solution to the film's climactic problem proves him a worthy successor to solomon in the despotic wisdom department . of course , letting the complexities of the characters come to the surface would have required some actual effort , as opposed to offering up the premise as it stands . it's ridiculously obvious thematic material , yet the makers of the beach seem convinced that presenting that theme is enough to earn them philosophical style points . ultimately , style points are all they earn , though they earn those style points in impressive quantities . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1344,"screenplay : john milius and larry gross . director : walter hill . to paraphrase the old song , and to make a distressing confession , i don't know much about history . when approaching a film based on historical subject matter , i rarely find myself basing my critique on accuracy , for better or worse . nevertheless , i had a feeling i was going to have a problem with geronimo : an american legend as sool as i noted that wes studi , who portrays the title character , had been given fourth billing . as authentic as it looks , geronimo just doesn't click because it doesn't make its principal character the focus of the story . like dances with wolves , it's not so much a story about native americans as it is about guilty white men . perhaps the most glaring problem with the script for geronimo is that it doesn't seem to have a direction or a clear enough sense of its point of view . although the narration is coming from davis , geronimo is not a first-person narrative . much takes place without him present , so it's difficult to see events as they develop as somehow having an impact on davis . when davis gives an impassioned statement near the end of the film about his shame at the government's treatment of the apache , i found myself wondering why he was the one to get that scene . as questionable as the decision to let the story come from a white man might be , geronimo at least should have had the conviction to show us more through his eyes once that decision was made , so that davis' loss of innocence makes sense . screenwriters john milius and larry gross also do a less than impressive job of making geronimo himself come alive . wes studi is grim-faced and taciturn , but his anger is never real enough . geronimo is treated more as a symbol than a man , and i came away from the film with very little insight into his character . all this is not to say that geronimo doesn't do many things right . cinematographer lloyd ahern does some of the year's finest work , capturing the southwestern deserts in rich reds and oranges . gene hackman and robert duvall both turn in typically marvelous performances , finding much more nuance than the script provides , and their one scene together is truly great work . ry cooder's score is also noteworthy . in fact , everything about geronimo screams "" epic , "" but somewhere along the line a fair amount of substance leaked out of the stylish wrapper . geronimo : an american legend clocks in at about 1 : 55 , short by the standards of the holidays' other big releases , yet it seemed much longer . a barroom showdown with a group of bounty hunters didn't seem to serve any real purpose , and the editing generally seemed disjointed . geronimo wants to be revisionist , but it doesn't provide enough real information , or compelling enough characters to make me care . somewhere amidst the cliches is the story of a warrior who fought and killed for what was being taken from him , but it didn't make it to the screen in this version . in a case of an extremely misleading title , geronimo : an american legend doesn't do enough to make a real historical figure real .

1345,"screenplay : mark steven johnson . director : donald petrie . in a sense , there's really not all that much to say about a movie like grumpy old men . it's the kind of movie one generally describes with somewhat faint-praise adjectives like "" cute , "" or "" fun , "" or "" entertaining . "" grumpy old men is all of these things , to a point . there are a couple of belly laughs , but there's not much genuine spark . for all its manufactured whimsy , grumpy old men is basically a sit-com , a moderately diverting 105-minute episode of "" the golden boys . "" the beautiful and spirited airel attracts the attention of both men , but neither is brave enough to make the first move . so when ariel makes the first move--for both of them--old animosities are stirred to the boiling point . for one thing , it's simply a pleasure to see lemmon and matthau together again . the trouble is that they're not given all that much to do besides call each other "" moron "" and "" putz . "" there are a few nice bits of physical humor , notable lemmon spraying matthau with a garden hose and matthau taking an ax to a foot of ice in a futile attempt to retrieve his prized ice-fishing pole . but for the most part grumpy old men just strolls along , apparently convinced that we're so comfortable with the actors that we'll find anything they do amusing . the other characterizations in grumpy old men are wildly uneven . on the plus side is ann-margret , who is positively luminous . she's perfect for the role of ariel , radiating a joie de vivre which would clearly be appealing to the two icy septugenarians . there is a marvelous warmth to her scenes with lemmon and matthau , and i was sorry that her part wasn't even larger . he appears briefly for the express purpose of being cantankerous and sexually suggestive , once again proving that it's supposed to be funny that older people think about sex , too . their characters don't serve much purpose , and while both actors are very appealing , i couldn't figure out what the point was . grumpy old men does nothing to offend overtly . the photography of the snow-covered minnesota town is bright and atmospheric , particularly the ice-fishing village ; alan silvestri adds a cheerful if somewhat pedestrian score . there are enough chuckles in the film to make it a decent matinee diversion , but overall grumpy old men relies far too much on the history between lemmon and matthau , and far too little on anything particularly clever in mark steven johnson's script .

1347,"a few months ago , i was at a press screening for another touchstone film which was preceded by a teaser trailer for mission to mars . as the trailer unfolded , the critics in the audience began to snicker with increasing frequency . the imagery used was startling similar to images from 2001 : a space odyssey -- an astronaut in a white room , an approach to a dark object in the distance , a figure spinning off into space . it was comical not just because of the familiarity , but because it seemed so quintessentially brian de palma . the train station sequence in the untouchables came from eisenstein's potemkin ; the single-take opening sequence in snake eyes felt like welles' touch of evil ; whole heaping chunks of his early films appropriated hitchcockian devices and themes . so why wouldn't de palma take on the most iconic science-fiction film ever made while making his first science-fiction film ? why not add kubrick to his list of victims of auteur homage ? it's more alarming that it's similar to the cookie-cutter hollywood approach to any story . the frustrating thing about any brian de palma film is that you can always count on at least one extended sequence where you realize what a brilliant technical craftsman he can be . a chain reaction of events following that accident keeps building tension , leading to some genuinely tense moments . de palma's sense for timing this sort of sequence is impeccable -- recall the editing of tom cruise's computer room break-in in mission : impossible -- leading to the hope that mission to mars can maintain that sort of visual and emotional energy . and then you remember this is brian de palma . every once in a while , by sheer twisted accident , de palma ends up working with a rich , smart script -- the untouchables , blow out , carlito's way . more often , you get the impression that he looks for a script with a few places he can show off his visual flair . mission to mars has its showcase sequence , but it also has a leaden script full of plug-and-play characterizations . it's the sort of mawkish back-story screenwriters use all the time in adventure films , in a token -- and usually futile -- attempt to show that the people matter more than the concept . ironically , mission to mars is that rare case where the concept does matter more than the people . when mission to mars gets metaphysical , it makes sure there's someone on hand to narrate every brutally obvious revelation , and someone whose individual journey to wholeness will be completed by this close encounter . this film doesn't end with the awe of creation ; it ends with tedious exposition topped off by an interplanetary clasping of hands . there are flashes of brian de palma the visceral thrill-master in mission to mars , but he doesn't seem to know what to do with its limp conclusion . this time around , it probably would have been a good idea . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1350,"director : steve miner . for a while there , i had declared a personal moratorium on disney's live-action formula pictures . although i found cool runnings moderately entertaining , i realized that was about as much as i could expect : a smile here , a chuckle there , something i'd take my kids to see if i had any and wanted to get them out of the house on a saturday afternoon . with the presence of gerard depardieu , i had slightly higher hopes for my father the hero , but i was kidding myself . while he lends a roguish charm to the proceedings , he's still trapped in a movie which seems designed more to divert than to entertain . it would be one thing if my father the hero were simply predictable , which it is , but it is also just badly written . my father the hero is based on a french film i have not seen titled mon pere , ce heros , but it is hard to believe that the characters could have been as fuzzy as they are here . the lies are just a device , and even if we believe it's just adolescence at work there's no particular reason to care . one doesn't necessarily expect well-rounded characters from a film like my father the hero , but one should at leas find reasonably coherent types . still , as silly and incoherent as the script may be , gerard depardieu still gets to read many of the lines , and he has superb comic timing . but it's part of the problem that he has such a rapport with everyone ; if part of the point is that andre needs to become a better father and a more selfless person , we never see any indication that he is anything but a perfectly nice guy , if slightly overprotective . there would have been so many more comic possibilities in a rakish playboy being saddled with everyone's belief that he is a cradle-robber . heigl is lovely as nicole , perhaps too lovely ; i'm not sure why she'd need to lie to hook anyone . my father , the hero is wholesome , good-natured and does virtually nothing to offend . but it needs more than that , namely something to make it worth ninety minutes of anyone's time . gerard depardieu is fun to watch , and proves surprisingly adept at physical comedy . it would have been nice to see him work with a script that seemed to have any imagination or sense of structure behind it .

1351,"how's this for damnation via faint praise : i'm pretty impressed that 28 days didn't turn out to be an utterly unwatchable disaster . there aren't many film premises that would set off my early crap alert system like a feel-good comedy-drama about folks in a rehab clinic ( maybe robin williams in a feel-good comedy-drama about a robot who wants to be human ) . you've got your pathos , you've got your cheap emotion , you've got your showy drunken scenes for actors and you've got your central character arc so rigidly defined you could set your watch by when denial turns into a great big group hug . i've got to hand it to director betty thomas for lending 28 days a little dark edge , and to screenwriter susannah grant for delivering a few more solid laughs than i was expecting . unfortunately , they're still not able to overcome the basic flaws in their story . emphasis on the "" long "" and "" slow . "" there are more than a few good gags to be found in the interaction between the support group members , but there's nothing driving the narrative forward once gwen decides to go straight . it's not that the process of recovery ends with one decision , of course . in 28 days , however , the process of drama does end with that one descision , leaving the film to grab at relationships and confrontations that never go anywhere . those moments might have seemed more vital if not for the uninspired performance by sandra bullock . it feels like i've been a bullock booster long after most others have leapt from her feisty-cute bandwagon , but there's little going on behind her attitude in 28 days . at least her post-sobriety scenes are a reprieve from her cartoon rendition of staggering drunkenness . in this role , bullock looks like she's completely out of her depth . betty thomas does do a nice job with altered perspectives , shooting hazy memories in grainy video and capturing some funny confessional scenes with an i'm-the-center-of-the-world iris effect . there is the small problem that those confessionals don't really belong in 28 days , but there's no solid sense of what belongs throughout the story . the fragmentation of family , the different paths taken by two adult children of an alcoholic and the challenges of forgiveness could have made for a much more compelling sub-text than a half-hearted romantic triangle with eddie at the other vertex . 28 days offers some effective comedy , and it does manage to avoid pathos and cheap emotion . in fact , with its fragmented narrative and limp lead performance , it comes close to avoiding emotion altogether . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1352,"director : stanley tucci . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , brief nudity ) running time : 104 minutes . 1996's big night , co-directed with campbell scott , was a beautiful low-key gem , easily one of that year's best films . 1998's the impostors , tucci's debut as a solo director , was an amusing but slight piece of episodic farce . yes indeed , tucci's development as a film-maker continues -- slowly but steadily -- in reverse . mitchell turns gould into the subject of one of his profile pieces , turning gould into an even bigger bohemian celebrity in the process . there's no question that the eccentric gould makes for just as interesting a character today as he would have made 40 years ago . it just never appears that tucci knows exactly what to do with that character . he fiddles about with analogies between josephs gould and mitchell as deliberate writers and human chroniclers , suggesting the very fine line between those who can manage their neuroses and those who can't . and that's about all he does with any of his themes -- he fiddles and toys and nods , leaving joe gould's secret to drift along with little more than its value as historical curiosity to hold it all together . mostly , tucci indulges ian holm as gould . it's the kind of role that screams for oscar attention , infinitely more flamboyant than holm's devastating turn in the sweet hereafter yet infinitely less deserving of praise . sometimes holm nails the sad soul of the exhibitionist gould , and even when the performance isn't perfect it's still plenty interesting to watch . the interplay between holm and tucci makes for most of the best moments in joe gould's secret , but there's always the nagging sense that this should have been more than a showy character study . every once in a while , tucci makes the kind of interesting film-making choices that show what he's capable of . there are a few crafty sequences in which characters duck in and out of the frame , the individual speakers subjugated to the conversation and the space between them . there are also dozens of tiny distractions that make hard to view joe gould's secret as more than a potentially provocative missed opportunity . it's ironic that the story chides notions of celebrity , then casts susan sarandon and steve martin in cameo appearances . it's even more ironic that , in a story of artistic indecision , tucci can't quite settle on a solid center for his film . joe gould's secret is the sort of film you find fitfully interesting while never really finding it gripping . it found me lamenting the direction tucci's behind-the-camera career has taken , increasingly wondering whether campbell scott might have been the real talent behind big night . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1353,"screenplay : stuart gordon , dennis paoli & nicholas st . john . director : abel ferrara . abel ferrara's body snatchers marks the third screen adaptation of jack finney's novel the body snatchers , and you'd think that there wouldn't be all that much new to say about pod people by now . the scene for this latest adaptation is an army base , and the metaphor has changed as well . somewhere in body snatchers is a poke at the military mindset , but it's buried beneath layers of atmosphere , atmosphere which works but doesn't make that extra leap to real terror . director ferrara ( bad lieutenant ) has crafted a stylish and spooky look for the film , filtered in dark ambers and deep blues , full of shadows and twisted angles . the issue of identity is always present , as actors frequently appear only as silhouettes against the light , or veiled by other shadows . some early scenes highlighting the pod people's uniformity , particularly a frighteningly comic scene where young andy realizes the other kids in day care lack a certain artistic creativity , are extremely well-handled . ferrara also manages the tricky task of directing his actors so that the transformed characters appear clearly to have changed without playing the stock blank-faced automoton . technically , body snatchers hits just about all of its marks , particularly with its rather graphic image of what happens to the remains of a human body after the transformation has taken place . yet while body snatchers held my attention , it didn't do anything particularly interesting which seemed to warrand a re-telling of this already twice-told tale . the screenwriters throw in one speech by the base commander ( full metal jacket's r . lee ermey ) which seems designed to emphasize this point , but ferrara doesn't do much with it . no single theme really drives this body snatchers , nor are any of the characters interesting enough to pull it along with them . structurally , body snatchers suffers from a climax which seems far too drawn out . once the malones start running , the tension should continue to build , but too many of the scenes involving confrontations between "" real "" humans and the 'snatchers lack punch . there is one wickedly chilling moment of revelation , but it is isolated . body snatchers does a fantastic job of establishing its tone , and it does offer a few decent scares . the problem with ferrara's pacing is that it's like the body snatchers themselves : too cool when the adrenaline should be flowing .

1354,"the term has at times been used to define any film which women tend to like more than men ( sleepless in seattle comes to mind ) , but in its strictest sense i define a "" chick film "" as one which deals with relationships men could only attempt to comprehend : mother-daughter , female friendships , and birth mother-child . angie definitely falls within this framework . it's got mothers , daughters , friends , childbirth and a dose of heartbreak to guarantee maximum lacrimal viscosity , and all these things may affect the target audience . i found myself impressed by geena davis' performance , but bothered by the obvious and excessive manipulation which never really pays off , and by some unfortunate mixed messages . davis plays the title character , bensonhurst , brooklyn resident angie scacciapensieri . geena davis' performance as angie is easily the best thing about angie , which is fine because it's also the most important thing . most of davis' roles to date have emphasized her comic talents , but angie confirms what thelma & louise suggested : that davis is a very gifted all around actor . stephen rea is also extremely slick and charming as noel , and the scenes between davis and rea provide many of angie's highlights . through its first hour , angie is an interesting and appealing character drama with real promise . the second half of todd graff's script suffers from two major problems . the first is that it seriously overloads on emotional high points . there were at least four separate points at which i thought that angie had reached its climax , and what made that decision the most frustrating is that none of them quite provided the catharsis that angie needed but always just missed . i got the feeling that hollywood pictures had tested several endings , found that the audiences responded to each one , and then decided to keep them all . consequently , angie loses its narrative momentum two thirds of the way through and coasts to the finish on its tear-jerking . the second , and perhaps more distracting , problem is a rather personal distaste for what i perceived as a sell-out in the change in angie's perspective which occurs at the end of the film . a speech angie makes to her baby surprised me by suggesting that angie believed her problem was thinking too much about herself , when i felt she was thinking about herself for the first time in her life . the fits and starts in the film's many climaxes left me wondering what it was that i was supposed to have learned from angie's story . it is a given that a film like angie pulls emotional strings , and that in itself is not a failing . manipulating our emotions is what films are supposed to do ; the best ones just manage to do it so skillfully that we don't notice or don't care . angie doesn't achieve that deft middle ground . it crosses its signals , piles on the pathos , and leaves its star to carry most of its emotional baggage .

1355,"for approximately five minutes , the computer-animated dinosaur is undeniably spectacular . the story creeps up without dialogue , following the fate of one little dinosaur egg from its trampled , abandoned nest across an astonishing primeval landscape . seven years removed from the revolutionary screen creations of jurassic park , i didn't think it would be possible for the mere sight of digital dinosaurs to seize the imagination , but it happens in dinosaur nonetheless . with its entirely visual storytelling , dinosaur's prologue offers a giddiness-inducing prospect : an introduction to a lost world as quietly , primally engrossing as kubrick's "" dawn of man "" prologue to 2001 : a space odyssey . and then a cute little simian opens its stupid mouth . i knew going into dinosaur that it was a disney film aimed at kids , so i can't say i was expecting anything more profound than the story it ultimately provided . that didn't make its presence any less disappointing . yaaaaaaawwn . disney's animated features have generally been pretty formulaic , so it's no shock to discover that dinosaur features a by-the-numbers script . this variation , however , is so relentlessly somber and dreary that there's nothing left but formula . the personalities of the principal characters are so bland and the vocal performances so uninspired that the characters threaten to disappear into the backgrounds -- no small feat considering the overwhelming brown-ness of the desolate post-apocalyptic scenery . even the minor characters like zini and eema -- those theoretically present to provide a little comic relief -- can't inject any life into the film . in recent disney films , the musical numbers have come off as purely obligatory , but i found myself pleading for a snappy tune to breathe some life into the film . it's hard to imagine what young viewers would find to embrace in this grim production , and even harder to imagine what would keep an adult awake . there's no denying that the technology involved in the creation of dinosaur is extraordinary , mixing the computerized cast with some real-world settings so seamlessly that it's virtually impossible to tell where reality and hard drive overlap . apparently , however , co-director ralph zondag has become no more adept at dinosaur-driven storytelling than he was for the limp 1993 animated feature we're back ! that film seemed rushed into theaters to capitalize on that summer's jurassic juggernaut . this one misses its opportunity to step out of the spielbergian shadow , gradually devolving into a series of all-too-familiar set pieces . that's a sad end to a film that begins with so much promise . better to recycle disney's orphan fetish without a whiff of personality or humor , its early grandeur slowly but steadily fading into extinction . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1356,"starring : nicolas cage , shirley maclaine . screenplay : hugh wilson and peter torokvei . director : hugh wilson . i mean no condescension when i say that guarding tess is the kind of movie that my grandparents would love . they see about a movie per year , if that , and when they do choose to plunk down their $7 . 00 a piece they tend to opt for something light and frothy , usually one of those comedies featuring two decent but strong-willed characters who spar but obviously care about each other . these films are always good for a few smiles , and are generally inoffensive . intellectually , i understand the appeal of such once- in-a-blue-moon-night-on-the-town entertainments , and some of them do give the character interaction zing . it's just two pleasant , well-acted characters with nothing to do . guarding tess owes every ounce of charm it displays to the very engaging lead performances of nicolas cage and shirley maclaine . cage often seems to have only two gears on screen--frantic and manic--but here he des a surprisingly restrained turn as the frustrated agent . he is appropriately humorless about a job doug takes very seriously , yet he doesn't go for wooden . maclaine , who seems to get every role in hollywood written for a woman over 50 , has mastered the flinty dame bit by now , while always managing to leave a bit of softness around the edges . tess is not a particular stretch for maclaine , but she never mails in a performance . the interaction between doug and tess in the film's first half hour is amusing in a low-key way , never degenerating into over-the-top theatrics . at almost every stage the relationship seems completely natural , and that relationship makes for some entertaining scenes . what torpedoes guarding tess is the sense that director and co-writer hugh wilson didn't really know what to do with these two characters . since wilson's greatest success has come on the small screen , it should come as no surprise that guarding tess feels a lot like a pilot for a series . the characters are established , but the plot is nearly non-existent . very quickly , guarding tess begins to repeat itself , with too many redundant scenes of doug and tess butting heads , tess winning and doug fuming . it's a film that just floats around like a hovercraft on a layer of niceness . then , when wilson finally seems to realize the need for a second plot point , he creates an utterly ridiculous subplot involving a kidnapping . i have this feeling the conclusion we see was not his first choice . there is a silly red herring involving tess's son which i suspect was not a red herring in some earlier incarnation , because the revelation of who the kidnappers are inspires a big "" what ? "" i also believe wilson might have considered a slightly darker resolution , but was concerned about ruining all the good will he had worked so hard to generate . the result is just grossly out of touch with the rest of the movie anyway . fluffy and inconsequential doesn't have to mean tedious . guarding tess might make a fine bargain matinee for someone seeking a chuckle or two . at least that's what i'd tell my grandparents .

1357,"director : mike figgis . late in mike figgis' experimental drama timecode , a young would-be film-maker pitches an idea to a hollywood production company for a film shot on digital video , following four characters in real time in one uninterrupted take . . . at which suggestion one of the production executives bursts into laughter and calls the idea "" pretentious . "" it seems like figgis is trying to have a little fun at his own expense , since that pitched idea is exactly the idea behind timecode : four characters followed in real time , the screen divided into four quadrants to follow their individual stories . and it would be easier to buy figgis' self-deprecation as genuine if he didn't then begin his closing credits with a caption describing exactly how the film had been made . "" look what an interesting and original film you've just watched , "" figgis says to us out of one corner of his mouth , while the other mutters , "" and it was all just a big pretentious joke . "" figgis has been on a kick in the last couple of years of trying to stretch cinematic boundaries , but it's too often too difficult to get past his art-for-art's-sake bluster . timecode was essentially improvised around a loose plot structure , leading to a predictably ragged feel to the film . and while figgis would probably emphasize that raggedness as a function of the film's realism and immediacy , it simply doesn't make for particularly engrossing viewing a lot of the time . at times timecode is a satire of film industry poseurs , and occasionally a very funny one . most intrusive of all is the use of a series of earthquakes as a device to shake up the lives of the characters . in a more conventional film , it might have been easier to forgive the obvious and repetitive symbolism . in a film like timecode , you begin wondering when figgis will ever take off his avant-garde hat and just let a story be a story . i might have considered timecode a thoroughly failed experiment if not for a development that briefly justifies the entire structure . in timecode , i was able to watch tripplehorn throughout the scene , from her puzzled but intent face as the background noise from the screening room prevents her from hearing rose , to the anguish that overwhelms her once it's impossible to deny the truth . film too rarely allows us to watch actors do purely physical acting . i was so fascinated by tripplehorn's wordless performance that i rarely took my eyes off of her quadrant of the screen , even when there was dialogue coming from elsewhere . i'd gladly accept a structure like that in timecode if it meant i could spend time following interesting supporting characters instead of blank-faced bores like burrows' depressed hollywood wife . of course , i'd prefer it if a film-maker acknowledged the importance of developing character and story , rather than assuming falsely that improvisation is always the best way to get at the "" truth "" of a situation . the snicker itself was a completely believable reaction ; the woman's puzzled expression , as though she had never before in her life heard a joke about her name , strains all credulity . figgis , however , never intrudes on his experiment in realism , not even so it might make more real-world sense . all that remains is his self-congratulation at doing something entirely new , even if it ultimately feels mostly like a big pretentious joke . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"" assuming the question isn't rhetorical , i'd like to pose one : exactly why is this film called shaft , anyway ? the original 1971 "" blaxploitation "" film may look rough and ridiculously dated to contemporary eyes -- it's hard to take seriously any film in which the word "" whitey "" plays such a prominent role -- but it was a fairly revolutionary portrayal of an african-american anti-hero as tough , sexual and beholden to absolutely no one . the presence of isaac hayes' famous theme song may tell you this is shaft , but is this story the one described in those famous lyrics ? the 1971 original was an audacious film in its low-budget way , including a scene in which shaft ( roundtree ) has sex with a white woman . it's depressing to realize that mainstream hollywood continues to be as timid as it ever was in portraying the sexuality of black men . aside from a stylized montage over the opening credits , jackson's shaft is practically asexual . there's plenty of danger all about in shaft , with two extremely effective villains . some viewers may find his performance the most outrageous latino crime boss parody since pacino tore up his cuban accent in scarface . i found something compelling and creepy about peoples , from his manic self-mutilation to his casual con artistry . between the two of them , bale and wright could have been the anchors of a better-than-average cop thriller , one that didn't have a title immediately creating a different set of expectations . no question , samuel l . jackson can be a bad mutha . in fact , there's so much emphasis on making him tough in a mad-as-hell way that jackson never captures shaft's toughness in an i-don't-have-anything-to- prove-to-anyone way . throughout the film , it becomes ever more clear that singleton has either misunderstood what made john shaft such an important screen character or found himself unable to convey that same essence . he also found himself unable to build a story that means anything , resorting to a climax that may be intended as a triumph over the system but ultimately renders the previous 90 minutes of action utterly pointless . i can't deny that i might have felt much more positively about shaft if it hadn't set itself up for comparison to an iconic film . there are some solidly entertaining moments here , perhaps enough to satisfy viewers with little or no awareness of the history behind the title . but there's that title before the film , a title that just feels wrong for what follows it on the screen . they're just not talkin' about shaft . and i can't dig it . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1361,"director : wolfgang petersen . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 136 minutes . the amazing thing about sebastian junger's best-selling non-fiction book the perfect storm was that it created an enthralling , page-turning story out of two less-than-pulse-pounding subjects : fishing and weather . even more surprising , perhaps , was the manner in which he chose to make those subjects readable . rather than creating a de facto novel about the people involved in the events , junger dives into journalistic detail . he immerses the reader so completely in the hard lives of swordfishermen as a culture that it's never necessary for him to over-dramatize the individual lives he's focusing on . as for the weather , he is similarly successful at creating specifics out of generalities . for junger , tension and adventure came from the simple facts . instead , he chose melodramatic twaddle . it's not an easy job wittliff has taken on , because there's no obvious through-line for junger's account to take as a screen story . the book effectively conveyed the personal and physical toll exacted by a fisherman's life , and for a while it appears that wittliff is pointing the story in the right direction . the perfect storm could have been set up as a seafaring twister , with stick figure characters wrapped in cool meteorological special effects . this film , at least , has its heart in the right place . its dialogue , however , could not be more wrong , wrong , wrong . perhaps panicked over how to make a journalistic account "" engaging "" for viewers , the makers of the perfect storm apparently gave bill wittliff the following instructions for writing his characters : "" imagine a particularly bad romance novel with a $100 million budget . "" they say things like , "" there's only love ; "" they say things like , "" you're heading right into the mouth of the monster ! ; "" for all the verisimilitude wittliff pumps into the conversations , the fishermen might as well have spent two hours growling "" arrgh , matey "" to one another . if not for the thrillingly staged final hour , the perfect storm might have been a total loss . as it stands , it's just on the border of worth a look . director wolfgang petersen stages the andrea gail's perilous journey with the kind of tension that finds you pulling yourself into a ball in your seat ; there's also a strangely effective scene involving a mid-air refueling attempt for a rescue helicopter thwarted by the intense winds . it's purely visceral film-making , mind you , but it's very good visceral film-making , and at least you don't have to worry about listening to the next ridiculous thing to come out of someone's mouth . it's ironic , because the perfect storm had the potential to be a powerfully human story in spite of showy visual effects and adventure set pieces . instead , it's only worth watching for its visual effects and adventure set pieces . the storm itself is perfect ; the purple prose journey towards that storm makes you long for a bit more journalistic distance . or at least for someone to fiddle with the sound mix so the wind drowned out every word . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1362,"screenplay : barry schneider & richard hawley . director : yves simoneau . hey , mr . development executive , have i got a pitch for you . now here's the casting twist : jamie lee curtis , scream queen ingenue of late 70s/early 80s horror films as the * villain * . give it a french director and some moody photography to make it look more respectable , and voila ! you've got a bona fide hit on your hands , right ? well , probably not . mother's boys occupies that unfortunate middle ground between teen scarefest and pop phenom psychothriller , inevitably limiting its audience . it also swings wildly from the subtly creepy to the just-plain-dumb . robert will have none of it , but jude is more than determined--she's sociopathic . mother's boys is one of those movies where it's easy to spend a lot of time picking apart flaws in logic , if logic is something you expect from your thrillers . i suppose it would have been too stereotypical for callie to be * just * a teacher . then there are silly details like the band-aid which is supposed to cover the cut on jude's forehead , and "" cliche alert "" problems like the use of not one , not two , but * three * nightmare sequences . the script is sloppy in its attempt to explain jude's pathology , and the character development is virtually non-existent . yet for all that , mother's boys still almost won me over on style points alone . from the eye-catching opening credits to the climax , director yves simoneau gives the production a smoky , dreamlike atmosphere which maintains tension throughout . the story is thankfully short on gothic excess , and i was pleasantly surprised by the twist to jude's plan . jamie lee curtis is generally well- directed , veering into the overblown only rarely . finally , it leaves kes at a point of uncertainty , a rarity in films of any kind . while it may not have done much for my brain , mother's boys did get my skin crawling . what disappointed me about mother's boys was that i thought it made the wrong choices about jude . once the choice was made to go in the latter direction , mother's boys committed itself to being a thriller , and ultimately it's not that scary . how much more interesting it would have been to watch jude turn all three boys against callie , be more subtle in her seduction of robert , or make callie want to leave .

1363,"screenplay : david schow and john shirley . i have seen a number of reviewers falling over themselves to praise the crow , and i'm not convinced that many of them haven't been unduly influenced by the film's morbid history . i , like many , hoped that the crow would serve as a fitting epitaph to a budding star , and show that he hadn't died simply to make another schlocky action-fantasy . but sadly , that's basically what the crow is--a paper thin story supporting a lot of rain and moody lighting . all right , let's dispense with the formalities right off the top : the crow * looks * great . but there is very little the crow does visually that blade runner or batman didn't already do , and for the most part do better . proyas wheels out cliches like the cityscape on fire opening shot , the close-up of the hero's face dripping with rain , and lightning revealing something previously hidden in shadow . while the art direction and cinematography are striking , there is nothing original enough to obscure the glaring weaknesses in the rest of the film . the trouble begins with the script by david schow and john shirley , but the fact is that there's no way of knowing what changes were made as a result of lee's death . perhaps the original script didn't begin with eric and shelly already dead , giving more poignance to the story and a chance to understand what eric has lost beyond the snippets shown in flashback . what is true of eric's characterization is true of the characterizations right down the line : they're either lazy , or they just don't make sense . michael wincott does fine work as the villain , but the attempt to explain his motivation is one of the lamest in recent memory . however , i'm willing to admit that there may be only two relevant questions for most potential viewers of the crow : 1 ) is it a good action film ? the answer to #1 is , better than most ; the crow is well paced , well choreographed and is at least somewhat creative . as for #2 , it's hard to say . unlike most action stars , lee at least had english as his native language , and given time he might have become a good actor . but in the crow , he wasn't yet . and i can't help but think that if he were alive today , most critics wouldn't have bee so forgiving .

1364,"screenplay : greg harrison . director : greg harrison . that uniquely fin-de-siecle phenomenon known as the "" rave "" gets its sociological moment in the sun in groove , a film that will be more effective as cultural curiosity a few years hence than it is as a story today . as the djs spin on , so do their stories and several others spin along for 86 minutes . that time is moderately well-spent as an introduction to the rave sub-culture . harrison drops in a few bits of memorable lingo ( "" buying a vowel "" for purchasing either acid or ecstasy ; "" the nod "" for the party-goer's acknowledgement of the party-thrower's success ; "" baked , not fried "" for one fellow's expressed preference for marijuana over hallucinogens ) to set the scene without stranding newcomers in the minutia . from the dance floor to the fruit-and-water-stocked "" chill room , "" groove re-creates its unique world as effectively as you could hope for . harrison then proceeds to populate that world with one unmemorable , uninvolving character after another . most of the narrative is spent on david and leyla , whose budding relationship is supposed to be the core of the film but feels like just another drug-fueled party scam . worse still is the contrived drama in the relationship between colin and harmony , which takes a "" hip , "" independent film sort of turn for the worse . the acting is servicable at best , the characterizations not even that . groove is composed entirely of people doing the sort of thing one sees people do at raves , played with all the energy and commitment of people playing types -- you're the uncomfortable geek , you're the dealer , you're the party princess , and so on . the issue isn't that groove meanders along in its night-in-the-life way without trying to be particularly profound . dazed and confused and american graffiti were charming studies of its era's revellers , and no one much cared if an epiphany was to be found . both of those films , however , had the benefit of a nostalgic distance , allowing both film-maker and audience to recognize the silliness inherent in youthful celebration . greg harrison is too serious about this milieu ; he seems to be making the suggestion that kids really have found party nirvana this time , not like those goofy kids of the '60s , '70s and '80s . it's no wonder the characters are irrelevant ; harrison just needed bodies to jump up and down to the beat . his take on the rave scene , detailed though it may be , isn't dazed and confused for the '90s . it's thank god it's friday for the '90s . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1365,"watching the cell is akin to watching a demo reel for the film's art directors , makeup artists , production designer and costume designer -- which , i'm sure , it will end up being . make no mistake about it , the cell is the kind of film technical craftspeople lie awake fantasizing about . the result can be the eye-popping stuff of oscar nominations ( and wins ) , a film people walk away from thinking what all art directors , makeup artists , production designers and costume designers secretly want viewers to walk away thinking : "" boy , that looked incredible . "" the cell does look incredible , and since it is evident in nearly every frame that its primary purpose for existing is to look incredible , i suppose you'd have to say that it works in its own strange way . if only that look seemed less familiar , or more resonant . the procedure has yielded only the slightest success , but it becomes the best chance for f . b . i . first-time feature director tarsem singh ( director of music videos like r . e . m . 's "" losing my religion "" ) is clearly going for a silence of the lambs-meets-seven vibe , a commercially wise decision given the financial success of those films . there are heroes with their own demons to banish , interactions between killer and profiler , a screaming woman to be saved , some stark desert landscapes and some grisly images you'll just want to purge from your brain . the parts are right , but they're not put together in a way that adds up to anything . both deane and novak get 30-second character development moments to explain their motivations , including a provocative hint at novak's own dark childhood , while most of the film treats them like props to throw into stargher's messed-up head . considering the film takes nearly an hour to throw them there -- spending an inordinate amount of time on the police work that locates stargher , when that's not really the point of the story -- the fuzzy characterizations are eminently noticeable . singh's shots are often effectively disorienting , including one arcing shot that ends with the camera swinging upside down into water . many of the nightmare concepts ( a hideous bit of psycho-torture ) and directing tricks with which singh dresses up his film are utterly unique ; nearly as many are stuff out of intro to music video auteurs' freaky surrealist visuals . eventually , it becomes difficult to take the cell seriously , because so much of the imagery feels cribbed from 20 years of mtv . the 1984 dennis quaid fantasy dreamscape at least found some fun in walking through another person's psyche . the cell is supposed to be terrifying , but when a serial killer's mindscape resembles an s&m variation on a robert palmer video , his power to intimidate can't help but diminish . the juxtaposition of the two stories allows each protagonist the opportunity to get a big dramatic moment . unfortunately , they have nothing whatsoever to do with one another , which is yet another example of the cell's fundamentally flawed storytelling -- it takes far too long to get into its central concept , then tries to make up for that mistake by lingering there once it's already served its purpose . i didn't necessarily expect the cell to be a film that would stand up to much scrutiny . i did expect something that would provide the shock of the new . singh and his crew don't provide enough that's shockingly new to make up for the cell's lapses as a narrative . boy , the cell's visuals looked incredible . . . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1366,"rain man was not about dustin hoffman's raymond babbitt . there are some who find the film overly sentimental , and others who consider hoffman's oscar-winning performance little more than a gimmick , but it's hard to argue that the basic structure of the story wasn't what it had to be . raymond couldn't be that character , because it's absurd to build a narrative around the idea that someone with a profound emotional/psychological condition can decide through a simple act of will to be better . this lesson is offered to explain why chuck & buck , for all the quirky things it does right , is ultimately an experience somewhere between improbable and downright insulting . there's a lot of interesting stuff built into the premise , including a not-particularly-twisty twist that still generates a bit more interest in the chuck/buck dynamic . white's performance as buck is pitched just right , somewhere between endearing and creepy in his striped t-shirt and perpetually blow-pop-stuffed grin . director miguel arteta's choice of digital video seems an ill-advised one dramatically -- why heighten the immediacy and realism of a story centered around somebody's fantasy world ? -- but the technology and hand-held movement are rarely distracting . throw in an infectiously innocuous theme song to set the tone , and you've got the raw material for some solid whacked-out drama and dark comedy . and that raw material is left to rot . but charlie is a huge sucking black hole of a characterization , left utterly bereft of personality or motivations in chris weitz's performance and white's script . he's merely a target of obsession , carelessly created because white never intends for the story to be about anything but buck . chuck & buck's resolution is centered around the idea that 15 years of juvenile infantilism are as easy to toss off as a striped t-shirt . chuck & buck's saving grace is a sub-plot that ultimately has little to do with the ostensibly main plot -- buck's attempt to mount a production of a play he has written about his childhood friendship , called hank & frank . a short film entirely about the play within the play might have been great fun , unburdened by the need for grand third-act shifts of character . chuck & buck sinks thanks to a fundamental misunderstanding of how to structure a plot with a plausible character arc . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1367,"screenplay : tom s . parker & jim jennewein and steven e . de souza . director : brian levant . i decided to try something different for the flintstones . i put aside my critical notebook and tried to clear my mind of all preconceptions : the thirty-two writers who worked on the script ; the mind-numbing marketing blitz ; the dread at the appearance of yet another tv retread . and i resolved to let it be what it would be , to tell myself , norman vincent peale-like , "" i will enjoy this film on its own level . "" do you know what ? it almost worked . as silly , clunky and repetitive as the flintstones may be , it's still something of a guilty pleasure , at least on a visual level . while it's no film for the ages , neither is it a modern stone-age travesty . it's tempting to call the flintstones imaginative , but there really wouldn't seem to be all that much imagination involved in directly transferring the animated series to live action . every house , every costume , even every sound effect is instantly recognizable to anyone who grew up with "" the flintstones "" either in first run or syndication . of course , that is the logic behind the glut of tv-based films : bring in that elusive older audience with the nostalgia/recognition factor . if my audience was any indication , it's working with the flintstones . while the kids screeched with delight at the slapstick , the biggest laugh from the adults was reserved for rosie o'donnell's pitch-perfect duplication of betty's trademark giggle . i generally found myself entertained while i took in the production design and admired its whimsical authenticity . there is , however , one major problem with the casting , and it comes as quite a surprise . physically , he pulls his punches more often than not , as though he didn't understand just how far overboard he should go in a live action cartoon ; in his delivery , he struggles with the blustering voice originated by alan reed , and appears to be re-routing it through jackie gleason ( whose "" honeymooners "" character ralph kramden was the model for fred flintstone ) . goodman's relatively weak fred unfortunately overshadows his solid castmates . rick moranis is an appealingly amiable barney , and rosie o'donnell , while not ideal physically as betty , had the mannerisms down pat . and it may be worth the price of admission just to see elizabeth taylor , as wilma's mother , tied up and gagged and lying on the ground . one interesting by-product came out of seeing the flintstones : i realized that i had under-appreciated the addams family films . like those films , the flintstones primarily offers as its humor variations on a single theme . but the addams outings at least seemed occasionally inspired ; the flintstones is content just to show up and toss off the expected "" rock "" and "" stone "" puns . this is especially disconcerting when a flintstones franchise may be as close to a sure thing as there is in hollywood . the first time around , the flintstones' visuals are a light-hearted kick , but there's nothing more to do . i could write that sequel given a day and a half . . .

1368,"all right , i'm not saying people flocked to white men can't jump or indecent proposal thanks to his name above the title . nevertheless , harrelson has demonstrated an enviable talent for picking hits , even if that has been the only thing he has really demonstrated in his fledgling big screen career . the cowboy way is in for a much harder ride towards success , facing stiff summer competition , but whatever its box office take , there might be more in it for harrelson to be proud of personally than any of his previous films . given the challenge of carrying a film for the first time , he takes a tedious formula picture and singlehandedly makes it at least moderately endearing . i could easily name fifty variations on this particular theme which have graced the screen since i have been a regular movie-goer ; fish-out-of-water comedy is as venerable a genre as the western itself . the cowboy way fits every one perfectly creating that comfortable familiarity filmmakers seek much more frequently than originality . the tweaks to that formula the cowboy way incorporates run from the obvious ( the friendly cop has a romance with cowboy mythology ) to the mildly interesting ( dylan mcdermott's insecure villain ) , but let's be frank . the cowboy way does not , nor was it meant to , dazzle with its inventiveness . in fact , there are long stretches when it's a crashing bore . the showpiece here is the energetic performance of woody harrelson , who has a great deal of fun with the lovably oafish pepper . in many ways , the cowboy way plays like little more than a series of setups for pepper to do something stupid , which could have been a nightmare if so many of those stupid things weren't so funny . as long as harrelson was on the screen , the cowboy way kept me smiling . if only there was one interesting person for him to interact with . kiefer sutherland continues to show that screen presence is a recessive sutherland family trait , reading every line as though he had something on the stove that he really needed to get back to . sonny is supposed to be level-headed , but sutherland interprets "" level-headed "" as "" comatose , "" much as he did in last year's the three musketeers . the cowboy way is a tired premise filled with tired-looking actors , but woody harrelson was able to lasso me by the neck and take me along for the ride . i'd like to see a home video version where the plot is edited out entirely ; it just ends up getting in harrelson's way .

1369,"mpaa rating : unrated ( could be pg-13 for brief nudity , profanity ) running time : 89 minutes . that , unfortunately , is what prevents barenaked in america from being a particularly interesting film experience . the ladies are presented by priestley as a group of nice , intelligent guys having loads of fun entertaining their fans , almost completely unfazed by their sudden notoriety in america . great stuff for a people magazine profile ; not so much for a feature documentary . chalk it up to bad luck , perhaps , but the time frame for priestley's profile is all wrong . start the story a few months earlier , and you may have something : a hard-working bunch of decent guys swooping back and forth between the highest highs and the lowest lows . as it actually unfolds , barenaked in america is utterly bereft of drama . which is not to say that it's utterly bereft of entertainment . even viewers who are not bnl devotees will find it hard to deny the energetic appeal of their stage shows , which turn into rowdy audience-participation improvisations . unfortunately , barenaked in america isn't a straight-ahead concert film . it's not really clear exactly what priestley wants it to be , in fact . there are token bits of archival footage , but not enough to provide a sense of where the ladies came from . there are moments of backstage and person-on-the-street cavorting , but not enough to make the film a showcase for the band members' off-stage charm . and there are token glimpses of the easy-going fellows putting their feet down on business decisions ( like their dissatisfaction with a video for their follow-up single "" it's all been done "" ) , but they feel completely incongruous with most of the film pitched lighter than air . occasionally priestley takes an off-beat angle , like letting both fans and detractors of the band speak their minds after hearing bnl music . far more often , he simply turns on his camera like a buddy of the band making a home movie . these guys were never going to yield a spinal tap-like story of internal meltdown and rampant ego ; it would have taken a much more skilled documentarian and a much more precise time frame to make a barenaked ladies film soar . the band itself deserves the attention , because talented pop musicians and songwriters with a zeal for showmanship are in too short supply to dismiss them as a novelty act . if anything positive comes from barenaked in america , it might be encouraging more people to know the band from its live shows . that's the barenaked experience that should be recorded for posterity . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"" it was far from clear that pay it forward would make for a great film ; there were a lot of plot threads to condense , and a definite danger of pollyanna overkill . but there was something primally satisfying about the whole idea of it , and a kicker of a finale that was a true tear-jerker on the page . great , not necessarily ; hanky-wringing and applause-inducing , most definitely . maybe a fable like pay it forward could only have worked on the page . more likely , maybe it only could have worked with a director who knew how to tell an inherently emotional story with some degree of subtlety . his classmates scoff at his optimism , but eugene is intrigued by trevor's idea . much has been made of the fact that the kevin spacey character was african-american in the novel , but pay it forward isn't ineffective because it's not faithful enough . there are quite a few things to like about the film , from helen hunt's willingness to look positively ghastly , to the use of the las vegas setting . and of course there's kevin spacey , who can always be counted on to dazzle even when the material is less than stellar . he's a fascinating screen performer , and here he gets at the hope buried in a bitter man . that's what spacey can do even when a director seems to be working against him . leder excelled as a small screen director for "" e . r . , "" but in pay it forward , as in deep impact , she once again misses every opportunity to make the film about more than its concept . granted , dixon's script is better with individual moments than it is at building a narrative , but leder makes a flawed script even worse . every shot involving a human face involves a close-up so intense you can count pores ; supporting characters -- notably jon bon jovi as trevor's absentee dad -- aren't given a chance to develop beyond a single note . leder's editing choices rob the moment of all its power , including pointless cutaway's to hunt's reaction shots . every time a scene calls for finding a core of emotional honesty , leder opts instead to convey sincerity by blowing up haley joel osment's head to the size of a dirigible and letting the tears roll down his pouting face . plenty of opponents of pay it forward will probably fixate on the film's final shot , which borrows blatantly from another feel-good film that shall remain nameless . once again , the problem isn't that it differs from the novel's climax ; it isn't even that it's familiar from another film . the problem is that it's simply a movie moment , one that ignores that the payoff in pay it forward should be the success or failure of trevor's idea . it's manipulative and overwrought , but the real issue is that it's not organic to the story . leder spends two hours grasping for how to tell this story visually , and almost never comes up with the appropriate choice . pay it forward is still bound to leave some viewers thinking they've seen a good film , just because it leaves them a little teary-eyed . i doubt many of them will feel any resonance from those tears 24 hours later . you managed to screw it up big time . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"" jim carter , in his tex cobb-circa-raising arizona wardrobe , makes for a good nasty-comic villain , and the script ( co-written by chicken run and james and the giant peach scribe karey kirkpatrick ) includes at least a few clever lines like , "" it's not easy for a father to hear , but your son is a blood-sucking fiend .

1372,"screenplay : jeremy leven , based on the novel by steven pressfield . director : robert redford . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , wartime violence ) running time : 125 minutes . philosophy generally makes for godawful cinema . steven pressfield's novel the legend of bagger vance seemed like a terribly unlikely candidate for a film translation , because it wasn't really a novel . combined with a mash note to the game of golf , wrapped loosely around a period narrative . there was no way pressfield's book could be turned into an engaging film . then again , that's what people said about norman maclean's a river runs through it , and somehow director robert redford managed to turn that book into a pretty solid film . but how would a text comprised primarily of mystical lessons and play-by-play from the links be rendered on screen ? redford's adaptation of the legend of bagger vance radically re-imagines pressfield's novel to make it a more palatable screen story . in so doing , he rips out its soul and leaves a fairly bland sports drama in its place . it's easy to see the logic behind most of screenwriter jeremy leven's decisions in adapting bagger vance . the story is streamlined into a tale of redemption and lost love regained , and the climax is rendered as a nigh-mythical clash of titans . it's all quite clean and efficient , with all the prosaic descriptions of transcendentally significant dogleg lefts and most of the revelatory visions left on the page . in fact , it's so clean and efficient that it hardly registers as a drama at all . while pressfield's novel wasn't terribly concerned with making his characters genuinely complex , it didn't really matter contextually . leven and redford don't add much to that complexity , and here it matters a lot . redford is too concerned with making the atmosphere mystical to give junuh's pain an earthly urgency , and matt damon's performance suffers as a result . charlize theron gets to weep a bit , but adele has "" romantic interest "" written all over her from the outset . will smith does fine , relaxed work as bagger , but his importance as a spiritual teacher is diminished with his teachings reduced to fortune cookie-sized aphorisms . bagger vance was not going to work on the screen with twenty minute sermons on the authentic swing ; it makes perfect sense to shift the focus to the characters . it makes no sense to shift the focus , then still leave the characters underdeveloped . as usual , redford directs a technically accomplished piece of work , beautifully photographed by michael ballhaus and smoothly edited . there's simply no weight to any of it , despite the intrusively heavy score by rachel portman . instead of a meditation on a personal journey to enlightenment told through the unique nature of the game of golf , the film becomes a period piece with a few appealing performances . what remains is a film about whether or not junuh will win the big golf match and/or win the girl . and while it's competently rendered , it's not exactly the matter of cosmic import the film builds it up to be . you can't blame a filmmaker for radically altering a text as inherently uncinematic as the legend of bagger vance . redford , however , alters it to the point that you wonder why he bothered to make it at all . he understood that philosophy generally makes for godawful cinema . he didn't understand that without the philosophy , or rich characterizations to replace it , the legend of bagger vance just barely breaks par . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1374,"i thought to myself . it was not for want of action that i questioned the lineage of true lies ; indeed , cameron continues to define the state of the art in the genre . but was this the same man who created some of the strongest female characters in recent memory , producing such a mean-spirited and misogynist throwback to the glory days of james bond ? although parts of true lies work extremely well , its long detour into an unnecessary and unpleasant sub-plot left me with a very bad taste in my mouth . i compared true lies to the james bond films , and those comparisons are both for good and bad . not that it's a problem ; the scene is sharply executed , and complemented by the surprisingly entertaining supporting work of tom arnold as harry's partner gib . however , it holds out promise for a witty film based on action set pieces , and that's not exactly what develops . instead , true lies takes a sharp left turn into farce , and for nearly half an hour becomes an entirely different film . for all its flash and star power , this segment of true lies plays like little more than a $100 million episode of "" three's company . "" but it's not just that it is contrived and interrupts the flow of the film . it also features harry treating his wife with an astonishing level of mental cruelty , and it's all played for laughs . with another , more plain-looking actor , this treatment might have come off as more light-hearted . schwarzenegger , however , simply looks too angry , and scenes like harry's interrogation of helen which had most of the audience howling with delight had me literally cringing . the spectacular final hour of true lies is almost enough to tip the balance back in its favor . the digital effects which enhance a harrier jet assault on a miami highrise are spectacular , and the pyrotechnics are dynamic . but i could never lose myself in true lies because of the jarring shifts between broad comedy and big action . it may be a funnier , more technically proficient film than hudson hawk , but it belongs in the same genre : the multi-million dollar caper . for many viewers , all that will matter is that arnold fires of a couple hundred thousand rounds , a bridge blows up , and there are some solid laughs . for me , a film like true lies could only work with a lighter touch and considerably less of a nasty edge . with cameron delivering so many of his jokes through clenched teeth , i found true lies depressing almost as often as i found it fun .

1375,"mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 117 minutes . and then the movie ends . thornton and miramax feuded for a year over the length of the film , with the director originally turning in a two-and-a-half hour cut before finally paring it down to under two hours . the resulting film is the best evidence that thornton was right . all the pretty horses is a film that wants to achieve an epic scope , but where plot points keep rolling by so quickly that there's no time for anything to resonate . it's a picturesque travelogue made for short attention span theatre . and the complications progress from there . one of the most impressive elements of cormac mccarthy's novel was how he was able to take such a plot-heavy story and make it feel rich and profound . ted tally's script retains the laconic cowboy dialogue , but the structure is a mess . the set-up concerning john grady's fragmented family is dispatched in a few snippets of film and some voice-over , providing little foundation for the journey that is to come . in some earlier incarnation , tally may have provided more fleshing out for the individual story elements , more gradual build-up for the drama . in the two hours all the pretty horses now takes on screen , there's a sense in virtually every scene that someone was standing over the editor's shoulder , tapping his watch and muttering , "" come on , we gotta get to the skinny-dipping come on , we gotta get to the knife fight . "" the really unfortunate part is that you can see a quality film screaming to get loose . thomas is also solid , and lucas black grabs the screen in his smaller role as the high-strung blevins . it's easy to understand what the film-makers are reaching for in their exploration of a changing country and the disappearance of a slower , simpler way of life . it's far more difficult to get caught up in those themes while trying to keep up with the latest dramatic development in john grady's life . ordinarily , it might be worth commending all the pretty horses for not arbitrarily turning the romantic sub-plot into the entire focus of the film ( though it's still the entire focus of the ad campaign ) . this isn't really a story about john grady doin' the hoochie-coochie with his little senorita , and while penelope cruz is quite scrumptious to look at , she doesn't exactly create a complex character . it's a bit of a surprise when the film moves along for another twenty minutes or so of loose-end-tying after the love story has been resolved , but in this case , it doesn't feel like a daring or unconventional choice . it simply feels like another example of a film that's almost never in the moment , so desperate to dash off that you suspect the whole crew was renting its equipment by the minute . so much for a celebration of a slower , simpler way of life . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1376,"screenplay : steve martin . director : gillies mackinnon . his script for roxanne retained only the most basic plot elements , while ditching the tragedy . with a simple twist of fate , he has been perhaps too faithful , letting a deliberate exposition and somber tone dull a potentially appealing redemption tale . there is something jarring about watching a film constructed like a 19th century novel set in the present day . a simple twist of fate takes its own sweet time establishing its plot and characters , and for the first half hour it seems muted to the point of inaudibility , and very dark in its tone . but curiously , the one thing missing from this overlong first act is any sense of who michael mccann really is . he is viewed mostly through the reactions of townspeople , or filmed in shadow hoarding his precious gold coins . i felt that i knew more about characters like newland's wayward brother ( stephen baldwin ) than the man whose transformation is to provide the centerpiece for the film . to be fair to steve martin the screenwriter , steve martin the actor may not have been the best choice for this role . for the past couple of years , in such films as leap of faith , martin has been trying to establish himself as a legitimate dramatic actor , and while he is always an appealing presence , he just doesn't look comfortable in scenes which require serious emotion . his standard "" repressed emotion "" take is on frequent display in a simple twist of fate , and it usually just makes him look slightly constipated . at those moments , i just couldn't lose myself in the pre-mathilda mccann . there is much more to enjoy in the second act of simple twist . martin is very good as the nervous novice father , and his scenes with the various child actors playing mathilda are generally quite charming . also appealing are the performances of catherine o'hara as a quirky antique shop owner who befriends mccann ( and , in a pleasant surprise , * doesn't * become his romantic interest ) , and gabriel byrne , slipping in and out of a virginia accent but providing some nice shading for a part that could have been a stock villain . unfortunately , the conclusion of a simple twist of fate becomes a predictable and overlong custody battle , complete with courtroom scenes and a hissable lawyer . the more melodramatic a simple twist of fate became--and ironically , the more like its source material-- the less effective it was as a film . as nicely as the bonding between father and daughter was portrayed , it couldn't compensate for the plodding story on either end of it .

1377,"screenplay : mark verheiden . director : peter hyams . a muscular action hero with a thick accent stars in a science fiction film about traveling into the past to change the future . no , i'm not talking about the terminator , although i suspect the similarity is more than coincidental . jean-claude van damme has labored through several virtually indistinguishable testosterone fests without discovering his breakout hit , so timecop must have seemed like the perfect opportunity . and it will probably do what it was intended to do , expanding van damme's audience the way the terminator expanded arnold schwarzenegger's . it's an energetic film that doesn't skimp on the action , but it suffers from an over-convoluted storyline that pushes the logic meter * way * into the red zone . however , those are not the issues which hamper timecop most . there is more fundamental foolishness , like what exactly the t . e . c . either there has been an inordinate number of rogue timecops , or there was a spectacular level of stupidity involved in not destroying the other machine . one also wonders why assassins from the future can't be slightly less obtrusive than extras from the road warrior . while reuben is good working with sketchy material , the character appears too late and disappears too soon to leave any kind of impact on the story . everything about the fielding character feels contrived , sloppy and , worst of all , completely unnecessary . director peter hyams went a little nuts in the editing room , making some of van damme's fight scenes look like they were lit with a strobe , but they are mostly creative and well- choreographed ; only the final showdown drags on a bit . the special effects are sharp , and the computer-generated snap-back look to the characters' movements through time is inventive and well-handled . the production values are generally impressive , and action fans will not be too disappointed . the real pleasant surprise of timecop turns out to be the acting of jean-claude van damme . yes , that's right , i said acting . though still sometimes difficult to understand through his belgian accent , van damme is an appealing performer who looks comfortable on screen , something steven seagal has yet to accomplish . timecop isn't exactly a demanding film for an actor , but van damme shows that he can provide texture , something a bit more substantive than roundhouse kicks . he also gets to work off a suitably nasty villain in ron silver , who is perfectly cast , and has a nice chemistry with the too-little-seen mia sara . it's too bad timecop often feels bloated and preposterous , because there's a bit of heart lurking beneath the hardware . it's just a bit too uneven to take advantage of its strengths .

1378,"screenplay : denis o'neil . meryl streep has proved to be an actor impossible to pigeonhole . now streep has gotten serious again , but this time in the context of an action-suspense thriller . the river wild gives streep the chance to flex new muscles ( literally and artistically ) , and while she continues to be one of the most talented actors alive , she is failed here by a script which is thoroughly by-the-numbers . there is something to be said simply for the opportunity to watch meryl streep perform . she manages to convey not only her anger at wade for threatening her family , but a subtle seduction in the attempt to convince him and a genuine frustration that she isn't good enough to make this journey even if she wanted to . it was because of scenes like that that my attention never completely wandered as long as streep was on the screen , and she is almost always on the screen . the problem is that most of the elements surrounding her aren't one-tenth as interesting . denis o'neil's script goes exactly where you expect it to go exactly when you expect it to go there , a story any movie of the week could come up with . strathairn is solid , but has little to do ; kevin bacon has a lot to do , and does most of it poorly . he's too stupid and not crazy enough when he needs to be most threatening , and there's not all that much conflict involved when the only thing the villain has over the protagonists is a gun . director curtis hanson directs in a workmanlike manner , trotting out such suspense film standbys as the old "" pet leaps out to the accompaniment of a blast of music "" trick . it frequently seems as though he sees the family conflict storyline as something in the way , something to be pushed through to get to the rafting sequences . to be fair , those sequences are exciting . cinematographer robert elswit's camera swoops and dives , and there is a genuine sense of danger . the location scenery is also magnificent , filmed on rivers in oregon and montana , and helps fill in many of the dead spots . but the river wild is too often the river mild , a mediocre melodrama gifted with the presence of one great actor .

1379,"starring : robert deniro , kenneth branagh , helena bonham carter . screenplay : steph lady and frank darabont . director : kenneth branagh . in the first place , this is * not * mary shelley's frankenstein . as iconic and thematically fascinating as shelley's novel might be , it is unfilmable as written , a rambling piece more notable for long philosophical musings than for any action one would consider cinematically ideal . no , while this version may be more faithful than most , it is really kenneth branagh's frankenstein , and therein lies its crucial failing . while ostensibly attempting to stay close to shelley's often tedious narrative , branagh is more frequently indulging his bombastic filmmaking style , giving us the gee-whiz camera work of dead again without any of that film's sense of fun . there are a truckload of bad decisions involved in mary shelley's frankenstein , but the most glaring might be branagh casting himself as the good mad doctor . as talented a shakespearean stage actor as he is , he is also a shakespearean stage actor on film . victor frankenstein is a character defined by torment , but branagh's version of torment often consists of howling and tearing at his hair . the screenplay by steph lady and frank darabont does far too little to establish the oedipal subtext which is the basis for frankenstein's obsession , making branagh's reaction to his mother's death look comically overboard . when nearly a full hour goes by before the creature plays a significant role , frankenstein's characterization needs to be developed more consistently and subtly , and branagh can't pull it off . he also seems to direct that first hour without any thought of the audience . it's true that he's dealing with a script that leap-frogs over twenty years in the first ten minutes , but branagh's editing choices are baffling . the opening sequence , which takes place on a ship in the arctic , is so loud and fast that it borders on the incoherent ; the next twenty minutes are a crashing bore . frankenstein always looks impressive , particularly the mammoth stairway of the frankenstein manor which seems to take on a life of its own , but until the creation sequence branagh spends an awful lot of time doing precious little but creating atmosphere as precociously as possible . the creation sequence does signal a significant improvement in frankenstein , and that is largely due to the surprisingly expressive performance of robert deniro as the creature . even under mounds of gruesome latex , deniro gives the creature an interior life , and some of the scenes which focus on his interaction with a peasant family are extremely touching . but he is frequently failed by branagh's direction , because branagh doesn't want to concentrate on the story's philosophical underpinnings--he wants to film an opera . there are moments of undeniable power in mary shelley's frankenstein , including a horrifying sequence involving the creation of a bride for the creature , and they are so strong that they almost make up for the flotsam between them . unfortunately , for the most part frankenstein the movie ends up a lot like the creature itself : alternately lumbering and chaotic , and a patchwork mess .

1380,"screenplay : anne rice . and both were the subject of intense pre-release scrutiny as a result of off-beat casting decisions . however , the most relevant--and unfortunate--similarity between the two is what ends up on the screen . interview with the vampire is a spectacularly executed production , perhaps more consistent in its tone than frankenstein , but it also lacks that film's high points ; it's simply too plot-heavy , and ends up feeling extremely rushed . first , to the single most pressing question to anyone familiar with anne rice's novel : is tom cruise an acceptable lestat ? the answer is , sometimes . there are moments , and not isolated ones , where cruise is positively fiendish , more so than one could have any right to hope . he has said in interviews that he grew to hate playing the depressive vampire , and that fact is sadly evident in his performance , a dazed and lackluster turn . she becomes the tortured soul whose plight truly connects with the audience in a way that louis's should have , but never does . of course , this is one of the dangers inherent in doing a big hollywood adaptation of what is essentially an interior monologue . director neil jordan has filmed the story beautifully , busing philippe rousselot's cinematography to perfection , and scenes like the theater of vampires production are nearly ideal translations from the novel . the production design is magnificent , and elliot goldenthal's score is a great mood setter . it looks so good that occasionally i could overlook the fact that in their rush to pack as much plot as possible into two hours , jordan and rice had severely skimped on their characters' motivations . this is not to say that there haven't been some significant improvements made from the novel , particularly adding some much-needed black humor . but for interview with the vampire to work as anything besides simply spectacle , louis had to becomes something besides a pouting immortal , and lestat had to be something more than a sporadically zany eternal adolescent . interview with the vampire ends up positively gorgeous , and extremely hollow .

1381,"director : michael apted . screenplay : william nicholson and mark handley . the pre-release buzz over jodie foster's performance in nell tells you two things about this year's academy awards race . first , it's another abysmal year for female leading roles when people can't think of any worthy nominees and start to hype a performance two months before anyone has seen it . second , it's another year when overcoming a disability is virtually the express lane to a nomination . what it doesn't tell you is how good foster actually is in nell , and that is simply good , and far from great . nell as a whole is even less successful , a well-acted but unremarkable film which makes a couple of profound missteps . director michael apted has demonstrated an affinity for films set in the south ( coal miner's daughter ) and films about culture clashes ( thunderheart ) , so he would seem like a good fit for nell . indeed , he is mostly on target . he and cinematographer dante spinotti ( who collaborated on the visually imaginative blink earlier this year ) create some marvelous images of the beautiful locations , in clear deep blues , and there are a few extremely effective scenes of nell reacting to a strange new world . however , he makes at least one truly awful choice . the problem with nell is deeper than that one error , however . thematically , it's simply the elephant man in a log cabin : "" civilized people "" discover "" freak "" and learn that "" freak "" is more human than any of the "" civilized people . "" unfortunately , nell is not nearly as subtle or engrossing as the elephant man . the script , by william ( shadowlands ) nicholson and mark handley from handley's own play , would have been better as a mystery than as the morality play it becomes , but apted's one false move robs it of that mystery . by the time we get to the climactic scene in which nell delivers the kind of courtroom speech which makes courtroom scenes so generally annoying in contemporary films , she has become too much the noble savage and not nearly human enough . jodie foster is a wonderful actress , but there's really only so much she can do with this part . though it seems tailor-made for a heap of awards , nell surprisingly fails to generate much emotional resonance . physically , foster does som superb acting ; she lets this character inhabit her entire body . it just often seems as though she is concentrating so hard on her part that she's not making connections with the other actors . liam neeson and natasha richardson are both solid as the feuding doctors , but they come to parts which have the kind of pre-fabricated back stories that come out in tearful speeches , a frequent flaw of playwrights turned screenwriters . their relationship feels contrived , which is a true shame considering neeson and richardson's real-life romance . that development is like a lot of nell : awkward , even as it looks great .

1382,"though poetic justice was a misfire , boyz showed that singleton could tell a story , and after nearly ten years around stanford , one of the nation's hotbeds of multicultural experimentation , i knew that there were many stories to tell . higher learning shows that singleton recognized that fact as well ; unfortunately , he tried to tell them all in one movie . it's an ambitious but unfocused effort which is admirable for its balanced perspective but leaves critical characters as mere representations of the stereotypes it seems to be challenging . for fully half of its running time , higher learning appears to be headed in the right direction . unlike contemporaries oliver stone and spike lee , singleton does know how to present challenging and controversial subject matter without shouting at the top of his lungs in every frame . in a stone film , the hero's two mentors would be manifestations of good and evil ; singleton , on the other hand , makes both fudge and professor phipps smart and sensible characters , leaving the audience to draw its own conclusions . it doesn't hurt that both roles are played by magnetic screen presences . ice cube has true star potential , a powerful personality and a fine actor , and he keeps fudge from being simply a spouter of dogma . laurence fishburne's phipps doesn't really need a west indian accent , but he shows a genuine concern for malik , and also keeps his speeches from sounding didactic . malik's storyline is the most carefully plotted , and omar epps' fine performance as the young man weighing two views of being black in america makes it the most interesting to watch . but singleton fails to give his other two principles the same kind of depth . his story could have been an opportunity to examine why real , intelligent young people feel so threatened in a multi-cultural society , but he's pushed so far to the fringe that he becomes a cartoon . the problems with those two characters are representative of what is most wrong with higher learning , particularly in its second half . higher learning is awash in good intentions , but too often it's terribly simplistic , taking a story which should have been about the shaping of minds and reducing it to a matter of who's got the guns .

1383,"screenplay : rafael yglesias and ariel dorfman . director : roman polanski . one of 1994's most unintentionally hilarious films was the adaptation of isabel allende's the house of the spirits , a bloated epic in which jeremy irons , meryl streep , glenn close and winona ryder were supposed to be playing latin americans . it baffled me that such casting could take place in an age where an anglo playing any other race would incite riots , and the casting of spirits was ultimately much of its undoing . roman polanski has made the same choice with death and the maiden , and again it was a very bad one . while as a concept death and the maiden is strong and intriguing enough to maintain interest , it is sabotaged by actors who often appear not to have the faintest idea what to do with the material . the psychological underpinnings of death and the maiden are a complex set of relationships and interactions which make for an extremely promising story . at its heart is paulina's conviction in miranda's guilt , a conviction which we should always doubt because of her paranoia and unreliability . unfortunately , as it plays out , the performances and direction make our choice far too easy for us . sigourney weaver is part of the problem , playing paulina not just over the top ( which is probably where the role should be ) but so far over the top that she falls off the top . weaver as a personality simply seems too strong to be so close to complete breakdown , so she makes up for it by contorting her face and snarling . he plays miranda as such a little weasel that if he's not guilty of this particular crime , we figure he must be guilty of _something_ . the part requires more ambiguity , and the very talented kingsley just doesn't deliver in this case . perhaps even more disappointing is the relationship between paulina and gerardo , which is remarkably intricate . all this is in the text , but somehow director roman polanski doesn't let it out . paulina never seems to love gerardo , while gerardo is mostly befuddled . the moments when they do reveal themselves , all in very stagy speeches , ring hollow because the same truths should have been evident in the performances . one scene shows what might have been , late in the film when kingsley makes a confession . polanski holds a very long take on kingsley , refusing to cut to weaver's reaction , and at that moment you genuinely wonder whether this is a guilty man spilling his guts or an innocent man giving the performance of a lifetime to save his skin . but moments later , polanski cops out with a too-obvious resolution . the performances in death and the maiden should have created a mystery . instead , the mystery is why they couldn't make the material work .

1384,"honestly , if i never see another courtroom scene in a movie , it will be too soon . as soon as i see a witness stand , a couple of guys in suits , and twelve good persons and true , i know i'm in for nothing less than a good old-fashioned lecture . it's jello drama : ready instantly , but usually without much texture . murder in the first has an inherently interesting story at its core , but its makers don't know what to do with it except dress it up in cliches and impress us with cinematographic gymnastics . it's not a bad film ; it's just lazy , a classic example of a writer and director failing to make the most of an idea's potential . murder in the first opens with a risky but effective sequence which shows henri's treatment while in the "" dungeon . "" the sequence goes on for several minutes , but it is necessary considering how much henri's state of mind comes into play . in fact , director marc rocco doesn't really go far enough . the torture sequences are too romanticized , filmed in slow-motion and backlit like an s&m version of flashdance , when it would have been more appropriate to play the scenes straight so that henri's plight seemed more real . it is a lack of restraint typical of rocco's direction , which looks like he put cinematographer fred murphy in a gyroscope and just set him spinning . you get the impression that rocco thinks this story is basically about crane shots and funky angles . what it should have been about , first and foremost , is the relationship between henri and stamphill , but again rocco and screenwriter dan gordon don't take advantage of opportunities . it's too much a case of the tail wagging the dog , such that by the end of murder in the first i didn't feel the friendship between these two men which should have created its greatest emotional impact . that said , the scenes between bacon and slater are the best thing about murder in the first . though bacon's performance is occasionally indulgent , coming off like renfield with a midwestern twang , he is mostly extremely affecting . it is by far the meatiest role he has had , and he is effective at maintaining the shred of humanity behind henri's glassy stare . one scene in particular , in which slater compares the punishment he received for stealing five dollars to henri's , is a great piece of work because rocco lets the inherent power of the moment work . murder in the first , which should have been most about a connection between two very different men , instead becomes a shouting match , and by trying to make his film important with a capital "" i , "" marc rocco instead makes it mediocre with a capital "" m .

1385,"the line between homage and cinematic plagiarism can be a fairly fine one , and largely a matter of perception . then there are directors who quote so frequently and so freely from their idols that it becomes an exercise in supreme critical generosity not to say that the sincerest form of flattery has become a faded photocopy of a great work of art . this week's winner of the brian depalma memorial award for stylistic cannibalism is david frankel , whose miami rhapsody , though frequently amusing , is such a blatant and second-rate ersatz woody allen film that it might as well have been called miami hall . all these revelations force gwyn to consider whether the compromises necessary in marriage are worth it all . frankel has crafted a fairly simple story on which to hang his witty observations about modern marriage , and has created an interesting character to act as tour guide . gwyn is a smart and funny woman , but an overthinker who uses her cutting remarks to keep people at a distance . sarah jessica parker is an extremely appealing actress , and she is full of energy and sparkle in this role . her character is so obviously a gender-transferred version of woody allen's compulsively self-analytical intellectual that every word out of her mouth seems just horribly wrong , or a really misguided impression . i kept waiting for parker to put on a pair of horn-rims and be done with it . if only that were the only thing frankel cribs from allen . miami rhapsody opens with a jazz score over credits on a black screen , with cast listings in alphabetical order . sound familiar ? it should if you've seen any woody allen film in the last fifteen years . there are several lines and concepts taken whole cloth from annie hall : a reference to the fact that "" love fades ; "" gwyn's final comments on relationships which are remarkably similar to woody allen's "" we need the eggs "" rationalization at the end of annie hall ; even an oblique reference to the original title of annie hall ( anhedonia , or aversion to pleasure ) in gwyn's line , "" i'm just terrified of anything good that might happen to me . "" with every sardonic quip and every recognizable setup , miami rhapsody began to feel more and more forced and artificial , like some film school project to cram as many woody allen references as possible into 95 minutes . there are far worse models for making a film than woody allen , and frankel fires off so many jokes that several of them invariably hit . but while frankel is adept at writing one-liners for his characters , he doesn't really know how to place them in interesting or memorable situations . miami rhapsody is not without its moments , and i laughed more than a few times . if i * really * want to laugh , i'll watch the original .

1386,"something happens when innovative , independent directors "" go hollywood , "" and it's not usually a good something . some directors are ready-made for the pressures and compromises involved in working with big stars and big budgets ; others are so clearly out of their element that you can see them straining against the strictures of studio projects . sam raimi , director of the goofy and off-beat evil dead films , was hand-picked by sharon stone to helm the quick and the dead , and it looks like he had some interesting ideas about how to turn it inot a cock-eyed parody of spaghetti westerns . instead , it's not played with enough of a wink , and it becomes an extremely repetitive story muddled by tone shifts and unnecessary sub-plots . a few of the early gunfights are handled with typical raimi panache , including liberal use of the trackback/zoom in camera movement utilized by hitchcock and spielberg most notably . everywhere there are glimpses of raimi's twisted sense of humor , nowhere more so than in a gunfight which ends with the loser staring down at his shadow and noticing a hole in it . but that's all we get in the quick and the dead -- glimpses . where raimi wants self-awareness , screenwriter simon moore delivers a fairly standard western revenge saga . the story has potential , and particularly when a flashback reveals the source of ellen's grief there is evidence of some compelling psychological background . the relationship between cort and herod might have been exploited better , but for the most part cort is playing a part culled entirely from eastwood's penitent gunslingers in pale rider and unforgiven . and this is the real knock on the quick and the dead : without a real focus on raimi's satirical sensibilities and acrobatic camera tricks , it's just a less-than-mediocre knock-off of eastwood's oeuvre . gene hackman is a marvelous villain , oozing despicable charm , but his presence only magnifies the comparisons to unforgiven , and when he exposes a boastful gunman ( lance henriksen ) as a fraud , it sounds exactly like his debunking of english bob's self-aggrandizing tales in that earlier film . sharon stone is surprisingly effective as the haunted vengeance-seeker , but ultimately she too is lost in a story that doesn't really seem to have a sense of purpose . the quick and the dead boasts some fine cinematography by dante spinotti and a wonderfully dilapidated production design , and they could have been used in the service of a nice piece of parody . unfortunately , raimi couldn't or wouldn't let the throttle out , and the quick and the dead stalls when it's played far too straight .

1387,"screenplay : jimmy mcgovern . director : antonia bird . to tell you far more about myself than you ever really wanted to know , i am what is known in the parlance as a lapsed catholic . why would i make that information known ? it certainly wouldn't be to promote the perception of objectivity in my evaluation of priest ; one might believe that i was inclined to look favorably on a film so roundly condemned by the catholic church sight unseen . such is not the case . i explain that i am a lapsed catholic because the themes in priest are extremely familiar to me , and i believe that there is a story in those themes which would make a fine film . priest could have been a compelling character study which respected the complexity of modern catholicism , but instead it is , in its own way , just as dogmatic as it accuses the church of being . for much of the film , powerful acting and an intriguing character keep priest on the right track . it is the kind of selective observation of catholic dogma which is common among comtemporary catholics , and evidence of a skewed set of priorities . unfortunately , what begins as a measured examination of religious hypocrisies turns into a kind of tirade . not only does the film become pedantic at this point , it simply becomes dull , and crawls toward its emotional climax . the flawed but human characters whose conflicts seem real become little more than mouthpieces . perhaps it is most difficult to digest the message of priest because it makes so little effort to treat the opposing point of view with any respect . whether or not the catholic church is deserving of criticism is not even the point . this is an examination of doctrinal morality as oliver stone might have done it , too full of homilies and too lacking in an understanding that issues are usually shades of grey . there are probably father gregs and father matthews in many parishes around the world , and that is an issue deserving of attention .

1388,"you might not be surprised to find such a scene in a movie like the cure , but you probably would be surprised to find it only twenty minutes into the film . while it is exceptionally well-acted , the cure rambles on for far too long without a sense of purpose , like an attempt to stretch an "" afterschool special "" into a feature film . to the cure's credit , the most important thing about it , the relationship between erik and dexter , is also the best thing about it . brad renfro , who made an impressive debut in the client , has the more dynamic role of erik , the cocky inveterate liar . their rapport is genuine and very touching , and complemented by the fine supporting work of diana scarwid and annabella sciorra as their mothers . what sabotages the emotional impact of their friendship is the cure's clumsy and episodic story arc . there is nothing to do with them but send them off on a series of adventures , some of which are mildly interesting but don't really have a dramatic purpose . while erik and dexter are well-acted and sympathetic characters , at a certain point it becomes clear that all we are really going to be doing for the rest of the cure's running time is waiting for dexter to die . and what a wait it is . it seems as though screenwriter robert kuhn had an idea for a drama about aids and a drama about two friends on a journey , but neither one was long enough independently to turn into a feature . it's a shame , because director peter horton ( tv's "" thirtysomething "" ) has a deft touch with much of the film's potentially pathos-inducing material . but when you're playing the aids card , you had better have a really strong hand . the cure has one solid pair of aces , and a lot of spaces .

1389,"starring : hugh grant , colm meaney , tara fitzgerald , ian mcneice , kenneth griffith . screenplay/director : christopher monger . if it had not been for jim carrey , hugh grant might have been hailed as * the * breakout star of 1994 . the englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain might have faced a monumental marketing challenge , or at least a name change , if not for the advantage of being hugh grant's first post-weddings effort . unfortunately , it's no honeymoon . grant's fans could be massively disappointed , both by his relatively minor role and by the film's frequently tedious pace . the story , based on a tale from the family of welsh writer/ director christopher monger , begins as a promising enough fable about fish out of water and a legendary act of combined community will . monger does a nice job of establishing the scene , introducing the quirks of the characters in the matter-of-fact manner of an accomplished tale-teller who relates a story he knows to be fanciful with utmost earnestness . the clash of personalities between the merrily profane morgan "" the goat "" and the ever-apoplectic reverend jones is entertaining , thanks largely to a good-natured performance by colm meaney , and stephen endelman provides a bright and lilting score which keeps the tone light . sadly , although it is clear that monger has a great affection for this particular story , it isn't nearly as interesting as he seems to think it is , at least not for 100 minutes . the key problem is that as much as he tries to convey why this "" mountain "" is so important to the people of ffynnon garw , he never quite manages to do so . he toys both with the idea of welsh identity being tied to the mountains , and with the general sense of loss brought on by the first world war , but as hard as he tries to draw us into the imperative of the ffynnon garw mission , he can't make it matter as much to the audience . while the efforts of the townspeople to thward anson and garrad in their every attempt to leave are sometimes amusing , there is a lot of space between them , and the englishman slows down to become a sporadically whimsical bore . it also appears that the presence of hugh grant resulted in an ill-advised restructuring of the script . the story really should have been about the welsh townsfolk , not about the two englishman , and indeed hugh grant is little more than a peripheral figure for fully half of the film . grant really just walks through this part , relying on his crinkly smile and hesitating delivery and little else . if the story had to focus on one of the englishman , it should have been garrad , played with puffed-up impatience by ian mcneice . of course , mcneice is only an actor ; hugh grant is a movie star . the englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain has some charms , and an appealing sense of place . it is also a case of an hour's worth of story stretched an extra forty minutes , and of a big name star in an essentially supporting role who becomes a tail wagging the dog . "
1390,"screenplay : melvin van peebles . director : mario van peebles . i have often said that the first responsibility of a historically based film is not necessarily to be good history , but to be good drama . documented facts can sometimes make for a compelling story on their own , but usually a bit of creative license is not merely acceptable , it's required . so how can i say that out of one side of my mouth , while with the other i criticize panther for being a mediocre account of the rise of the black panther party ? because by painting the characters in a far too positive light , the filmmakers have robbed the characters of their humanity , and everything that might make them interesting . while there are a number of powerful images , panther is a one-note drama which misses the opportunity to include some internal conflict . mario van peebles is developing into a director with a real flair for powerful visuals , and panther is no exception . his use of documentary footage and different film stocks has a bit of oliver stone theatricality , but without the wretched excess . the early scenes of the panthers' emergence as a force have a tense energy . it is a vivid example of why the black panthers' message was so widely embraced , and why they became so powerful so quickly . what van peebles is unable to do is provide any real sense of who these men were , and the reason is one of intent . both screenwriter melvin and director mario are not particularly interested in creating characters , it seems ; they want to create idols . bobby seale is presented as a serene sort of philosopher- king , relegated to the background in favor of the more vocal huey newton . but even newton becomes little more than a figurehead , a mouthpiece for a message rather than a fully-realized man . there is a single scene of eldridge cleaver ( well-played by anthony griffith ) breaking ranks to take more forceful action , but with that exception the black panthers in panther come off as one collective consciousness . the absence of any real internal conflict makes panther become extremely derivative . the tenth or eleventh time , it has long since lost its sting . there are just too many scenes of sneering brutality which become interchangeable in a way i'm sure the van peebles' did not want . the addition of a government/mafia conspiracy to flood the black community with cheap drugs only emphasizes the fact that this is a story entirely about looking outward . the black panther story is an important part of an important time , but it could have had real power if panther had been more about the men behind the movement and less an exercise in hero worship . "
1391,"during one fifteen minute sequence in mission : impossible , i was reminded of what a masterful director of suspense brian depalma can be when he is on his game . as cruise attempts to download files and get out of the booby-trapped room safely , depalma creates the kind of suspense that most directors of action only dream about -- you're wondering not only _if_ cruise will be caught , but which alarm will go off first . the cia set piece is crisply edited , and set up and executed with skill and flair . for those fifteen minutes , depalma is a genius again , and mission : impossible is all you could ask a summer adventure-thriller to be . it's telling that you won't see depalma's name anywhere in the advertising campaign for mission : impossible -- he's obviously not considered much of a selling point -- but it's the kind of job that can put a guy back on the a-list . what a shame that with the exception of those furiously tense fifteen minutes , depalma seems to be spending most of his time on damage control . the film is full of cockeyed angles , extreme close-ups , flashbacks and slow-motion , as depalma tries to create the illusion that somewhere buried in all the busy detail of plot , something is actually at stake in mission : impossible . just to demonstrate that i understand the point of mission : impossible , i will observe that it is a premise , a property , a franchise , an identifiable name to be exploited . it is an espionage thriller which comes conveniently after goldeneye has demonstrated that there is still a market for espionage thrillers , and it is yet another escapist entertainment like twister which treats story and character as luxury items not afforded by budgets in the neighborhood of $70 million ( a very comfortable neighborhood ) . there are scenes throughout the film which suggest that we're supposed to find the relationships between people relevant in some way , and instead i found myself scratching my head and wondering where , precisely , i was supposed to have picked up that information . even depalma makes several puzzling choices during the film , including an ill-advised sequence which shows us through flashback that hunt knows someone is lying to him , making a scene which comes later thoroughly anti-climactic . still , he seems most of the time to be trying his best with a script by david koepp and robert towne ( and which featured story assistance from steven zaillian ) which is both simplistic in premise and ridiculously convoluted and confusing in the execution . there is one extremely well-handled and unexpected development quite early in the film , and it offers the hope that mission : impossible is going to avoid the predictability bug . however , at its heart mission : impossible is about one real question -- who is the real traitor -- and i found myself waiting for the inevitable revelation through a morass of ridiculous leaps of logic . mission : impossible's two other action set pieces will certainly have their fans , and there are moments of excitement and cleverness in both of them . but i found the opening sequence brutally edited , and if you've seen any trailers or commercials for the film ( and how could you miss them ) , you've seen the best moment in the big high-speed train finale . no , there is only one real reason to see mission : impossible , and that is those fifteen precious minutes when you are reminded that a scene without special effects can be gripping because it was put together by a superb craftsman , a director who can momentarily make you forget about a sloppy script , and make you care about the fate of cardboard cutouts . "
1392,"it is one of the more cumbersome pieces of baggage which goes along with being a film critic that , every once in a while , a film comes along which you are _supposed_ to like on general principle . critics are sometimes placed in the uncomfortable position of being expected to champion small , ennobling films simply because , like cinematic castor oil , they are good for us . we were colored is a film which wears its earnestness proudly on its sleeve ; it means well , and it tries hard . but a film has to have something more going for it than principle , and once upon a time . . . is a well-acted but extremely fragmented story which can't quite get its tone down straight . we were colored is not particularly interested in detailing the day-to-day ugliness of life in the segregated south ; it is a film about a kind of community which no longer exists , and as such it is occasionally quite touching . it is difficult not to watch scenes of 4th of july barbecues for which the whole town turns out , or to notice how the people of glen allan look out for each other , without feeling a sense of sadness that that unity had to disappear with the passing years . the main problem with once upon a time is that it makes frequent side trips to episodic stories which don't resonate , despite insistent voice-over narration ( provided by screenwriter paul w . cooper ) that tries to convince us that they should . the story allows for a scene in a backwater juke joint which adds a bit of atmosphere , but the relationship doesn't really matter , because there's a history there we haven't had a chance to see . there is an incompleteness to many of the individual episodes , and a lack of emotion to scenes which seem designed to provoke an emotional response . too often , however , the film drifts away from cliff's point-of-view , or injects an obligatory bit of racial violence almost because it seems to be expected . first-time feature director tim reid maintains a steady pace and evokes the atmosphere of his setting skillfully , but he doesn't find a narrative in the many stories he is trying to put on the screen . if its story and its characters had been as consistent as its good intentions , it might have been a great film .

1393,"starring : arnold schwarzenegger , james caan , vanessa williams , robert pastorelli . screenplay : tony puryear , walon green . director : charles russell . hardly anyone seems to be talking about it . in a movie season where marketing has attempted to turn every subsequent blockbuster into a pop culture happening , eraser seems to be just another supporting player ; it is even sharing its release date with disney's latest animated fiscal printing press the hunchback of notre dame . arnold seems to have managed the heretofore unthinkable feat of becoming unobtrusive . the result might be an absence of overly high expectations , which can only work in eraser's favor . it's generic schwarzeneggerian action fare which almost manages to seem quaint in its cartoonish basic-ness . eraser is pretty much everything you've come to expect from a schwarzenegger action vehicle : impossible odds , explosions , predictable and groan-inducing one-liners ( if you can't tell me what precedes the line "" they had to catch a train , "" please sign up for remedial arnie-isms ) , big cool guns , and big cool arnie firing them with abandon . director charles russell ( the mask ) leaps right into the action with scarcely a breath , and for the next 100 minutes seems blissfully concerned with little else . it is as though he were saying to the audience , "" i've given you a good guy and some bad guys -- you know how it's going to end , now enjoy the ride . "" and in spurts , it's actually possible to do so . in those scenes , eraser is pure mindless fun in the best sense of the term , but those scenes are also somewhat isolated . there is a surprising grimness to much of eraser , including two separate incidents where kruger takes an excruciatingly long time to remove a piece of shrapnel from his flesh , and schwarzenegger himself is overly somber in much of his performance , brooding over a dark past to which we are not made privy . these token attempts by russell and his screenplay-by-committee team to make schwarzenegger more vulnerable and human demonstrate a real misunderstanding of his appeal . audiences come to see schwarzenegger the super-hero , and to laugh along with his awareness of the absurd situations in his action films ; he is the master of the catch phrase because they are winking distillations of those absurdities . there are far too few opportunities to laugh in eraser , except those provided by robert pastorelli as the motor-mouthed wiseguy who becomes kruger's assistant . the irony of eraser is that it turns its greatest asset into a weakness . in a season filled with films which seem to be playing hyped-up games of "" can you top this ? "" with their visual effects and decibel levels , eraser provides an odd familiarity -- it's just li'l ol' arnie , playing hero and making the world safe for democracy . unfortunately , eraser just rests on its familiarity , providing a bland villain ( caan playing sonny corleone as a turn-coat g-man ) , a bland heroine ( vanessa williams running and serving up the occasional "" i-am-woman-watch-me-kick-a-little-ass "" bit of crowd-pleasing ) and a finale which is truly anti-climactic . eraser manages a few solidly entertaining moments , and serves up the kind of meat-and-potatoes action schwarzenegger's fans have come to expect . it also is a film which spends a lot of time shuffling its feet , and it will be interesting to see how audiences respond to a blockbuster which seems to be saying , "" don't mind me . "" "
1394,"there is a single word which is quite conspicuous in its complete absence from the production notes for the adventures of pinocchio : "" disney . "" there are references to "" the version most audiences find familiar , "" and comments about the "" watered-down "" adaptation , but nowhere does anyone acknowledge that disney's 1940 animated classic presents a rather tough act to follow , perhaps as though they are wishing upon a star to erase that legacy . naturally , the film-makers have chosen to push the fact that this version is more "" in the spirit "" of the 1883 children's tale by carlo collodi than previous film versions , but while the adventures of pinocchio might be closer to the source material than that "" version most audiences find familiar , "" i suspect it won't be closer to the hearts of many viewers . it is a moderately diverting entertainment for children with little to offer for adults . there are a number of new twists to this telling of "" pinocchio "" which are actually quite interesting , chief among them the portrayal of pinocchio himself . still there is that legacy , and the adventures of pinocchio finds itself in the most trouble when it brings to mind the way similar sequences were handled by disney . all of the most familiar moments are here -- pinocchio's triumphant performance at the puppet show ; his fib-enhanced growing nose ; the transformation of lampwick ( corey carrier ) into a jackass ; the escape from inside the whale -- but the changes in those scenes are generally cases of trying to make them bigger rather than better . the transformation scene is particularly noteworthy in this respect , placing pinocchio , lampwick and a pair of other boys on what appears to be the indiana jones adventure , rocketing through caverns at maximum speed and volume . barron seems to have no idea what to do with him except consistently have him magnified or placed in annoying perspective shots , and his comments generally consist of limp attempts at anachronistic humor . on the one hand , i want to give barron credit for trying to unify the episodes of "" pinocchio , "" for eliminating the deus ex machina fairy and for underscoring the relationship between pinocchio and geppetto which seems to be an afterthought in disney's version . unfortunately , he doesn't really get where he wants to go , and he is too interested in keeping the kids happy with slapstick and the ever-popular dog urination gag to pay attention to the story which might mean something to adults . the adventures of pinocchio has enough visual spark to please young audiences , and a noble enough message to appease their parents , but it lacks the wit , warmth and emotional highs to erase the memory it is trying so hard to erase . this pinocchio may become a real boy , but he's not the real thing .

1395,"screenplay : barry fanaro , mort nathan . have you ever had an 11-year-old try to tell you a joke ? if so , you will probably recognize a couple of typical qualities . first , the enthusiasm of the joke-teller far exceeds his mastery of the basic principles of comic timing ; second , the joke is almost certainly one you've heard before , and probably one you told when you were 11 . peter and bobby farrelly ( dumb and dumber ) are still those 11-year-olds at heart , and their sense of humor seems to have matured only marginally . if you laugh at their films , it is probably for the same reasons you might laugh at the 11-year-old's joke : their eagerness to amuse is endearing , or there's a bit of the 11-year-old in you as well . kingpin is often disgusting , but that is usually when it is at its funniest . it is also often slow , and that is when it is an effort to get through . kingpin is a film which tends toward the parody style of the zucker-abrahams-zucker ( airplane ! ) the operative word here is "" obvious . "" if obviousness were water , kingpin would be the pacific ocean , giving each gag plenty of lead-up time so you can anticipate the punch line and spend a moment groaning as it is underlined for you . when kingpin isn't obvious , it's sick . having covered diarrhea , mucus and urine in dumb and dumber , the farrellys move right along their bodily emissions hit parade to vomit and semen . and when kingpin isn't sick , it's repetitious . there are more individual injuries to male genitalia in this film than in an entire season of "" america's funniest home videos . "" the thing about kingpin is that even when it is obvious , sick and/or repetitious , it is still often very funny . i will be very frank about this : it is funny in about as base a way as it is possible to be funny , in a way that will be just plain unfunny to many people , or funny in a way that might make you embarrassed to admit you found it funny . it is funny in that adolescent way that can't help but snicker at gags about hardened nipples , farmers and sheep , or oral sex with a painfully unattractive woman . there are a few moments of inspiration in kingpin , particularly a hilarious turn by bill murray as roy's obnoxious rival which harkens back to his smirking glory days , but this really isn't a film meant to operate on an inspired level . it is the kind of leering , slobbering , juvenile comedy mel brooks is still trying to make , but appears to have forgotten how to make , and it sneaks past your sense of indignation , into the most primitive part of your backbrain , and gets you laughing . that said , kingpin still isn't particularly satisfying , mostly because it makes the mistake of trying to create an actual dramatic subtext . harrelson is left in the uncomfortable position of playing a grotesquerie one minute and an ostensibly sympathetic loser the next , and he isn't nimble enough to pull it off . kingpin really crawls during its final half hour as the farrellys play up the redemption story , proving once again that a scattershot comedy of this kind really has to pull in at around 90 minutes . then again , lack of timing is just one more way the farrellys are like 11-year-old joke-tellers . if you are over 21 , kingpin will probably be an erratic ride at best . but if you are able to identify with the 11-year-old in you , hold on to your sides . "
1396,"alaska is about as basic as film-making gets , and that is not entirely a criticism . disney used to make a series of films called "" true life adventures , "" wilderness yarns chock full of great scenery , cute critters and just enough darwinian conflict not to be alarming to the little ones in the audience . those films were basic -- a vista , an animal , a fight , repeat -- but most of the time they were also effective . that is the vibe alaska is looking for , and might actually have matched if it hadn't had so many darned humans . there is some lively adventure in alaska , but when most of the real fun comes on four legs , it is difficult not to lose patience with the two-legged cast members . i won't waste too much time on the trite and silly elements of alaska , because fortunately scripters andy burg and scott myers do us the same favor . it even has the best bad actor in screen history as its villain ( who , coincidentally enough , happens to be the director's father ) . and yes , it does perplex me how sean made it through three days of rock climbing , wading in icy rivers and plodding through the frozen tundra in his adidas high-tops . no , the problem with alaska isn't that the people are one-dimensional characters or mediocre actors . even after coke has turned computer-generated frolicking polar bears into a corporate logo , the real thing is still adorable ; i dare anyone not to smile ad a cuddly cub doing a belly slide down a snowy embankment . that bear is sympathetic and entertaining in a way his human co-stars can never hope to be , and he is the real star of alaska . he just doesn't have any supporting players . that points up a significant drawback in a film which is supposed to be a wilderness adventure , namely that there is not enough wilderness , especially in the first half . there is plenty of photography of majestic locations ( of a strangely flat variety by cinematographer tony westman ) , but fraser c . heston doesn't quite know what to do with it . it is fine for a family adventure like alaska to turn in only a rudimentary plot provided it delivers the thrills , and they finally start coming with about half an hour left . that last half hour is very exciting , though , with a white water sequence as impressive as anything in the river wild and a literal cliff-hanger of a climax . by then , over 70 minutes into alaska , young viewers could be getting might restless . _that's_ a story i really would have enjoyed , and i couldn't help wondering why alaska hadn't tripled its polar bear content much earlier .

1397,"screenplay : edward burns . director : edward burns . there are sound historical reasons for such concern ( think of lee tamahori's mulholland falls or antonia bird's mad love , if you are one of the few people who actually saw them ) , but in the case of edward burns , such concern would seem to be misplaced . for an independent feature , the brothers mcmullen was about as mainstream as they come , a low-key charmer unlikely to offend anyone who wasn't a devout catholic with a short fuse . with a budget about 120 times greater than mcmullen , burns has made she's the one , a film just as unlikely to offend . . . and , unfortunately , equally unlikely to entertain . if there was any real criticism leveled at the brothers mcmullen , it was that it was simply a testosterone-enhanced version of a female bonding film , in which the female characters existed primarily to give the men something to complain about while sharing a beer . at times , she's the one feels like burns' sheepish apology for that aspect of mcmullen , a piece of sensitive self-flagellation . "" look how we men make everything in our lives -- our jobs , our hobbies , our fantasies -- more important than our wives , "" he says sub-textually . "" don't we deserve whatever we get ? "" it's a nice gesture , this throwing open of the doors to the boys only club , but burns doesn't support it with characters who ring true , male or female . burns himself has a pleasant , likeable quality , but we are never given any insight into why he would be impetuous enough to marry a near-complete stranger . his dramatic range appears limited to mild annoyance and affability , and burns the actor can't bring to the screen whatever hidden passions burns the writer might have put on paper . let me make this point as subtly as i can : bahns did not get this part because she had a particularly good audition ; she reads a line as though she were going through the script underlining it with her finger . much of the pre-release interest , however , will be focused on the other two main cast members . cameron diaz , the latest next big thing as of 7 : 00 p . m . pdt , provides the same punch of smart sexuality she brought to the mask , and works wonders with a part which could have been a sneering bitch in other hands . her part is actually relatively small , but she gets some of the best and most poignant scenes . while burns seems unwilling to break her of the habit of saying "" okay "" before nearly every line , her work is still quite solid . it's all very casual and under-stated , but it feels like an extended sit-com -- no character too deep , no problem too complicated . i guess you could say that edward burns has indeed "" gone hollywood , "" in the most unfortunate sense of the term . "
1398,"director : arlene sanford . seventy-nine weeks -- count them , seventy-nine -- is all that separates the release of a very brady sequel from the brady bunch movie , in what has to rank as one of the fastest sequel turnarounds in film history . even taking into account the fact that the brady house sets and alice's uniform were already available , that's a tidy 18 months for writing the script , pre-production , shooting and post-production . you might expect a rather perfunctory piece of film-making given those circumstances , and you would find it . a very brady sequel has some cute moments , but it is lacking the sense of direction which made the brady bunch movie such a guilty pleasure . but all of them should be more concerned about roy , who primarily seems concerned about the whereabouts of a horse statue which could be worth a fortune . the brady bunch movie arrived in the middle of a slew of t . v . -to-film re-treads , so it was easy to overlook the fact that there was actually a point to it besides gratuitous nostalgia . even as the film made referrence to "" classic "" brady plots , it also provided the wonderful conceit of sealing the bradys in a bubble of obliviousness while time had marched on for everyone else , and it made for a genuinely entertaining remembrance of a simpler time with simpler problems . a very brady sequel misses the boat on both counts . there isn't nearly enough juxtaposition between the bradys and the modern world ; most of the film seems to take place in the brady house , with only a sarcastic matheson to react . as for the echoes of the original series , the most memorable were already used in the first film . we do get a detailed re-creation of jan's imaginary boyfriend george glass , and token references to other episodes like the hawaiian vacation shows ( don't be fooled by ads which make it look like the entire film is set in hawaii ; the bradys don't hit the islands until about twenty minutes remain ) , but a very brady sequel doesn't provide the same warmth of familiarity . there are a few solid laughs in that sub-plot , but unfortunately it underlines an over-reliance on sexual double-entendre of a staggering obviousness . i suppose a limited time frame to work on a script can make you leap for the easy gag . still , a very brady sequel does have the same superb cast to draw on , and they make for a film which seems more creative than it actually is . jennifer elise cox again has the showcase role of neglected middle child jan , and dumping her psychotic "" inner voice "" makes her desperation for attention a bit more fun . gary cole is also priceless -- it's hard to imagine a more convincingly earnest square , or someone else delivering a line like , "" so what are your plans now that you're alive ? "" as though it almost made sense . a very brady sequel is occasionally cute , directed competently by arlene sanford , but it's rarely clever . someone had an idea in mind when they made the first film , and that's true of the sequel as well . it's just that the idea this time was closer to , "" let's get this thing out there while the kids still look like kids .

1399,"screenplay : joe gayton , lewis colick . director : ernest dickerson . all right , let's dispense with the preliminaries first : yes , bulletproof recycles material which has been done before -- and done better -- in midnight run and 48 hrs . , among others . yes , it is the kind of movie which has been a thorn in the paw of everyone who has dreamed of a day when hollywood values an original idea . and yes , it includes the kind of sexist and homophobic bits which have been all too characteristic of films of its kind , targeted at the whooping goons of the movie-going world like the one sitting next to me at this film . all these things are true , yet they are not exactly the reason why bulletproof comes up short . you see , bulletproof is frequently quite funny , and it irritated me that i was unable to enjoy the laughs as much as i should have . it is somewhat ironic that archie frequently chides jack for seeing the world as "" just black and white , "" since that is just one of many ways this film follows the pattern of 90% of "" antagonistic buddy cop "" movies . just as a little test to check if you've ever seen a movie in this genre before , see if you can guess whether archie and jack are friends when bulletproof ends . that's right , this film takes you where every film of its kind has taken you before , on a bickering ride to an inevitable conclusion , and it is abundantly clear that writers joe gayton and lewis colick are aware of that fact as well . at only 85 minutes , bulletproof still feels long , because there is nothing of any consequence happening , nothing to build momentum towards a resolution . there is a recipe for a film of this kind , and gayton and lewis follow it , and we are simply watching them follow it . the experience is like watching an hour and a half long cooking show in which the final result is a bowl of cereal . i wish it had been easier to dismiss bulletproof given all those problems , but the fact is that it is also quite often funny . adam sandler , who turns in his least annoying screen performance to date ( and if that isn't damning with faint praise , i don't know what is ) , gets most of the prime lines , taunting jack and wise-cracking about the porno films on the motel television where the two spend the night . when sandler isn't trying to play a goofy character , he can deliver a line with a casual zing , and when he isn't screaming he can be funny . of course , it might also be true that screaming is just sandler's way of keeping a straight face ; if you've ever seen sandler perform live , you know that he finds himself hilarious , and when he is trying to "" act "" in bulletproof it always seems that he is trying not to snicker . damon wayans isn't much better as a thespian , and he is placed in the uncomfortable role of straight man . he does get a few brutal put-downs , but most of the time he is simply playing put-upon , and it doesn't suit him . when he and sandler are allowed to go toe-to-toe , the confrontations are enjoyable , but they are interrupted regularly by tedious and obligatory action sequences . the result is a strange inversion of the formula which made twister so frustrating : i wanted to be around for the scenes when wayans and sandler were trading jibes , but i was ready to head to the lobby as soon as the gunfire started . it is clear that both wayans and sandler -- and the audience -- would have enjoyed 90 minutes of their stand-up routines more than this routine of a somewhat different kind . for all its humor , the real joke in bulletproof is on anyone who expected it to be more than this month's variation on a theme .

1400,"what is it exactly about jean-claude van damme that is so appealing to hong kong directors ? his refusal to let plot interfere in a stunt ? and what else do the two films have in common ? uninspired situations and action which is unlikely to make anyone forget the director's hong kong efforts . i find myself at something of a loss as i try to come up with something worth saying about maximum risk , because it is such a resolutely mediocre film . it even wastes the presence of natasha henstridge , who may not have proven herself to be a gifted thespian yet but still has nearly as much impressive physicality at her disposal as van damme , and the only use to which it is put is in a nude scene which may re-define gratuitous . the one possible interesting twist -- alain is a military-trained crack shot -- is mysteriously kept under wraps until only ten minutes remain in the film , when suddenly he can shoot an eye out at 200 yards . van damme himself is making gradual strides as an actor , something genre cohorts like steven seagal may never do . the problem is that , through his own decisions or those imposed on him by the hollywood hierarchy , van damme performs in the kind of films where serious acting usually looks just plain silly . alain may be deeply affected by learning of the existence of his twin , but when he is forced to react to that knowledge by throwing yet another roundhouse kick or , worse yet , staring into a metaphorically convenient fractured mirror , it is like van damme is playing at acting rather than really acting . it has a dirty feel which is atypical of glossy hollywood adventures , and a few action sequences have real crackle , particularly the opening chase through the streets of nice . lam clearly has the chops to put the action in an action film , a knack for pacing and an awareness of where a camera should go .

1401,"director : al pacino . director of photography : robert leacock . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence ) running time : 110 minutes . part english lecture , part behind-the-scenes documentary and part theater piece , looking for richard is an ambitious experiment created by al pacino as a sort of "" everything you always wanted to know about shakespeare but were afraid to ask . "" motivated by a desire to make the works of william shakespeare speak to a contemporary audience , pacino spent several years ( evidenced by his now-you-see-it , now-you-don't facial hair in the film ) putting together a film version of "" richard iii "" which would combine performance of key scenes , observation of the actors wrangling over interpretation of those scenes , and historical background for the play . as an educational tool , looking for richard isn't exactly pitched at those individuals represented in his person-on-the-street interviews , most of whom greet the word "" shakespeare "" with a shrug or a grimace ( the notable exception being a panhandler who speaks eloquently about how the bard "" instructed us how to feel "" ) . it is a fairly academic piece of work , with lectures about iambic pentameter intermingled with talking heads describing the events in the play . pacino employs rat-a-tat editing to cut back and forth between locations for rehearsals , descriptive narration and the play itself , resulting in a film which may have been made with the multiplex audience in mind but which seems destined exclusively for the art houses . yet looking for richard is likely to bore those same art house viewers , because the film does not offer much in the way of insight . the actors and academics who speak throughout looking for richard go to such lengths to make the basic plot of "" richard iii "" understandable that they have little time or inclination to dig deeper . it is also likely that those same art house-attending , shakespeare-loving viewers saw ian mckellen's dynamic richard iii last year , a cinematic rendering which does far more to thrust the play into a 20th century context . pacino himself plays the hunch-backed villain with his typical intensity , and he often shifts into his habit of indicating the significance of a given line by the volume at which he delivers it . it is a straightforward performance , but far better ones are turned in by kevin spacey ( whose buckingham seems so fiercely intelligent that he becomes like an advisor to a modern politician ) and even alec baldwin ( a surprisingly sympathetic clarence ) . winona ryder is a bit less successful as lady anne , and aidan quinn is even less successful as richmond ; quinn in particular is like a walking manifestation of john gielgud's comment in the film that american actors become intimidated by shakespeare because "" they've been told they can't do it . "" if looking for richard does one thing particularly well , it is to emphasize the interpretive process which makes shakespeare a living text . there may be little inherent drama in a group of actors sitting around a table talking about what they see going on in any given scene , but the scenes of those conversations help to show the unique qualities of performed literature . it is one of the film's best moments when pacino's collaborator frederic kimball explodes in frustration at pacino's plan to ask an "" expert "" why a character might have acted in a certain way . "" you know more about this character , "" kimball bellows , and it is a perfectly succinct description of how a role is re-defined by every actor who performs it . that makes looking for richard an interesting supplement for a drama class , but it isn't nearly as worthwhile for an english class . with its snippets of scenes and specific historical asides , looking for richard doesn't exactly teach how to explore the bard's texts . it is more like a filmed version of the cliff's notes .

"" picasso himself is similarly enigmatic , played by anthony hopkins as an egomanical bon vivant , turning his fame into a method for making people feel insignificant , and honored merely to be in his presence . ivory and jhabvala do a fine job of showing us the effect of picasso's behavior on those around him , but they are much less effective at showing us the man himself . we are never allowed inside the passionate artist ; hopkins is technically proficient , wandering accent notwithstanding , but his is a role which seems designed to be observed rather than understood . you can always count on a merchant ivory film to look splendid , and there is superb work once again from cinematographer tony pierce-roberts and production designer lucianna arrighi . it is a beautiful environment they have created for this story , but the characters in that environment are disappointing . there are several moments in surviving picasso which inspire a curiosity about this fascinating man , notably his rivalry with contemporary henri matisse ( joss ackland ) , but there is always the nagging sense , as there was in jefferson in paris , that ivory doesn't really have a point of view . his biographies are safe , almost documentary detailings of events in an individual's life which do not add up to a story . picasso and jefferson were both fascinating historical figures with private and public lives full of contradictions , and they should have made for great drama . ivory simply seems too respectful of his subjects , content to lay out events like they might appear in a history text without much in the way of interpretation . the irony is that he has been able to take far more internalized fictional characters , like the remains of the day's james stevens , and make them extraordinarily vivid .

1404,"screenplay : leslie bohem . director : rob cohen . running time : 115 minutes . it is one of the more trustworthy rules of popular culture that everything old must eventually become new again , and 1996 at the movies sure has looked a lot like the mid-70s . twister and independence day were less like contemporary action films than the were heirs to the disaster epics of twenty years ago , with plucky bands of one-dimensional characters trying to withstand barrages of special effects . with two volcano films and james cameron's titanic on the horizon , it is beginning to feel like irwin allen has taken over hollywood again , and that thought doesn't inspire much nostalgia . daylight is a poseidon adventure clone with a few effectively tense moments , but it is so plodding and mechanical that it is rarely entertaining . that leaves him in danger as well , though the greatest danger isn't entirely clear . daylight begins with a couple of red-herring criminal activities which end up causing the firestorm in the tunnel , but it is indicative of the shortcomings of the script that the bad guys then become cinders rather than sticking around to make any more sparks fly . there simply isn't enough to any of the characters to give the conflict energy ; everything we know about each of them comes from a series of postage-stamp sized establishing scenes , and that's not nearly enough . with the vague bureaucratic malevolence aboveground and the muted mutineering below ground as the only antagonism in most of daylight , the absence of a real villain becomes a distinct drawback , and results in a plot which grinds from impossible situation to yet-more-impossible situation . that is not to say that there is no drama in daylight , though little of it comes from the silly dialogue or thin characterizations . surprisingly , it also doesn't come from the special effects by industrial light and magic , which often have a strangely low-budget quality . repeatedly , characters are forced to decide who can be saved , or whether someone is worth saving , and director rob cohen ( dragonheart ) somehow makes those moments matter even though individual characters don't . that alone might be more than you would expect from a sylvester stallone action film , although sly himself merely seems to be going through the motions . screenwriter leslie bohem has handed him a character which even seems to be a barely re-worked version of his tragedy-scarred , redemption-hungry role in cliffhanger , and he wanders grimly through most of the film without showing us any hint of a personality . he also has to carry daylight on his broad shoulders , because this is one disaster film which doesn't blow its budget on putting an all-star cast in harm's way ; amy brenneman and viggo mortensen are no faye dunaway and fred astaire . however , daylight does try to follow up on one bit of disaster film trivia -- both the poseidon adventure and the towering inferno won best original song academy awards -- by serving up a sappy romantic ballad called "" whenever there is love . "" the female half of the duet ? donna summer . yes indeed , folks , it sure does feel like the mid-70s all over again . "

( the aliens' downfall certainly does not involve a computer virus ) , but the ideas prickle rather than tickle . something seemed to be annoying tim burton when he made mars attacks ! , and he's probably going to be more annoyed if audiences decide it isn't the movie independence day was .

1410,"director : jane campion . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( brief nudity , adult themes ) running time : 145 minutes . directors , both cinematic and theatrical , face their greatest challenges when dealing with "" classic "" material , and not just because audience familiarity with the text makes every step a potentially treacherous one . no , the real temptation is to go too far in an attempt to make the material -- pronounce the following word dripping with sarcasm -- "" relevant . "" never mind that the text most likely achieved its lofty status because its themes transcend the socio-political flavor of the month ; the director is determined to give it a contemporary spin . the irony of jane campion's adaptation of henry james' the portrait of a lady is that campion treats the narrative , a narrative with an intrinsic emotional force , with meticulous faithfulness , while her heavy hand as a director inspires plenty of head-shaking . campion opens the portrait of a lady with voice-overs of modern women discussing their thoughts on romantic love , followed by a credits sequence featuring black-and-white images of women ( we assume the same ones we just heard ) just hanging out together in nature . campion certainly sympathizes with female characters who seem trapped by societal proscriptions ( like the heroines of an angel at my table and the piano ) , but nearly every interpretation of isabel feels misguided and simplistic . the central question of why isabel marries osmond is addressed with a pair of fantasy sequences which make the jarring suggestion that her tragic decision was the product of good old-fashioned lust . that notion might have been easier to stomach if osmond had been played by anyone other than john malkovich . malkovich has turned the aloof lothario into his stock character , but the portrayal has become more chilly than chilling . it is a perfectly valid interpretation to suggest that isabel had no choice ; it may also be the least interesting one . after hammering away at us with the restrictive nature of isabel's 19th century world for two and a half hours ( and at times you can feel every minute of it ) , it feels like a cheat for her to rehash the same point when addressing the most compelling enigma the novel has to offer . it is all the more frustrating because there are so many other things the portrait of a lady does right . with the exception of malkovich , the casting is superb , including nicole kidman as the wide-eyed innocent abroad with the eraserhead hairdo . barbara hershey and screenwriter laura jones to a particularly fine job with madame merle , a complex creature of uncertain motivations . de merteuil to malkovich's recycled valmont . martin donovan is also quite good as the consumptive , kind-hearted ralph , and mary-louise parker has a delightful bluntness as isabel's american friend henrietta . the production offers a variety of pleasures , notably stuart dryburgh's impressive photography , but campion flattens the most involving stories in the portrait of a lady . james' clash of american and european sensibilities becomes campion's clash of 19th century and 20th century sensibilities . the result is essentially a cautionary tale which only matters if you plan on doing any time travel , or a film treatment of a hypothetical prequel : "" smart women who make foolish choices : the early years .

1411,"screenplay : john cleese and iain johnstone . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( strong language , adult themes ) running time : 95 mintues . in case you were unclear on this point , fierce creatures is _not_ technically a sequel to a fish called wanda . . . though for the life of me i can't figure out why that was the case . it isn't as though john cleese had a radically different idea in mind for reuniting the four principal cast members . a great deal of effort went into reminding you why you might have enjoyed a fish called wanda , and then fierce creatures only delivers halfway . though buoyed by a couple of wildly farcical set pieces , fierce creatures often feels like a film in search of an identity . i don't blame the makers of fierce creatures for making its main characters so similar to those in wanda , because they were simply following a time-honored tradition for recurring comic teams . from abbott and costello through spade and farley , it has been understood that it is important for roles to be defined . id is id and ego is ego and never the twain should meet ; what would the audience make of it if curly suddenly began to browbeat moe ? the problem with fierce creatures isn't that its characters are familiar , it is that they are just familiar enough to be disappointing . cleese does the put-upon bit , but he's not put-upon _enough_ ; kline does the dense bit , but he's not dense _enough_ . the foursome found a dynamic in a fish called wanda which worked to perfection , and there are at least a few references in fierce creatures intended to capitalize on that goodwill . the script simply leaves you waiting on several occasions , waiting for it to take an extra comedic step which doesn't come . wanda also featured the delightful sub-text of the clash between british and american cultures , and fierce creatures chooses corporate avarice and gross commercialism as its satirical targets . yet there too the script by cleese and iain johnstone is disappointingly half-hearted with its jabs . the ruthless tycoon played by kline is clearly modeled after ruppert murdoch , yet he escapes with no more interesting a character trait than occasional flatulence ; the outrageous possibilities of a zoo with a ton of corporate sponsors yield some amusing results ( particularly the zoo uniforms covered in more labels than a stock car ) , but there is no major payoff . it is surprising primarily because cleese did a funnier and more concise job of skewering advertising in the schwepps spot which accompanied the american video release of wanda , a spot recalled by an advertisement cleese wears on the back of his suit coat in creatures . there are a pair of winning scenes in the classic farce tradition of slamming doors and near misses , one in a hotel room and the other involving the younger mccain's attempt to impersonate his father , yet that latter scene also reminds you of what is missing in much of the humor in fierce creatures . until the finale of fierce creatures , which includes a startling bit of black humor , the film feels terribly tame . the animals in this film aren't subjected to cruel fates ; they are photographed in all their quirky cuteness for "" awww "" moments and used for sometimes amusing slapstick comedy . too many things about fierce creatures feel just slightly askew , like the conflicted results of film-makers trying both to remind you of something and to make something completely different . at times , his work sparks memories not just of wanda's outrageousness , but of classic monty python as well ; at other times , he seems to have softened with age . he is just one of several creatures in fierce creatures which isn't quite fierce enough .

1412,"like most television performers venturing into feature films , fran drescher chose a first starring vehicle which would be comfortable in its familiarity . not much of a stretch , it would seem , until you take into account the fact that drescher isn't just playing a nanny in this case -- she's stepping into the shoes of the quintessential representation of screen nanny-dom , julie andrews . you see , the beautician and the beast may be part variation on "" beauty and the beast "" and part variation on the old "" fish-out-of-water "" comedy , but at its core it is something else . the beautician and the beast is really the sound of music remade , with a nasal new yawka instead of a novitiate . that may not sound terribly appealing , and indeed the extent to which you will enjoy the beautician and the beast may depend on how much of drescher you can take in one sitting . the beautician and the beast is a slight , meandering little film which is hard to get a handle on . todd graff's script goes most of the expected places , creating conflict between the controlling boris and the uncontrollable joy and providing stock characters like a good advisor ( ian mcneice ) to take joy's side and a bad advisor ( patrick malahide ) to make the soon-to-be-reformed boris look better by comparison . he also tosses in obscure references ( how many audience members are going to remember norma rae ? ) and scatters his multiple sub-plots all over the pace to be picked up whenever time permits . the plot drifts from joy's street-wise counsel to each of boris's children to preparations for the arrival of potential foreign investors , never really lingering anywhere long enough for the events to be of anything but casual interest . director ken kwapis doesn't develop any kind of comic rhythm in beautician , allowing many of the thin gags to stand alone . i suppose one alternative to creating a structure is swiping one , hence the extended riff on the sound of music . the similarities could almost be represented by one of those tables with the two films as the headings . i would not have been surprised to hear timothy dalton break into a chorus of "" edelweiss "" at least the beautician and the beast ends where the sound of music should have ended , with the kiss before all the political upheaval . the romance in the film is actually fairly appealing , thanks largely to the entertaining work of timothy dalton . he has a gruff , goofy charm as the stalin-esque dictator who grows warm and cuddly , giving spark to boris' sudden desire to become a populist even if it doesn't make much sense . he also shares a nice chemistry with drescher whenever she tones down the attitude for a quieter moment , but quiet is a relative consideration where drescher is concerned . there is also no question that it can be distracting , even if it is her calling card and gives her an edge many female comics could use more of . if you can get past the drescher drone , you might be able to ride along on the feather-light romantic comedy of the beautician and the beast . when the sound of the leading lady is hardly the sound of music , however , that kind of enjoyment may not be as simple as do-re-mi .

1413,"just so our points of reference are clear , the original that darn cat was hardly a classic . the folks at disney have been using that word as though they have a trademark on it , tossing it at everything it has ever committed to celluloid and becoming their own worst enemies as these "" classics "" are remade as gaudy nonsense like 101 dalmatians . 1965's that darn cat , however , was simply a cute little caper featuring disney's two principal live-action studio players of the 1960s , dean jones and hayley mills , and hardly a sacred treasure . the second life of that darn cat is very different from the first , but it's hard to say whether it is an improvement . it is a strange sort of family film : clever and amusing in some surprising ways , but disappointing at delivering the goods to keep the kids entertained . the script for that darn cat is attributed to "" s . you can certainly see those bloodlines in the eccentric characters who populate the film , and who give edgefield its edge . and we haven't even mentioned doug e . doug's twitchy turn as the f . b . i . agent , whose facial tics grow a bit aggravating but is simply hilarious when he goes into full prowl mode in his attempt to "" think like a cat . "" that's quite a switch from the 1965 version , where the cat had infinitely more personality than any human in the film . i'm also not sure that was a wise decision . the cat in the new that darn cat actually plays a fairly miniscule role in the proceedings , and while that leaves plenty of goofy goings-on which might entertain adults , kids may be somewhat disappointed by the film . director bob spiers ( british television's "" absolutely fabulous "" and "" fawlty towers "" ) maintains a fairly languid pace for much of that darn cat's running time , focusing on quirky character vignettes rather than funny feline frolicking . in fact , there's no particular reason for a cat to have anything to do with this plot ; it would have been just as easy for patti to find the watch herself and gradually discover the dark side of edgefield . spiers does pull out some strange and original physical comedy , like agent kelso's unexplained ability to do a gravity-defying backflip over a fence or his enthusiastic dive into a garbage bin , but most of the humor comes from silly behavior which might leave the little ones restless or unimpressed . spiers suddenly seems to become aware of the relative absence of broad , fast-paced slapstick in the final twenty minutes , which consist almost entirely of an extended car chase between patti and kelso and the kidnapers . after 70 minutes with scarcely a bit of john hughes-ian bodily injury humor to be found , that darn cat turns into "" the dukes of hazard , "" with cars flying through the air , glass shattering and gas stations exploding into a fireworks display . that darn cat makes some unfortunate choices -- particularly turning the search for the kidnapers into a mystery which results in a predictable "" scooby-doo "" style unmasking -- but for a remake of a disney film from an era which thrived on formula , this darn cat is surprisingly unpredictable . if this were not the kind of film where most of the audience _wants_ predictability , that quality alone would be enough to recommend it . it pains me not to recommend that darn cat , a film which would be a welcome change of pace for any parent who has had to sit through hyperactive kiddie fare like 101 dalmatians or space jam . i only wish it had more energy , more for the children , more of that darn cat . it could have been one of the rare live action disney films to deserve the term "" classic .

1414,"personal problems and terrible choices in film projects -- dreadfully comedies like fletch lives , nothing but trouble and cops and robbersons -- have turned chase into a poster boy for unfulfilled career potential , and lately it seems that he is trying so hard to win back his audience's good will that it simply comes off as pathetic . his latest attempt to re-animate the corpse of his film career -- a return for a fourth draw from the successful vacation well -- probably seemed like a good idea at the time , and the film isn't a complete disaster . it's simply so lacking in attempts at humor that chase might have had a better chance at coming up with a winner playing a slot machine . after fourteen years and three previous films , the vacation series has been around long enough to be the target of some in-jokes , and a couple of the film's best gags are based on familiarity with 1983's national lampoon's vacation at the very least . early in the film , clark laments a lack of family time together by noting to the kids , "" i hardly recognize you any more ; "" after four different actors have played both audrey and rusty , it's not surprising . unfortunately , the series has also been around long enough for the audience to expect a certain level of outrageousness and wild sight gags a la series creator john hughes , and vegas vacation simply limps along for much of its 92 minutes . the truth is that many of the actual jokes in vegas vacation are funny ; there are just stretches of minutes at a time when there isn't even an attempt at a joke to be found . the film gets particularly tedious when it follows the exploits of audrey and rusty ( played with a transcendental blandness by nichols and embry ) , but it's not much better trying to turn wayne newton into a comic actor . screenwriter elisa bell has set a film in one of the easiest cities in the country to make fun of , yet she seems unable to come up with anything funny to say about it . in fact , between the sluggish script and the extended sequences showing off the vegas sights and observing a siegfried and roy show , you'd think that vegas vacation had been commissioned by the nevada chamber of commerce . the biggest surprise in vegas vacation turns out to be that after over an hour of snooze-inducing nonsense , it comes up with one of the most purely inspired comic sequences of the last few years . i was nearly in tears laughing as a stone-faced croupier at the "" i'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10 "" table informed clark that 7 was incorrect , then almost immediately angry that a fraction of that imagination hadn't gone into the rest of the film . perhaps those five minutes can serve as a launching pad to better choices . but i wouldn't bet on it .

1415,"there is a scene about half way through blood and wine which , for the briefest of moments , inspires the giddy sense that you may be seeing something quite different . seconds later , you realize you aren't ; within a few minutes , you realize you're watching a movie with an inordinate fondness for inflicting punishment on its characters , and nicholson just happened to be first in line . with all the consternation over violence in the movies , you could easily forget that the kind of violence you tend to see in movies is fairly distant and antiseptic : gunfights in which people fall over like kids on a playground , comic book hand-to-hand combat where the winner walks away with a split lip and a smudged forehead . blood and wine may be the most brutal film ever made in which a gun is never fired . add a slow death after a car accident and a scene of nicholson suturing his own eyebrow , and you have a thriller strictly for the strong of stomach . with all the unpleasantness blood and wine asks its viewers to tolerate , you'd think it would offer a more satisfying pay-off for all the time spent shifting in their seats . that certainly creates an appropriately dark tone , but there is scarcely a drop of wit to lighten the relentless gloom . after recent films like bound have found a way to make you giggle at the tough talk even as you are engrossed in the story , blood and wine comes off as something to be endured rather than enjoyed . it might have helped a bit if there had been a hero worth rooting for . he sneers defiant insults at stepfather alex and falls in lust at first sight with gabriela , all the while acting like a 14-year-old rather than a 24-year-old . his refusal to get a life of his own might have made sense if the script had really followed up on a whisper of oedipal sub-text between jason and suzanne ; instead , you just want him to stop pouting and find an apartment . the only genuinely interesting think in blood and wine -- and it is a very interesting thing -- is michael caine's performance as victor . caine gives victor the weight of a shakespearean villain , his rotting body a reflection of his rotted morality , but his actions always seem born of fear rather than spite . only caine keeps you watching when your better judgment recommends turning away from blood and wine , a film where you find yourself ducking to avoid the psychic shrapnel as characters inflict pain on each other as though it were their job .

1416,"producers : bernd eichinger and martin moskowicz . director : bille august . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , sexual situations ) running time : 119 minutes . before smilla's sense of snow , the last time director bille august gut hold of a mysterious , best-selling novel was 1994's the house of the spirits . if that thought doesn't send a shudder of dread through you at the prospects for smilla , you were probably fortunate enough to miss the house of the spirits . spirits was a disastrous combination of mis-guided casting and even more mis-guided story-telling , and it lost all sense of isabel allende's magical realism . peter hoeg's _froken smillas fornemmelse for sne_ ( miss smillas' feeling for snow ) presented a similarly challenging combination of atmosphere , character and plot , and august , but this time around he has been much more faithful to the source material . unfortunately , the result still isn't a particularly good film . as tense and evocative as smilla's sense of snow is during its first hour , it shares the fundamental flaw of the novel : a strange plot device which may leave you wondering if you've just seen "" the x-files "" movie . you'd never expect a film with the plot i just described based on the first scene in smilla's sense of snow . the moment is spectacular , but when the scene suddenly shifts to modern copenhagen and the film becomes a dark , moody mystery , you might wonder whether you've just had an out-of-genre experience . more to the point , you might fear that august has snapped his cap . actually , august is simply preparing the audience for the radical shift still to come , a shift which wasn't nearly as radical in hoeg's novel . for about three-quarters of its length , smilla's sense of snow is a fairly compelling character study anchored by a strong lead performance . julia ormond may be a bit young for hoeg's smilla , but she makes the character her own with an unapologetic toughness uncommon in female screen characters . screenwriter ann biderman has done a fine job of paring down the novel's often-cumbersome plot and its glut of conspirators , allowing the focus to stay squarely on smilla and her relationships . ormond's performance and august's direction capture hoeg's lyrical , haunting psychological drama , a style reminiscent of _the english patient_ author michael ondaatje . but then there's that third act , and there's nothing august , biderman or anyone else can do about smilla's sense of snow's unexpected metamorphosis from michael ondaatje to michael crichton except take it all the way overboard . the greenland-based climax includes some splendid landscapes by cinematographer jorgen persson , and the arctic vastness suggests the coming of a resolution with an internal dimension -- smilla coming to terms with her life , her land and her heritage . the finale is so utterly bizarre -- and so unsatisfying -- that it taints the entire two hour experience of smilla's sense of snow .

1417,"selena enjoyed a phenomenal popularity among mexican-americans , and seemed poised to cross over to mainstream english-language success as well . well , after two hours and ten minutes of selena , i'm still not quite sure . there are plenty of details about selena's life , but no _story_ of her life . without a compelling narrative direction , selena becomes a polished and respectful feature film version of an a&e "" biography . "" nava tries to cover a lot of ground in selena , and one of the film's primary flaws is that it seems more interested in relating events than in giving those events any shape . there are a dozen minor conflicts strewn throughout selena , many of which could have been used to define what this film is about . there are even confusing gaps in the story-telling ( who were those guys who trashed chris's hotel room , anyway ? which make selena feel even more unfocused . selena generally feels most on-track when it captures her performances . the concert footage is somewhat over-dramatized , but jennifer lopez gives a charismatic performance as selena , lip-synching to the real selena's recordings while smiling a thousand-watt smile and radiating a genuine affection for her fans . nava tries to give her calling more weight -- selena says at one point that she feels "" all the hopes and dreams "" of her fans -- but mostly she just seems to be a born performer with an approachable personality . lopez has some very nice moments , as does the generally reliable olmos . his intensity , and the sense of responsibility he instills in selena as a mexican-american celebrity , give selena its greatest sense of purpose . even then , however , it still feels compromised by its unwillingness to dig very deeply . more to the point of the film , nava tells selena's story as though she should be a hero simply because she was a successful chicana . there are worse reasons to lionize someone than for being a good role model , and it is certainly a tragedy that a young woman died too soon , but the story of selena's life just doesn't make for a very compelling dramatic film . selena didn't need to be filled with dirt ; it just needed a reason for being besides providing a pleasant but unremarkable memorial to a pleasant but unremarkable singer . the well-made and well-acted selena will almost certainly satisfy selena's fans . those of us who didn't understand why she was so beloved may have to wait for the unauthorized biography .

"" who doesn't sound like an immature nit-wit while doing it . the appearance is good for a gasp of recognition from long-time ranger watchers , but it also gives the characters a dose of personality they never had as heroes . kimberly and jason actually spend most of their screen time trying to break out of the cargo hold of divatox's ship , and those scenes are surprisingly well-crafted and tense . for an action film designed for children , turbo is actually rather restrained , with more emphasis on suspenseful escapes than special effects-laden free-for-alls . directors david winning and shuki levy are working with some pretty limp material , but they make the most of it . they also correct the fatal flaw of the first power rangers feature by dumping the computer-generated zords and making the final megazord-vs . -megademon battle what it always should be : a battle of two guys in big rubber suits . turbo is unquestionably more fun for kids than for adults , but it is put together with some care , and it's a step in the right direction . day the ever-evolving rangers might morph into a movie franchise worth watching .

1419,"director : pat o'connor . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , nudity ) running time : 108 minutes . voice-over narration is a common cinematic device , particularly in nostalgic period films , yet i can think of few narrated films in the last thirty years which wouldn't have been better without it . narration tends to be a crutch , an attempt by a film-maker to be more "" literary "" which instead suggests that he lacks the patience to reveal the characters' psychology without short-cuts . inventing the abbotts is a pleasant period drama for a while , until the episodic story grinds to a halt as the actors sit around waiting for the narrator to tell us how they feel . the opening half-hour of inventing the abbotts is by far its best , energized by the awkwardness and buzzing hormones of its teen-aged principal characters . it is jennifer connelly's funny , sexy and sly performance as eleanor which provides the real spark to the first act of abbotts , her every scene punctuated by a wicked smile , a glimpse of underwear ( her own ) or a grab of the crotch ( not her own ) . then , thirty minutes into the film , connelly is banished from the narrative , and the whole production goes into a stupor trying to figure out what its about . there are really two separate plot-lines in inventing the abbotts -- jacey's attempts to live vicariously through the abbotts and doug's off-and-on romance with pamela -- but once connelly is out of the picture , the episodic story is sluggish and rarely involving . the single predominant reason for that lack of involvement is the narration , provided by an uncredited michael keaton to underline the action whenever and wherever possible . it becomes ever more obtrusive as the film moves along , first providing merely background information but eventually announcing the motivations of every character . it is the narrator who tells us how jacey _really_ feels about alice , not billy crudup's performance ; it is the narrator who make sure we understand how wonderful mrs . holt is , not the interactions between the characters . and , as though aware that they are under no obligation to convey their emotions through anything as mundane as acting , the actors simply don't bother . joaquin phoenix and liv tyler -- who needs to learn a different emotional shade before she's too old to play "" the virgin "" -- make a perfectly nice couple , but neither delivers a personality . both are pleasant to look at , and they might as well be modeling for still photographs . given the way fox has marketed inventing the abbotts to focus on its "" hot young stars , "" it's not unreasonable to think of them as models in a story . it's not that they can't act ; they're simply not given much of a chance to do more than look as warm and inviting as the 1950s suburban middle-america director pat o'connor ( circle of friends ) creates . the audience isn't given much of a chance either , which ultimately may explain more of my dissatisfaction with inventing the abbotts . as artfully made and sensitively plotted as it might be , inventing the abbotts ends up insulting the audience with its over-reliance on narration . tv's "" the wonder years "" became a parody of itself when daniel stern piped up every forty seconds or so to clarify significant details which required absolutely no clarification , and that's the way inventing the abbotts feels after 108 minutes . when narration makes a film feel more lazy than literary , as happens in inventing the abbotts , it's time to shut up and follow the old writer's rule : show , don't tell .

1422,"the first five minutes of gray's anatomy are as squirm-inducing as any five minutes of film you'll see this year . in a series of black-and-white talking head interviews , people describe every possible horror which could befall the human eye , including close calls with super glue , aneurisms and inch-long shards of metal . though nothing is graphically depicted , the descriptions are detailed enough to give a surgeon chills . it's a sensational set-up for an examination of the fragility of vision ; if you've never worried about going blind before , you may be inspired to start . spalding gray had to worry about it , and for all i know it was very traumatic . that's certainly not the impression you get from gray's anatomy , however . gray is one of america's finest story-tellers , and some of the stories about native american sweat lodges and obsessive nutritionists are quite entertaining . but the story-telling is very detached ; gray's milieu is the ironic observation , not the soul-baring revelation . it's true that plenty of frightening things seem ridiculous with hindsight , but gray shows us all the ridiculousness with little of the fear . the whole ordeal seems more like an amusing inconvenience than an existential crisis . gray's anatomy feels even more detached because of the way director steven soderbergh has chosen to stage it . this is the third of gray's monologues to receive a film treatment , but it is the first to be filmed without a live audience . the advantage of that choice is that soderbergh is free to create a surreal mood with arresting visuals . the disadvantage is that gray seems adrift without an audience . he becomes a story-teller trying to be an actor , playing things too broadly in an attempt to generate the energy he can't draw from audience reaction . like fellow story-teller garrison keillor , gray's strength is a straightforward delivery which makes you laugh without _signaling_ you to laugh . gray's anatomy is like "" a prairie home companion "" turned into a performance art piece . they're just not a very good match for the creation of a film . soderbergh's direction creates an intensity of mood which gray's stoic demeanor can't sustain , and gray's ability to wow an audience while sitting in front of a microphone is undercut by soderbergh's visual theatrics . the absurdity of some of the stories in gray's anatomy is bound to generate some laughs , but while you're chuckling at the stories you may feel there's something missing , something the opening five minutes promises but doesn't deliver . in this case , the eyes just don't have it .

1424,"screenplay : rusty cundieff and darin scott . director : rusty cundieff . in 1993 , cundieff made his debut with a clever mock-documentary satire of the rap music scene called fear of a black hat . with sprung , it appears that cundieff has decided that he's not willing to wait until the next film to change genres -- he'll change genres right in the middle of a film . unfortunately , it's more of a collision than a fusion , with both halves getting dented in the process . for over half an hour , sprung bears a startling resemblance to another 1997 film about middle-class african-americans lookin' for a little somethin' : booty call . sprung may be a bit more focused thanks to a more condensed time frame , but the familiarity is inescapable . in some cases , like a hilarious moment based on facial expressions of pleasure , that familiarity is welcome . in others , like the depressingly predictable appearance of a mincing gay stereotype for a cheap laugh , it is entirely unwelcome . of course , booty call was out too recently for cundieff to be guilty of intentionally stealing booty . the same situation applies when sprung suddenly takes a radical shift in tone to resemble a different 1997 film about middle-class african-americans lookin' for a different kind of somethin' : love jones . as the relationship between montel and brandy turns into a combination of soft-focus montage and tasteful black-and-white photography , sprung becomes an attempt at a straight-up love story which generally falls flat . montel and brandy aren't exactly characters -- they're just nice people who exist primarily to give the colorful clyde an adina targets for their mischief . though cundieff doesn't abandon the broad comedy entirely , he cuts back radically enough that you realize the broad comedy was the best thing sprung had going for it . as a love story , it's pretty limp stuff . sprung also shows that cundieff still prefers not to stray far from the satirical ground of fear of a black hat and tales from the hood . when working with the boundaries of a specific genre's conventions , cundieff knows just where to step to get a laugh . sprung just isn't tightly structured enough to allow him to show his stuff . it also requires him to create three-dimensional characters for the first time , a task at which he doesn't seem particularly adept ; he's more comfortable with the ridiculous than with the sublime . there will be other opportunities for the young and talented cundieff to master the more subtle skills of film-making , however . after all , he still has to do a historical epic , a violent caper film and an intimate family drama .

1425,"screenplay : david koepp , based on the novel by michael crichton . director : steven spielberg . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , violence ) running time : 127 minutes . sure , the lizards in question were not entirely mechanical , but i got the point . it also turns out to be , more or less , more of the same . the lost world offers all the shallow characterization and pointless plotting of jurassic park without the sense of discovery . only in the hands of steven spielberg could that recipe add up to something moderately diverting instead of a compete disaster . in many ways , the lost world is actually an improvement over jurassic park , if for no other reason than that it is more honest . spielberg takes exactly two minutes to show us the first dinosaur in the lost world , clearly aware that there's no point in creating build-up any longer . he also takes a note from a clever line in david koepp's script given to malcolm : "" yeah , ooh ahh . . . that's always how it starts . jurassic park was almost obliged to provide the wide-eyed wonder of the completely new ; the lost world , appropriately , delivers a much higher ratio of "" running and screaming "" to "" ooh ahh . "" it also doesn't have laura dern as a dumber-than-triceratops-dung paleobotanist , giggling like a schoolgirl over malcolm's description of chaos theory , or ariana richards shrieking about unix systems . what the lost world _does_ have is a generous helping of scenes and characters which are awfully familiar . pete postlethwaite plays this year's version of the great white hunter while arliss howard plays this year's version of the corporate scum ; the gallimimus stampede of jp becomes lost world's parasauralophus stampede . even the sequence of attacks feels derivative : t . rex attacks a vehicle and tries to push it over a cliff , t . rex chases people , people trek toward a distant goal , velociraptors take their turn . jurassic park was more enjoyable than it should have been because we had never seen this stuff before . lost world is the same stuff , just in greater quantities . those greater quantities are probably going to satisfy movie-goers who like their action fast and furious , with minimal interruption for silly little things like character development . no one will argue that that the lost world is much more than a string of set pieces ; there is also little question that a few of those set pieces are directed with that indescribable spielberg something . when spielberg is "" on , "" the results can be dizzying , and he's "" on "" just often enough to give the lost world a few satisfying sparks . like us , he's been there and done that . i believe i have seen jurassic park four times since its initial release , and i have enjoyed it less each time . if i had seen the lost world for the first time in 1993 -- if the order of the two films had been reversed -- i suspect i would have found it positively thrilling . in 1997 , it's just like watching jurassic park for the fifth time , when it's hard to get worked up over a film which has little going for it besides big mechanical lizards .

1426,"appropriately enough , that's the way the van wanders along as a narrative . the previous installments in author roddy doyle's barrytown trilogy -- alan parker's 1991 the commitments and frears' own 1994 adaptation of the snapper -- each provided an anchoring element for doyle's humorous episodes and colorful characters . instead of the commitments' energetic musical numbers or the snapper's sweet father-daughter relationship , the van offers under-developed nods to the embarrassment of unemployment and nationalist pride in the irish world cup team . one or two at a time , it's amusing to take in such "" honey , you won't believe the day i had "" tales . over the course of an hour and a half , the anecdotes grow a bit wearying . the van is certainly the least effective of the three cinematic barrytown tales , yet it is still manages to provide some high-spirited entertainment . most of the credit goes to meany and o'kelly , a pair of appealing protagonists who lend a flustered enthusiasm to most of their scenes . the humor comes as much from reaction as it does from situation in the van , with meany able to sell small moments like his very logical reaction to a customer who comes up 10 pence short for his burger ( meany takes a 10-pence bite before handing over the food ) . when the van does pay off with a big laugh , it makes you realize that it might have been great fun to watch these same characters in a more consistent story . instead , we have a cinematic snack truck , offering a few tasty bites rather than a truly satisfying meal .

1427,"even by the standards of independent cinema , dream with the fishes is a tough film to categorize . at times , writer/director finn taylor's debut feature is edgy and tough-talking ; at other times , it's a surreal odyssey ; at still other times , it's a sensitive drama of male bonding . it's a genuinely bizarre experience , something akin to watching brian's song as it might be re-made by abel ferrara and gus van sant . genuinely bizarre film experiences are rare enough that dream with the fishes should have been commendable on that count alone . those introductory scenes between nick and terry are the best dream with the fishes has to offer , maintaining a sense of mystery and a dangerous tension between the characters . nick , the hustler ( a sharp , eye-catching performance by hunt ) , seems to be working some kind of long con ; terry , the miserable voyeur , could be unstable enough to be far more trouble than nick expects from a guy in a tie . then , of all the posible things he could do with the characters next , taylor does perhaps the least interesting : he turns them into mis-matched buddies . all sense of invention , the life-blood of independent film-making , dissolves into inevitable pathos . taylor could have taken the characters in dream with the fishes and sent them off on a hyper-violent crime spree , or had them sit around for ninety minutes comparing notes on generational angst . it's a pleasant surprise that he does neither , but his resolution to this story is neither particularly pleasant nor particularly surprising . if there's one way i never expected dream with the fishes to end , it was with a life-affirming scattering of ashes . it's the ending to a made-for-lifetime movie with a testosterone twist . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1428,"don't make the mistake of assuming that "" 187 "" is gritty , urban classroom drama in the mold of dangerous minds . but this story isn't about the amazing power of dedicated teachers to effect change in the face of socio-economic hardships and an oppressive tie-in soundtrack .

1429,"given a classic action-comedy premise , gibson makes what would seem to be a rational acting choice : he gives a classic action-comedy performance . for about half the film , gibson is an oddball delight . what a waste . by all evidence , no one besides gibson involved in conspiracy theory realized that it was an action-comedy . exit slick , simple plot , enter a muddle of dark experiments and indecipherable connections between characters who never even appear in the film . the latter choice is ill-advised bordering on inexcusable . like the professional that he is , gibson sobs dutifully through the scenes of jerry at the end of his tether , spewing forth exposition between squints and grimaces , but it's clear he'd much rather be goofy than grandiose . it's easy to laugh at jerry when gibson is playing him for laughs , because there's no sense that he's genuinely mentally ill ; he's just a man who thinks he knows something who becomes a man who knew too much . every bit of fun jerry provides suddenly becomes vaguely tainted . you start to feel as though you really should be feeling sorry for him instead of laughing at him . that fun is desperately missed through much of conspiracy theory , because it turns into a very long sit . as the conspiracies pile up and the chases become a blur over two hours and fifteen minutes , gibson's sharp line readings act like electrical paddles to the film's heart . after four previous films together , you'd think that gibson and donner could find themselves on the same page . no such luck . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1431,"that notion explains a lot about how the film incarnation of leave it to beaver ended up as it did . i don't remember ward as a well-intentioned but emotionally immature doofus . the central character of leave it to beaver isn't really theodore "" beaver "" cleaver ( newcomer cameron finley ) , or his older brother wally ( erik von detten ) , and certainly not june ( janine turner ) . he's too busy damaging the lad's self-esteem by creating unrealistic expectations and appearing judgmental . and it's too bad , because there's a silly , innocent quality to leave it to beaver which makes it better than you'd expect from yet another tv retread . the comedy comes from the kind of predictably broad slapstick common in most contemporary comedies for kids , but it's blessedly free of toilet gags and exaggerated mayhem . brian levant and lon diamond's script ( levant worked on the syndicated "" the new leave it to beaver "" series in the 80s ) is often surprisingly clever , and even more surprisingly clean . the performances are sit-com simple yet mostly appealing , particularly that of the agreeably adorable cameron finley . it's obvious that leave it to beaver isn't meant to court the nostalgia audience , unless it is through the inclusion of barbara billingsley ( the original june ) and ken osmond ( the original eddie haskell ) in cameos . those viewers might actually enjoy seeing the cleavers portrayed as a healthy and happy family , rather than just another dysfunction waiting to happen . this leave it to beaver is unabashedly 90s in a fairly depressing way : it takes paternal incompetence as a given . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1432,"that should have been the idea , anyway . the edge is a wilderness adventure which also wants to be a psychological drama , but forgets to develop a convincing conflict between the two leads . in fact , there are precious few screen minutes of any kind between charles and bob before the are stuck together . for the most part , antagonism between charles and bob is presented as a given . after all , there's a beautiful woman involved , envy of wealth , stressful situations . . . what's not to be antagonistic over ? for one thing , the situations aren't all that stressful , thanks to an inherent lack of tension in the characters . every trivial piece of information he has ever read has become part of his photographic memory , making him a walking encyclopedia of primitive anthropology , basic physics , first aid , forestry , engineering and alternative cures for side-aches . as you watch charles fashion a compass from a magnetized pin and a floating leaf , or construct a squirrel trap from bent twigs , or go fishing with a thread from his sweater and a watch fob , you get the distinct impression that you're watching a portrait of macgyver as an older man . there's no reason to be worried about whether charles will make it . and it's too bad that there isn't more drama to the characters in the edge , because in concept and execution it's often a thrilling adventure . director lee tamahori ( once were warriors ) crafts some fine action sequences , notably those involving the survivors' ongoing battle with a mythically persistent man-eating bear . as photographed by donald mcalpine , the edge is a satisfying experience both visually and viscerally . intellectually , it's an ambitious disappointment . stories set in the wild usually assume that returning to a state of nature is the only way a human can survive away from civilization , which makes it refreshing to find a story which assumes that reason is an even more effective survival tool . it's particularly surprising that the writer is mamet , who has been known to have his characters turn animalistic while sitting at a desk .

1434,"the first half of mike figgis' one night stand contains some of the most effective film-making moments to hit american screens this year , yet even at the outset it's obvious that figgis isn't working at his sharpest . it's a lazy narrative device which allows figgis five minutes of screen time to re-hash the press notes before allowing max to finish with a portentous "" we'll see what happens . "" what happens , at least for nearly an hour , is a marvelously detailed portrait of an isolated infidelity and what it means to a man's life . the scenes between max and karen are tantalizing , but they're also risky , since figgis is showing us an act of adultery without first providing much context to build sympathy for the characters . the two sex scenes in one night stand are probably the most disparate i've seen in a single film , and the most uniquely effective . in part , the casting of snipes in the lead role is responsible . snipes is a reliable performer , but he never seems entirely in touch with this character . to be fair , figgis has written the part as the most guilt-wracked , angst-filled and introspective soul this side of hamlet . there are a couple of solid moments between snipes and downey ( affecting and acerbic as the terminally ill charlie ) , but at a certain point , 45 minutes in anticipation of a life-changing revelation feels like about 30 minutes too many . the blame for that belongs entirely with figgis , who can't hold the level of interest built by the film's first half . at turns he opts either to tell too much ( in snipes' opening monologue ) or too little ( in most of the second hour ) . it's a story which hints and teases , then offers a resolution which asks for a tremendous leap of faith as to the compatibility of certain characters . what begins as honest and probing turns sluggish , predictable and coy . snipes as the melancholy dane isn't the stuff of which great drama is made . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1435,"director : jon amiel . mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , adult themes , mild violence ) running time : 92 minutes . at last we can answer the question that has plagued movie-goers for ages : what would the pink panther films have been like if bill murray had played inspector clouseau ? all right , perhaps "" plagued "" is too strong a word . in fact , it's likely that no one has ever asked the question , probably because the answer seemed obvious . clouseau was similarly convinced ; he was also thoroughly self-deluding . playing clouseau would require murray to play dumb with complete earnestness . could he really stop winking self-knowingly long enough for us to buy him as an idiot ? the answer , unfortunately , is not really . the man who knew too little is a de facto clouseau premise , casting murray as a schlub named wallace ritchie whose unreasonable dreams of acting prowess have been diverted into working at a blockbuster video in des moines , iowa . though the comedic mistaken-identity premise is sporting more than a few gray whiskers , it can still work with the right lead performer . murray is a wonderful comic actor , the kind who can turn a simple reaction take into a monster laugh , but he is at his best when asked to stand outside the action and comment on its absurdity . eventually , the premise begins to feel like an elaborate waste of murray's time . ironically , the man who knew too little is still at its funniest when it just lets murray be murray . his off-hand quips are frequently good for a chuckle , providing goofy running commentary on the overly elaborate silliness of secret agent capers . they're also entirely out of place for his character . murray is sharper than this concept , and he shows it by spending most of his time looking for gags in all the wrong places , fighting against the premise instead of trying to make it work . there are a few worth-while moments for the supporting cast , notably alfred molina as a russian agent who develops a grudging respect for his "" brilliant "" american adversary , which show signs of life in a generally under-whelming script . for the most part , the man who knew too little is a less-than-stellar episode of the bill murray show , sporadically amusing when it doesn't burden the top attraction with an over-stuffed plot -- german businessmen , british and russian secret agents , a hooker-with-a-heart-and-wardrobe-of-gold , exploding matryoshka dolls , and what the mcguffin was going on with those carefully tied letters everyone gets so worked up over ? -- ill-suited to his talents . it all adds up to more stuff for murray to smirk at , in a role where smirking should have been strictly prohibited . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1437,"terms of endearment was a crowd-pleasing tear-jerker buoyed by smart comedy and rich characterizations ; broadcast news brought a throwback romantic comedy sensibility to an upscale study of journalistic ethics with an unexpectedly down-beat conclusion . even the notorious little musical that wasn't i'll do anything demonstrated brooks' willingness to cut bait when he knew the audience had no interest in what he was offering . as good as it gets had the potential for a classic written all over it . for once , however , brooks doesn't have a grip on how best to handle his material . he takes 90 minutes of great material and drags it out over nearly two and a half hours . it didn't have to be like that . as good as it gets has a wonderful character at its center , a truly horrible human being named melvin udall ( nicholson ) . it's an admirable theme for a film , this notion of a man deciding to change himself when he realizes the effect those changes have on other people . the pre-conversion melvin is an outrageous delight , getting away with hateful rantings few other characters could without inspiring protests . his growth as a character saps him of all his bad-boy energy , leaving in its place a tricky romance with hunt which somehow works even with nicholson perpetually looking like he's straining at the end of a leash . that romance might have been even more effective if brooks had kept his attention fixed on how melvin and carol are so good and so bad for each other . yet there's always simon there in the background , a distracting tangent the lightweight kinnear can't invest with sufficient gravity . his story adds little but the adorably grungy verdell , a couple of showboating scenes for cuba gooding jr . as a fuming art dealer , and a lot of padding to an already over-long film . brooks is too adept with a witty line to turn out a tedious film , and nicholson and hunt too capable to fumble the well-rounded characterizations . as good as it gets simply turns out to be a rare case of brooks failing to ride what works for all it's worth . it's funny but fitful , because we know this isn't as good as a james l . brooks film gets . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1438,"screenplay : woody allen . director : woody allen . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , nudity , adult themes ) running time : 95 minutes . woody allen spends 95 minutes blurring the lines between life and art in deconstructing harry . throughout the film , we get a chance to see harry's autobiographical tales brought to life , with different actors playing the roles of various individuals in his life -- julia louis-dreyfuss as one-time lover judy davis , demi moore as second wife kirstie alley , and so on . it's a fairly successful conceit , one which allows allen to take off on some extremely funny flights of fancy . allen has plenty of fun with the narrative device , but that same device also points out one major casting problem in deconstructing harry : with all the surrogate role-playing going on , allen should have found someone else to play harry block . in part , it's because the levels of self-referentiality become wearying . more to the point , allen isn't deft enough as an actor -- or ego-less enough as a director -- to make harry truly repugnant . in order for us to take deconstructing harry seriously as allen's acknowledgement that art does not forgive all , harry needs to be more than a pathetic little nebbish . another actor might have given harry's misogynistic rantings and rationalizations genuine bite ; allen's desperate need to be accepted and understood bathes his every moment on screen in apologetic blandness . of course , it's just as easy to read deconstructing harry as allen's argument that art _does_ forgive all . and in some ways , the film is its own best argument , teasing the audience with goofy entertainment whenever it's not making half-hearted attempts to dig into harry's psyche . perhaps it does matter to some viewers whether or not allen is a horrible human being with a morally reprehensible personal life . me , i'll settle for being treated to a bunch of laughs once a year . deconstructing harry is as effective in its comedy as it is distracting in its self-absorption , blurring the line between life and art just enough to make you wish allen could blur it a bit more . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1439,"i've gotta admit , i have a real hard time taking adam sandler seriously as a romantic leading man . and apparently i'm not alone in that respect -- sandler himself seems to be having a real hard time taking himself seriously as a romantic leading man throughout the wedding singer . it's surprising and refreshing to watch a performer like sandler try to stretch himself after a string of roles which required him either to scream , destroy things or scream while destroying things . it's also a bit goofy . i was surprised not to find an out-take reel over the closing credits of the wedding singer , since it looked like dozens of takes must have ended with sandler in the middle of a massive giggle fit . it's a good thing that the pleasant but improbable romance doesn't have to carry the wedding singer . the real star of the show is the mid-80s milieu -- a soundtrack full of the era's one-hit wonders pop tunes , thread-perfect costuming by mona may ( clueless ) , knowing references to the eventual breakup of van halen and several famous couples . in fact , the wedding singer is one of the more consistently chuckle-filled comedies of the last several months . though never out-and-out hilarious or inspired , tim herlihy's script ( with uncredited assist from carrie fisher , among others ) gets solid mileage out of its kitschy atmosphere , lively cameos by steve buscemi , jon lovitz and billy idol ( as himself ) , and one priceless moment involving a string quartet's solemn rendition of journey's "" don't stop believin' . "" even drew barrymore acquits herself admirably in the uncommon role of the "" nice girl . "" still , there's something ever-so-slightly askew about adam sandler trying to get away with the hushed tones and puppy-dog eyes of a sensitive , relationship kinda guy . he may be an actor some day , but he's not there yet ; he's still primarily a happy-go-lucky anarchist with a talent for silly voices and even sillier songs . robby's performance scenes are certainly where sandler seems most comfortable , particularly as he tears into a diatribe against his ex or a lyrically amusing ode to growing old with julia . when he steps off the stage and into his best faux john cusack , it just looks like it's all he can do to keep a straight face . the wedding singer turns out to be an entertaining way to spend 90 minutes laughing at the past . in a different way , it may be just as funny watching sandler spend 90 minutes laughing at an alternative future . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1441,"screenplay : joel coen and ethan coen . director : joel coen . while the grinding predictability of most american films challenges a writer to generate one more coherent thought than the film itself , coen efforts like miller's crossing , barton fink and fargo burst from the screen like doctoral theses waiting to be written , sending cinema scribes scrambling gleefully for a thesaurus . the bizarre supporting characters pinwheeling through their films could be glossed as metaphorical proto-fascists or subversions of traditional genre types ; their apparently stream-of-conscious narratives could reveal clockwork structure . oh , what happy hours could be spent fine tuning analyses fit for literary journals as we hurtled towards our deadlines . i spent most of the car ride home from the big lebowski -- and a fair chunk of time afterward -- spelunking for themes , tropes and symbols . the time frame of gulf war-era 1991 was certainly meant to place the story squarely in the twilight of the reagan/bush go-go 1980s . mix in the "" big "" lebowski's feminist avant-garde artiste daughter maude ( julianne moore ) , ironic allusions to political correctness and a few swipes at the boot-straps rhetoric of the well-to-do , and clearly you have a satire of the ordinary joe ( or jeff ) unwittingly fighting to make the world safe for republicanism . right ? it was so much fun deconstructing the big lebowski after the fact that i started trying to convince myself i had had as much fun watching it . the reason it's not more fun , despite a blissful singularity of vision which always keeps you watching , is that the coens seem to take the same approach to making their films that we critics take to analyzing them . they're not stories as much as they are intellectual and aesthetic calistheics , films which make you work hard enough that you have to convince yourself you're getting something out of them . joel and ethan's encyclopedic knowledge of genre conventions and film expectations allow them to understand exactly when to yank the rug , but in the big lebowski they fall into the same trap which hampered the hudsucker proxy : they create so much distance from the characters that you're left with congratulating yourself because you got the joke . if you're willing to surrender yourself to the coens' characteristic oddball flourishes , you certainly won't walk away from the big lebowski disgusted . second-tier coen fare is still better than most of what's out there ; it's hard not to take some pleasure in a film which includes among its antagonists a trio of marmot-wielding nihilists , or clothes a meek bowling buddy named donny ( steve buscemi ) in a succession of bowling shirts bearing every possible name _but_ donny . it's just disappointing watching the coens retreat into layers of irony once you've seen what happens in a film like fargo when they're willing to humanize their phenomenal film-making talent . as undeniably amusing as many of the big leboswki's oddball flourishes are , the film is almost nothing _but_ oddball flourishes , wandering along with a theme or two in tow . bad news for those in search of accessible comedy ; good news , as always , for those who work at finding oddball flourishes and well-disguised social commentary . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1443,"screenplay : laurie craig . director : john roberts . mpaa rating : pg ( mild profanity , adult humor ) running time : 90 minutes . even before i was a film critic , i was a studio marketing executive's worst nightmare . the standard for selling films has long been to provide an easy frame of reference for the potential viewer , some comparison to a well-known and well-liked predecessor to latch on to . "" from the director of independence day "" one ad might trumpet , while another features a critical comment that the film is "" the best romance since ghost . "" such tactics have long left me skeptical , fearing yet another bandwagon-riding copycat rather than looking forward to something with enough substance or style to stand on its own . in my heart , i know paulie is an attempt to cash in on the family film success of recent talking animal pictures like babe and homeward bound . if your first instinct is to think of paulie as a dopey rip-off , be prepared for a pleasant surprise . paulie may never reach the enchanting heights of babe , but it's consistently charming in its own low-key way . though the adventures are basic and sometimes silly , they are accompanied by lessons gently taught . simple stuff , to be sure , but more edifying family fare than a dozen recent disney films put together . more generally , paulie is a family film which doesn't begin with the assumption that young audiences respond only to stupidity . with the exception of a token instance of flatulence humor and a few coarse insults , scripter laurie craig keeps the gags above the belt , opting to use animal tricks and verbal sparring for amusement . jay mohr's paulie is an obvious hommage to buddy hackett ( obvious enough that hackett shows up in a cameo ) , but he creates just enough feisty personality to make the bird's story matter without making him annoying . paulie also features an unusually strong cast , headed by a grandmotherly rowlands and the always appealing shalhoub ( adding a russian accent to his nationality of the week repertoire ) . this is one feature parents and kids will be able to sit through together with smiles on every face . it would be easy to embrace paulie excessively simply because it doesn't crash into a pile of singed green feathers the way you might expect . in fact , it's hardly a classic-in-the-making . most disappointing of all is a conclusion which leaves us with an odd romantic pairing as its happy ending . it's an uneven effort , but it's satisfying to note that it's actually an _effort_ . paulie could have cruised along on talking animals and foolishness ; instead , it tells a story of friendship and good manners with a few sharp jokes . how nice to find a fun bit of entertainment , and not just "" the best talking animal movie since babe .

1444,"mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 108 minutes . everything i needed to know about the themes of the butcher boy , it turns out , i learned from the opening titles sequence . but it's not just family strife which eventually turns francie into a monster . there is a perverse fascination to watching francie grow progressively more demented , but eventually it becomes clear that there's not much more to the butcher boy than that . it's tough to work up much sympathy for francie when he's treated by co-writer and director neil jordan like a lab rat in a grand sociological experiment -- how much hate and violence can one boy absorb until he snaps ? for a story on a serious subject , it's not always easy to take the butcher boy seriously . then again , it's pretty clear that jordan isn't interested in having us take it seriously . the butcher boy is a truly odd black-humored concoction which treats francie's many traumas with more whimsy than consternation . jordan's approach is consistently surprising , taking even a tired device like omnipresent voice-over narration ( also provided by rea as the adult francie ) and turning it into a bizarre duet between past and present . with elliot goldenthal providing a jaunty underscore to everything from youthful play to the discovery of a murder scene , the butcher boy remains strangely amusing enough to keep you watching . that , unfortunately , is about as far as jordan goes . as a comedy , it's a fairly original collection of sick chuckles . as a drama , it offers pat answers and too little insight , putting us through episodic paces without offering more to learn about its main character than we learned from the first 90 seconds or so : keep your boys away from television and comic books unless you want them going crazy on you . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1445,"written , produced and directed by nick broomfield . mpaa rating : unrated ( could be r for profanity , nudity and adult themes ) running time : 97 minutes . by the end of nick broomfield's controversy-plagued documentary kurt & courtney , i think i knew as much about broomfield himself as i knew about kurt cobain or courtney love . the film might have begun as a biographical study , exploring the tempestuous tives of nirvana lead singer cobain and riot grrrl-cum-actress love both before and after their 1992 marriage , but that's not the story it ends up telling . instead , it becomes the tale of broomfield's ongoing battle with love over the making of the film -- her successful efforts to persuade mtv to withdraw funding , her objection to the use of several songs , her attempts to intimidate anyone involved in the production . no one can blame broomfield for being infuriated at love , particularly when her 11th-hour legal stunt forced kurt & courtney out of the sundance film festival lineup . it might have been easier to sympathize with him , however , if his presence in the film weren't so consistently intrusive . like michael moore , broomfield has no qualms about filming himself in the process of making his documentary film ; unlike moore , broomfield isn't entertaining enough to warrant all the screen time . in fact , he's just plain annoying at times , interjecting commentary over virtually every musical selection ( or lack thereof ) and casually referring to cobain's hometown of aberdeen , washington as a "" redneck logging town . "" even his habit of shooting from inside the car as it pulls up to various locations feels pretentious , an attempt at you-are-there urgency which conveniently ignores that automotive jaunts hardly make for compelling cinema . lucky for broomfield that his subject is such a wild and provocative one . watching the kind of people with whom kurt and courtney surrounded themselves makes you wonder why both of them didn't end up dead long before . it's far more damning in its contention that love's drive for fame and success tends to crush everything in its path , and that her history of verbal and physical assaults is just a hair's breadth removed from her obsessive need to control her public image . it would have been chilling to watch that personality connected more directly to cobain's psychological disintegration , but the troubled soul has little more than a cameo role in the film . kurt & courtney tends to drift away from its potentially fascinating subject ; it's a record of celebrity turned caustic , intercut with a record of a film-maker's pique . you almost wonder why he didn't call the film kurt & courtney & nick . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

"" crazy people was less than completely successful because it didn't have a shred of story to offer once you got past the admittedly hilarious snippets of truth in advertising . bulworth is less than completely successful because it has _too much_ story , none of it in keeping with the frivolous , politically incorrect tone of its trailers . beatty crafts a solid opening as we see bulworth reduced to tears while watching a videotaped compendium of his television spots bashing affirmative action , preaching family falues and mouthing platitudes about "" standing on the doorstep of a new millennium . "" it's a dark and provocative tale , one which could easily turn off viewers who come in expecting something completely different . though he deftly inserts most of his social commentary into rap-style lyrics -- somehow a rapped lecture sounds less like a lecture -- it's still an aggressive attack on the powers that be as beatty sees them . add to this a tentative romance between bulworth and a young black woman ( halle berry ) , the intrusion of the hit-man sub-plot and even a bit of fish-out-of-water comedy as bulworth hides out in the 'hood , and you end up with a film that's more jittery than edgy . bulworth keeps lashing out in search of its tone -- one moment goofy and irreverent , the next moment grim and pedantic . there's nothing inherently wrong with a comedy delivering its goods unconventionally , provided the goods are delivered . there are plenty of comic high points in bulworth , including platt's superb performance as bulworth's ever-more-frantic right hand man and the shoot-from-the-hip speeches already showcased in previews . even if you agree with those politics , you may find bulworth leaving a strange and unpleasant aftertaste ; you'll know you've seen an interesting film , but you may feel cheated by the kind of film you got . i suspect viewers will wish they'd seen more of bulworth's comic rantings . perhaps this ad campaign could have used a dose of crazy people's truth in advertising . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

"" cute "" films are becoming harder and harder to find , however , and this one keeps things light enough to sidestep any of shyer and meyers' more saccharine impulses . every once in a while , uncomplicated and inoffensive fun feels just right . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1455,"i know what you're probably thinking about dance with me , because it's the same thing i was thinking . this would be nothing more than a bunch of dance sequences strung together by something that could only be called a plot if you were being particularly generous . even the film's trailer , which featured about a dozen words in two minutes , contributed to the impression that dance with me wouldn't be about characters , but about plastic wind-up dance toys masquerading as characters . yes , the film's original title -- shut up and dance -- would certainly prove prescient . i'll tell you what i wasn't expecting : one of the year's most appealing , charismatic performances . ruby is an enigma to rafael , since her fierce dedication to dancing doesn't seem to be connected to any real joy . simple stuff , to be sure -- perhaps even simplistic -- but dance with me sells its simplicity almost entirely on the strength of chayanne's appeal . though it's certainly helpful that he's has boyish good looks and an inviting smile , his success can't be dismissed as purely hormonal . he has to anchor both of the film's big emotional hooks -- tentative attempts to connect with the father he has never known , and the romance with williams -- in spite of a language barrier , which he does by acting with his face and body language as well as any young performer of the last several years . chayanne has that intangible something called presence , something that gets you more involved in a simple story than the material probably deserves . that presence is most forceful when he hits the dance floor in an exhilarating sequence at a latin dance club . the sequence hinges on rafael conveying to ruby the pure joy of dance , and that joy explodes from his every movement . as obviously choreographed as some of the "" spontaneous "" moves in the club might be , it's still infectious to watch when rafael seems to be having so much fun . anyone who can invoke singin' in the rain without inspiring gasps at the sacrilege has to be doing something right . first-time screenwriter daryl matthews ( also the film's choreographer ) makes the mistake of making ruby's conflict central at a time in the narrative when there's already plenty of conflict to go around . director randa haines , meanwhile , makes the mistake of spending too much time showing us the competition itself . if the point was to prove how much more exciting club dancing is than regimented competitive dancing , that point is made and made again for nearly half an hour , including ridiculous comic relief from joan plowright as a spunky geriatric . the solid chemistry between williams and chayanne is lost , the father-son relationship is buried and the dancing rapidly grows tiresome . predictable though the story may have been , at least is was energetic . dance with me decides to turn into a dance movie exactly when the dancing is least interesting , and after the hero has made his impression . his charisma makes much of the film watchable , until it reaches the point where , much to your disappointment , they make him and everyone else just shut up and dance . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1457,"[note : some of the content in this review may be considered spoilers] the risk , of course , is that knowing the outcome way ahead of time might somehow reduce its emotional impact . how effective can a tear-jerker be if you're waiting for them to be jerked ? one true thing deftly sidesteps that problem -- at least for half its running time -- by being nothing at all like a conventional tear-jerker . at its core , it tells a story of one of adulthood's most daunting tasks : coming to terms with the humanity of one's parents . as long as the focus remains on those three characters and their relationships , one true thing is solid film-making . meryl streep delivers yet another winning performance , finding the warmth and compassion in kate without ever turning her into a cartoon . the small mannerisms in her attempts to connect with ellen -- an almost imperceptible rejected touch , hidden disappointment at her daughter's dismissals of her -- are the stuff great screen acting is made of . the guldens are a thoroughly recognizable modern family , their interactions real enough to evoke emotion and sympathy without resorting to sobs or recriminations . there's something particularly wrenching about watching people who love each other trying to like each other . alas , the plot device which brought ellen back home soon rears its head and pulls one true thing in the wrong direction . it's not that the cancer storyline is mawkish or overly manipulative . indeed , franklin's direction and streep's performance avoid most of the traps which can turn such stories into melodrama . once the big c starts taking over the proceedings , the nuances of character which had made one true thing such compelling viewing begin to lose their force . conversations become confrontations ; the words sound progressively more scripted and less genuine . a tighter , leaner screenplay might have been able to keep ellen's journey of discover squarely at the center of one true thing . there's only one true thing which makes one true thing glow with realism , and that's the struggle of parents and their adult children to deal with each other as adults , as equals , as fellow human beings . that's the reason it was so wise to remove the live-or-die suspense from a story that's not about who will live or die . that's also the reason it was so disappointing to watch the film linger on a foregone conclusion . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1458,"mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 109 minutes . what dreams may come , a sort of post-mortem romantic fantasy-drama , shows us a world which is unlike any we've seen before on screen . oh sure , plenty of films have ventured into the realms of the afterlife , from the sublime ( defending your life ) to the ridiculous ( jacob's ladder ) . this , however , is a heaven of a different , considerably gaudier color . those scenes in chris's heaven-of-his-own-making highlight what dreams may come at its finest , creating spectacularly imaginative visions of the next world . unfortunately , those same scenes also highlight the film's most glaring weakness . it's an inevitable part of metaphysical fantasies like this that someone has to bring the audience up to speed on exactly what they're seeing and why . that doesn't make it any less tedious , especially when what dreams may come isn't supposed to be about what makes particular cosmic gears turn the way they do . the scenes of chris's earthly life with his family , strewn throughout the film in a near-subliminal series of flashbacks , form a potent back-story of a life which isn't as suburban-ideal as it first appears . there's something compelling about the suggetion that love doesn't have to be perfect to be powerful . those emotions should have carried what dreams may come to a transcendent level , if not for those nagging distractions . it's not just the constant exposition which causes the problems , either . an even bigger distraction is robin williams , whose performance can't quite capture the aching love he's supposed to be feeling . williams is certainly a fine performer , but there are times when he's giving a "" serious "" performance that he looks like he's trying way too hard . the furrows in his brow , the perpetually fidgeting lip and the over-dramatized line readings turn too many interpersonal moments into exercises in how not to act on the big screen . annabella sciorra's convincing anguish could have grounded the story in heart-breaking reality if williams hadn't kept pulling it into melodrama . again , the marvelous look of the film draws you in , as annie's shattered mindscape takes the form of the nielsens' home turned a desolate grey . and again , a viewer is pulled away from the look of the film by tortuous exposition and emotional confrontations which only feel genuine on one side . what dreams may come will likely wring tears from those entranced by the ghost-like prospect of romance beyond the pale . for others , it will seem like a missed opportunity . if a tale of primal fears and primal emotions can't grab you without a nattering narrator , something's very wrong . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1461,"so much for adam sandler , "" normal "" guy . while still fairly silly in its own way , the wedding singer was a somewhat more mature , somewhat more clever vehicle for sandler , and his first attempt at actual screen acting . in the waterboy , sandler is once again in infantile , silly-voiced rare form , the kind of character that strikes unholy terror in a critic's heart . it would be a gross exaggeration to call the waterboy a smart film , but it's funny in ways i didn't quite expect . the opening minutes of the waterboy don't hold out much hope for anything beyond 12-year-old comic sensibilities . sight gags predominate , from a football hitting bobby in the head , to pratfalls over a water cooler , to sandler motoring about on a riding lawn mower . a few giggles leak out of the predictabe sophomorism , while sandler's stuttering , soft-spoken variation on cajun man threatens to wear out his welcome very early on . sandler starts getting more endearingly innocent rather than acting like an oblivious moron . and the sight gags start getting funnier , perhaps as much related to a build-up of good will as to any change in approach . the incongruous presence of bates and winker ( the latter sporting decidedly un-fonzie-esque love handles ) certainly helps , but there's something about the writing in the waterboy that kept sneaking up on me , delivering a left-field laugh at times when i was expecting an obvious bit of slapstick idiocy . many people probably associate sandler with moron comedy in the ernest/pauly shore/carrot top vein , perhaps without having seen any of his films . he and frequent writing partner tim herlihy are considerably more sly than that . they've learned a few lessons in grown-up comedy from the wedding singer , and bring that sensibility to the lower common denominator audience targeted with the waterboy . they certainly miss the target plenty of times -- rob schneider's extended cameo gets more insufferable every time he appears -- but they also don't fire at the same stupid target over and over again . between the lethargic opening and the who-cares romance between sandler and bad girl fairuza balk , the waterboy offers goofy entertainment . it appears sandler doesn't have to be "" normal "" to be funny . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1463,"screenplay : david marconi . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 127 minutes . director tony scott presents what sometimes seems like a documentary on electronic surveillance in enemy of the state . it's a great button-pushing premise for a millenial-angst-heavy information age , full of shadowy government operations and technological voyeurism of every shape and form . the first time a chase scene spills over with surveillance details , it's effective and alarming . the second time , you start to notice that it drags scenes out much longer than they need to be . the third , fourth and fifth times , you wonder why the omniscient gadgetry is beginning to seem more cool than scary . is this a movie about people oppressed by electronics , or a commercial for electronics ? fortunately , the human angle is in the capable hands of will smith . in his first purely starring role -- no buddy cop , no aliens -- smith continues to show the charisma of a star . he's a more effective hounded everyman than you might expect , cracking wise when it serves the moment while generally handling his predicament with intelligence and resolve . hackman arrives fairly late in the film to provide some requisite bonding moments , but mostly the weight of enemy of the state falls squarely on smith's shoulders . he proves more than capable of handling it . he also gets to work with an action/thriller script considerably more coherent than average . the resolution is a rushed disappointment -- mixing in a dopey mob sub-plot just when the table-turning pleasures of dean and brill watching the watchmen had been so promising -- but for nearly two hours it's pretty a effective story . with scott keeping the pacing steady and intense , all the script needs to do is avoid situations so obviously stupid that you feel insulted . marconi's script may not be impressive , but it's unobtrusive , which is one of the higher compliments you can pay an action/thriller script in 1998 . still , there's the matter of all those gee-whiz shots of satellite cams , computer extrapolations and general manipulation of technology . sure it's unsettling to consider that the only privacy you may have is inside your head , but it's most unsettling if we connect with a character connecting with that reality the hard way . will smith provides that humanity almost in spite of scott's inventory of spy gear . the director takes the edge off the edgy concept , turning in a solid thriller that hypes us up when it should be freaking us out . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1464,"it's really rather a slick conceit when you stop to think about it -- telling the tale of the early years of the reign of queen elizabeth i ( cate blanchett ) with the virgin queen turned into michael corleone . it's all played as grand opera , with the initially uncertain monarch surrounded by advisors of every possible motivation . screenwriter michael hirst and director shekhar kapur manage to keep all these balls in the air quite deftly , moving back and forth between the machinations of various factions while keeping all the players clearly defined . ultimately , however , elizabeth is more a well-crafted plot structure than a great tragic drama . as solid as most of the cast members are , they aren't asked to do much more than furrow their brows and skulk . at least it's all quite a spectacle to behold . the radiant blanchett makes a wonderful elizabeth , though her chemistry with joseph fiennes isn't nearly as invigorating as it was with brother ralph in oscar and lucinda . it's a consistently engaging film , but one which never crosses over into being truly captivating . while aiming for the epic sweep of a godfather film , the film-makers seem to have forgotten that coppola created an epic of relationships , not just political alliances . elizabeth is that rare film that would have been much better if it had been much longer . if it had offered the chance to feel the personalities of history as well as watch them , it would have been an offer you couldn't refuse . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1465,"jane horrocks delivers a show-stopping stage performance in little voice , the kind worthy of the divas she honors . the most astonishing element of horrocks' performance is that she gets no assistance from the original vocalists . the actress truly can do frighteningly dead-on recreations of garland , dietrich , holliday , monroe and half a dozen others , and its a wonder to behold . the showcase for both horrocks and her character is a performance at a run-down cabaret , set up by mari's current flame , small-time talent scout ray say ( michael caine ) . in a live theater setting , you can imagine horrocks' musical numbers being positively electrifying . even on-screen her transformation from minnie mouse to mighty mouth is grand theater at its finest , and the renditions of standards like "" get happy "" and "" i wanna be loved by you "" are extremely appealing . it doesn't take long , however , to realize that little voice is built entirely around horrocks' admittedly impressive party trick . as flawed as ray and mari are , they deserve better than to vanish after receiving a comeuppance . it's frustrating watching them reduced to impediments to l . v . 's ability finally to spread her wings ( and it's not as though the bird metaphor isn't beaten to an ugly death ) . it's all the more disappointing because , for most of its running time , little voice doesn't seem headed that way at all . its eccentric characters , while stagey , all have their goofy appeal , particularly jim broadbent as the nightclub's cheesy owner/emcee . director mark herman develops his small-town atmosphere nicely , and his adapted screenplay keeps the humor fairly consistent . it's actually nearly half an hour into the film before l . v . breaks into song for the first time , allowing ample time to build the significance of the characters and their relationships . then comes l . v . 's big debut , and it starts to seem that everyone else was just part of the warm-up act . l . v . emerges from her shell , she sings and she changes , and about as abruptly as you can imagine , the credits begin to roll . little voice is largely diverting in its way , and horrocks is truly wonderful , but eventually it's somewhat disappointing . i didn't expect to leave the theater feeling that an ensemble story had been turned into a one-woman show of judymania . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1466,"i'll admit that i didn't rent the original psycho last night so i could make my shot-by-shot comparison with a fresh memory . i'm fairly certain hitchcock didn't make it explicit that master bates was masturbating while watching marion crane disrobe , the opening helicopter shot was definitely new , and i can't recall near-subliminal shots of gathering storm clouds edited into the legendary "" shower scene . "" otherwise , everything appeared pretty consistent with my recollection . director gus van sant -- for reasons he has given anywhere from "" why not remake a good film instead of a bad film ? "" to just plain "" why not ? "" -- had indeed taken one of american cinema's most iconic horror films , dipped it in color , and served it up whole to a new generation of movie-goers . the metronomic repetition of "" why "" is a bit futile at this point , but i'm willing to hazard my own guess as to the answer : van sant wanted to remind viewers what a brilliant director alfred hitchcock was , and what a brilliant example of direction psycho was in particular . i hope viewers ( and critics ) don't fold their arms in indignation so tightly against their chests that they fail to recognize how incredibly suspenseful and tautly paced the first hour of this psycho is . heretical though it may seem to say so , the first half of this psycho is better than the original , because heche's interpretation of marion is better than janet leigh's . the staging -- hitch's ominous angles , bernard herrmann's chilling score -- masterfully builds the tension , but it also allows us watch heche's mind work , and she's as fiercely intelligent an actress as we have today . while the narrative is focused on marion's flight , it really flies . there's nothing exactly wrong with vaughn's performance , which is edgy and scary . towering over every other actor in the piece , his good looks untamed by a bad haircut , vaughn is far too physically intimidating to play the meek , sexually repressed basket case . he throws the entire second half of the film out of whack , leaving the audience with nothing to do but watch van sant and his cast play out the rest of the film . there are any number of reasons why a psycho nearly 40 years removed from the well-known original can't work quite as well . the shower scene is now a film-school standby as minutely dissected as the zapruder film , not a viscerally shocking surprise ; familiarity with the true nature of norman's "" mother "" makes some of his dialogue unintentionally humorous . but there's no question that it does still work as an example of building terror through film-making skill . it also shows that the success of particular choices may be built around the casting . the best choice with anthony perkins as norman does not equal the best choice with vince vaughn as norman -- it's chaos theory at its finest applied to the art of directing . this incarnation of psycho isn't a forgery of a great work of art . it's more like a photo of a great work in an art history textbook -- a bit flat , but intriguing enough to make you want to get a better look at the real thing . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1467,"screenplay : michael piller . director : jonathan frakes . mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , violence ) running time : 101 minutes . by now , every "" star trek "" fan deserving of the name is familiar with the "" odd-even "" rule for the feature films . the second , fourth , sixth and eighth films in the series have been the most entertaining ; the first , third , fifth and seventh , not so much . star trek : insurrection , the latest biannual return of the "" next generation "" cast , marks the ninth big-screen journey into the trek universe , inspiring a combination of trepidation and hope . could this finally be the adventure which would break the odd-number jinx ? well , not exactly . star trek : insurrection is an average story , competently told , energized primarily by the chance to mingle once again with the characters from the "" next generation "" television series . it seems that radiation on the ba'ku planet possesses a "" fountain of youth "" quality which makes it incredibly valuable , particularly to the genetically deteriorating son'a . star trek : insurrection , like most of the films in the series , is clearly designed to appeal to the trek faithful first , and to a broader audience second . that's one of the qualities which makes insurrection feel as fragmented as it does . over the course of a 100 minute film , trying to give seven characters enough to do to keep them happy leads to plenty of punch lines but not enough focus . stewart has the presence to make virtually anything he does feel commanding , but there's always a sense that he should have _more_ to do . just as he was always the best thing about the "" next generation "" series , he's the bext thing about the "" next generation "" films , whether playing the fool in a ceremonial headdress or radiating moral courage . stewart as picard is almost always going to be a good enough reason to watch a trek film , while watching him step back for the good of the ensemble will always be a bit disappointing . there are other good reasons to see this particular film , including some sharply-staged action sequences ( frakes showed a similar facility in 1996's first contact ) and plenty of belly laughs . there are also other reasons to be disappointed , including a wasted villain in f . murray abraham and a resolution which you may miss if you blink . altogether it feels a bit small for the big screen , more like a solid episode of the series ( complete with obvious allegory ) than a film . perhaps there aren't that many great ideas for trek features to go around , and maybe that's why the heirs to gene roddenberry's vision manage to come up with a really good one only once every four years . if they decided not to make a movie every two years , and waited until that really good idea was ready , they could eliminate that "" odd-even "" problem once and for all . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1468,"down in the delta , a paean to the importance of family ties , stays such a course of earnestness and muted conflict that it's hard to work up much emotion about the people involved . the first act of down in the delta gets it off to a rocky start , presenting the inner city background with all the urgency of a generic studio back-lot . it's important to the film's themes that the city feel chaotic , a fragmented collection of people from fragmented homes , but it feels false right down to the crack-house apartment where loretta goes to get high ; even the always-reliable woodard appears adrift in some mediocre tv-drama episode . director maya angelou almost seems afraid of getting her hands dirty , as though the story's more uplifting message will be sullied by showing inner city life at its worst . down in the delta gets much stronger when the setting shifts south , and not just because the location feels more genuine . al freeman jr . radiates patriarchal gravity and moral strength as uncle earl , his keen eyes providing an added intelligence to every word of wisdom from his lips . screenwriter myron goble occasionally pushes too hard on these themes , stumbling over the vague estrangement of earl's son will ( wesley snipes ) , but freeman is always there to bring them back into focus . you never doubt for a moment that earl is the kind of man who can straighten out the lives of others not by lecturing to them , but by showing them the right way . down in the delta is the kind of film you'll probably walk out of with a good feeling , even though you may not necessarily have enjoyed it all that much . the key dramatic points prove to be exceedingly tame stuff , adding to the impression that the film is just cruising along on the momentum of its good intentions . usually films of this kind struggle by becoming too strident ; this one struggles by being not nearly strident enough . freeman alone makes this film worth watching , guiding both viewers and other characters to an understanding of what can be accomplished through a sense of shared responsibility . still , it should have been easier to be more supportive of a film with as many valuable things to say . down in the delta's soft-spoken drama is more likely to move you to respectful nods than to social action . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1469,"director : bill condon . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , nudity , adult themes , sexual situations ) running time : 105 minutes . ian mckellen -- who has already won two year-end critics' awards as of this writing -- has a sinfully great time in gods and monsters . growling innuendo and wrapping his lips around a cigar that's not just a cigar , mckellen fashions whale early on as a dirty old man with little left to embrace but his own lasciviousness . there's no question that mckellen's work is a great time . . . great acting , not necessarily . in every other way the characters are completely dissimilar -- hurt played a timid professor who had lived his entire life as a straight husband , while mckellen takes on a flamboyant artist utterly at ease with his lifestyle . hurt's was the more difficult role , one in which a small man confronted upheaval and potential humiliation ; mckellen got a part full of punch lines and haunted recollections , the stuff actors turn into audition monologues . james whale isn't a role that requires a great performance . it's a role that requires an _entertaining_ performance . and entertaining it is , particularly in service of whale's intriguing biography . writer/director bill condon makes it evident that whale's affinity for creating screen monsters was born of sympathy , one outcast giving voice and soul to other outcasts . he even makes the sly suggestion that whale was also the father of camp , creating intentionally humorous films from horror stories as a sop to his own amused sensibilities . mckellen makes whale far too inventive to be pathetic , yet also shows him fighting with the shadow of his former self . but there's another character gobbling up chunks of screen time , and that's brendan fraser as the wrong-side-of-the-tracks gardener . it's a solid enough performance by fraser , but there's something trite about the entire structure of clay's friendship with whale , nearly as trite as lynn redgrave's fussy german housekeeper . it reaches the point where the story actually appears to be about clay , which is a big mistake . mckellen's performance may not be perfect , but it's still the best thing about gods and monsters . it's not incredibly touching , and it's not incredibly profound . it is , however , quite a lot of fun for a while . there are worse places to cast your lot than with the year's second best performance as an older gay man trying to woo a young heterosexual . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1470,"it's difficult to explain how 85 minutes of effortless charm could be neutralized by one scene without giving away the ending of waking ned devine . as a film critic i almost always champion films that take narrative risks , avoiding the plague of the obvious . waking ned devine takes just such a risk , but the result feels like a particularly nasty bait-and-switch . where many films err with gratuitous sentimentality , this one errs with a gratuitous lack of sentimentality . the most frustrating thing is that so much of it is so entertaining . the sequence in which jackie and michael try to set up the deception , caught off-guard by mr . kelly's early arrival , shows director kirk jones to have a rare sort of comic timing . farce rarely works on film the way it works on a stage , but waking ned devine fires on every cylinder -- game actors in a great comic situation guided by a talented director . initially , the whole business seems to be little more than a distraction , an excuse for gags about odor and fruity soaps . and it is here , friends , that waking ned devine takes its left turn into black comedy and bleak morality . plenty of viewers will walk away from waking ned devine believing they have seen a feel-good film with a happy ending , but it is an entirely contrary reaction which blunted my enthusiasm . i laughed and laughed and laughed through much of the film . then i gasped . then i fumed . waking ned devine sheds its sympathy and its sense of good humor for what , in retrospect , feels like a cheap shock and a toast to situational ethics . 85 minutes of effortless charm counts for a lot . if only one scene didn't make it count for so much less . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1471,"producers : robert michael geisler & john roberdeau and grant hill . director : terrence malick . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , brief nudity , adult themes ) running time : 168 minutes . the announcement that the thin red line would mark terrence malick's return to the director's chair after a twenty year absence was greeted as the cinematic equivalent of j . d . salinger popping open his smith-corona to give it another go . this was , after all , the hermit-genius of great american movie-making , whose only two previous films -- badlands and days of heaven -- were spoken of in tones of reverence . yet try as i might , i couldn't work up the same enthusiasm . as adept as malick was at crafting stunning visuals , narrative seemed to be an afterthought to him , something to be cobbled together with voice-over narration . good films , yes , and profoundly beautiful ones , but not profound ones . malick reaches for profundity once again in the thin red line ; the result is another good , great-looking tone poem where deep thoughts stand in the way of genuine drama . it's instantly clear that malick intends to take the thin red line in a very different direction from jones' novel . jones , while he frequently found his way into the heads of his characters , was equally concerned with providing a vivid sense of the physical -- the oppressive heat and humidity , the boots full of water , and the insect attacks that challenged the men on guadalcanal before a single shot was fired . for long stretches of the thin red line , malick seems to forget that these characters have bodies at all . the incessant koan-like philosophizing becomes aggravating enough , but it's even more frustrating that every one of the men , from the law school-educated staros to kentucky-bred farm boy witt , thinks in the same college-sophomore-on-a- double-bong-hit , my-fingernail-could-be-a-whole-nother-universe terms . with only a couple of notable exceptions -- bell's obsessive love for his wife , and tall's careerist self-loathing -- malick's internal monologues turn the characters into an indistinct jumble of existential angst . ironically , the thin red line is at its best when it does get down and dirty , following the company's assault on a well-defended japanese hill position . it's a superb piece of kinetic war film-making , the camera bursting through tall grass as soldiers are cut down during a suicidal head-on attack . there's more poetry and insight as the men discover what battle will make of them than there is in an hour's worth of navel-gazing and heavy-handed juxtapositions of war ( "" bad "" ) and nature ( "" good "" ) . there's little question that the thin red line is an aesthetic wonder , shot by john toll in fickle available light and edited into a wartime koyaanisqatsi . and it all might have worked much better if malick had let viewers draw their own messages from the images , rather than letting a soldier inform us that "" war don't ennoble men . . . it even that tactic might have worked better if the voices had been distinctive , or if there were some exploration of esprit de corps which connected these men to one another . each character in the thin red line is living too squarely inside his own head to connect much with anyone else . that sentiment applies to terrence malick as well , who returns from his two decade sabbatical for three hours of stunningly photographed , overwrought introspection . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1472,"if it's december or january , it must be time for "" triumph over illness/handicap "" films . into this crowded field comes the theory of flight , a quirky comedy-drama of romantic friendship starring kenneth branagh as richard hawkins , an artist so flighty that he actually does try to take flight . . . right off the roof of a building . cue soaring music and inspirational message . well , not exactly . thus unfolds a singularly odd sort of film , at once a dark comedy , an unconventional love story and , yes , a triumph over illness/handicap film . the strange thing about the theory of flight is that it's not always clear whose triumph over a handicap will be the focus of the film . as the narrative progresses , it becomes ever more clear that richard is the real protagonist of the piece , the character who is supposed to learn and change through this experience . unfortunately , he's also the character who is least interesting , and makes the least sense . there's something emotionally amiss with this fellow , that's for certain ; exactly what that something is , not so much . kenneth branagh ( apparently still suffering side effects from channeling woody allen in celebrity ) is all neurotic discomfort and goofy twitches . the character's intense desire to follow through on the bank robbery falls somewhere between melodramatic affectation and sincere-though-misguided expression of resolve , when only one or the other would truly clarify things . jane is a superb piece of characterization , never merely the self-pitying , hard-on-the-outside-soft-on-the-inside person with a handicap that has become such a cinematic cliche . though it's a challenging bit of physical acting for bonham carter to wrap her mouth around jane's slurred speech and adopt the distinctive movements , her finest moment is a silent one -- a pleading glance at richard as her voice synthesizer plays her recorded request . it's the clash between our interest in those two characters which prevents the theory of flight from soaring to the highest possible level . while richard's awakening to his own self-indulgence may be the point , it's still tedious watching him indulge himself when watching jane is so much more interesting . perhaps the problem is that there is too much high-concept to this tale , too many silly little bits of business to distract from genuine interaction between the two principal characters . it's hard for a love story to be great when you want one of the lovers to end up happy , and the other just to end up an adult . you have to commend the theory of flight for taking a slightly different flight plan towards soaring inspiration . it just can't quite get there on only one good wing . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1473,"director : paul schrader . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 114 minutes . schrader forgot those things while adapting russell banks' affliction . working with all the elements for a raw dramatic masterwork , he appears unclear how to tell the story through to its conclusion . and in a fit of panic , he turns the final minutes of the film into a mess of ham-fisted plot summary and perplexing epilogue . it's a crying shame , because the set-up for affliction is so utterly compelling . the heart , soul and twisted guts of affliction lie in nick nolte's performance as wade , as beaten-down a human being as the screen has ever seen without turning him into a "" lovable loser . "" initially , the narration is simply florid and unnecessary ; later , it begins to repeat entire scenes just completed , as though afraid we might have just walked in from the lobby and missed something . finally , the narration becomes absolutely insufferable , summing up every theme from the previous two hours in a few tidy sentences that makes you wonder why you spent your time with wade instead of his self-appointed shrink . that narration is part of an attrocious conclusion that nearly ruins the film , tagging on explanations of much that has gone before and some that comes after . either schrader ran out of money to show us all this significant material , or he ran out of ideas regarding how to do it . perhaps such a gaping hole in the resolution of the protagonist's story should have ruined the film , but there's too much else that works in affliction . cinematographer paul sarossy , who captured russell banks' winter mindscapes previously in the sweet hereafter , captures a sense of chilly isolation , and the supporting cast -- notably coburn's casually emasculating turn as pop -- is solid top to bottom . there's an ache at the core of affliction as painful as the rotting tooth that , in a shakespearean display of psychic corruption manifested through physical corruption , torments wade through much of the film . there will also be an ache in the head of many viewers , as schrader spends the film's critical final minutes beating them with a moral to the story that anyone able to add single-digit numbers should comprehend unassisted . it may have worked for travis bickle , but here schrader's use of narration nearly trumps nolte's triumph . it's enough to make an edgy critic ask , "" are you _still_ talkin' to me ?

1474,"screenplay : andrew kevin walker . producers : judy hofflund , gavin polone and joel schumacher . director : joel schumacher . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , violence , nudity ) running time : 121 minutes . i don't think i want to know what andrew kevin walker dreams about . as to joel schumacher's dreams , i think i can venture a pretty good guess . it would seem that the creative sensibilities of these two men couldn't be farther apart , which is one of the reasons 8mm feels like an edgy , intriguing missed opportunity . every time walker tries to drive the narrative into the realm of the unnerving , schumacher drags it back into the merely kinky . the premise for 8mm involves that most enduring of pornographic urban legends , the snuff film . cage is a great choice for a character like tom welles -- the capacity for lunatic action always seems to hide just behind his placid features -- but the character himself is something of a puzzle . if that question had been answered more effectively , 8mm might have struck a more resonant chord . as it stands , it's still a pretty gripping little thriller at times . the first hour pokes along at something of a crawl , which somehow works more often than it doesn't , perhaps because it's indicative of welles' tenacity . the supporting performances are solid , with joaquin phoenix making a savvy sidekick for welles , and peter stormare seething sleaze as a porn film director . the deliberate pacing eventually gives way to some tense showdowns as the film builds to its climax , including a search for a killer in which the driving sound of thrash metal music suddenly becomes the eerie metronome of the runout groove . 8mm is rarely a bore , and often finds the slick energy of the most effective dark action films . it's too bad that slickness works against 8mm nearly as often as it works for it . the bleak triumph of seven came not primarily through walker's fairly straightforward serial killer script , but through director david fincher's brilliantly subliminal direction ; the violence lurked at the edges of the frame , where our minds put gruesome pieces together . joel schumacher is a more grandiose sort of filmmaker , one who has no problem thrusting the details of an s&m film into the dead center of the screen . his version of the smoky basements where the hardcore deviants lurk is too literal , and indeed there's something about tom welles' entire journey that is too literal . the director isn't exactly trying to titillate the audience , but he's not helping the writer's study of how one man responds to the destruction of innocence . it may be enough that 8mm is just a decently constructed thriller . it's just not a gut-rattler , more the sort of thing you get when the director of batman & robin tries to do apocalyptic menace . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1475,"screenplay : pamela gray . director : tony goldwyn . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , nudity , profanity , adult themes , drug use ) running time : 105 minutes . a walk on the moon is a coming-of-age film , which may lead you to expect the fetishizing of adolescent sexual experimentation ; it's set during 1969's summer of love -- and at woodstock , no less -- which may lead you to expect even more "" wonder years "" -esque navel-gazing than usual . there are some pleasant surprises in a walk on the moon , actor tony goldwyn's directing debut , but the most pleasant may be that it's mature . taking a unique perspective on that singularly revolutionizing american summer , it's a simple , occasionally corny story with enough wisdom to realize that comings-of-age don't happen exclusively to teenagers . this summer seems certain to be something different , however . pearl's story is a particularly interesting one to set during a time of social upheaval . though gray occasionally turns her subtext into overly melodramatic text ( alison : "" you had your chance to be the kid ! "" pearl : "" no , i didn't ! "" ) , a walk on the moon generally lets diane lane's solid performance bring out pearl's conflicts . goldwyn also does a nice job of creating his 1960s catskills milieu as a distinct , amusing time and place . the portrayals do occasionally drift into the stereotypical , notably tovah feldshuh as marty's predictably iron-willed , oy-spouting mother , but the characters still maintain a sense of individuality even within their own world . when the throng of counterculture kids descends on this world for the generation-defining concert -- including a quick skinny-dip in the camp's private lake -- it provides a well-realized picture of the new freedom that calls to pearl . the only reason a walk on the moon feels awkward is that it fumbles the sub-plot involving alison's own adventures . they take a half-hearted middle ground when one of the two extremes -- focusing entirely on pearl or making the two stories equally significant -- would have been genuinely effective . fortunately , when a walk on the moon sticks with pearl's growth -- including getting to know who her husband _really_ is for the first time -- it's an appealing character study . from its atmosphere to its acting , it's a nicely grown-up story of growing up , not just physically but emotionally . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1476,"screenplay : marc lawrence , based on the original screenplay by neil simon . producers : robert evans , robert w . cort , david madden and teri schwartz . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , sexual situations , drug use ) running time : 88 minutes . the out-of-towners is the sort of film i generally greet with a generous helping of pooh-poohing . it's a remake ( of a neil simon-penned 1970 original which i have never seen ) , it's a vehicle to re-unite two stars of a previous film ( steve martin and goldie hawn , from 1992's housesitter ) , and it's a broad farce cloaked in shallow sentimentality . the out-of-towners often feels like it's working awfully hard to extract its guffaws , yet it still manages to extract its fair share . the comic energy of the three lead performers -- including the incomparable john cleese -- makes this silly trifle something moderately satisfying . it shouldn't be a surprise that the out-of-towners feels derivative , and not just because it's a remake . nearly every element in the film is designed to have the comfort of the familiar , from the pairing of the two stars , to martin's fuming in a planes , trains & automobiles scenario , to hawn's earnest ditziness , to cleese's resurrection of basil fawlty and python-esque cross-dressing . while the script by marc lawrence ( writer of forces of nature , who appears unusually fond of thwarted travel plans as an aphrodisiac ) pauses occasionally so henry and nancy can muse about the nature of their marriage , it's mostly concerned with set-ups for slapstick situations and tirades . at times , those situations and tirades feel forced ; you can practically see hawn and martin screaming to the audience for whoops and applause when they go on their respective rants against someone who gets their goat . at plenty of others , the actors give the old-fashioned farce a kick it rarely gets on screen . even more wonderful is cleese , a comic treasure too rarely seen . he may be able to do smiling misanthropes like his character here in his sleep , but he still sends a charge through the out-of-towners every moment he's on screen . cleese's scenes are reason alone for comedy fans to spend an hour and a half with this film . i do wish the out-of-towners had shown more restraint with its characters , subjecting them to a bit more frustration and a bit less abject humiliation . it's not a subtle film by any stretch of the imagination , but there was enough humor to be found in the performers that we didn't need to see martin taking a hallucinogenic trip with his pants around his ankles . you may find a lot of the out-of-towners familiar and foolish ; you may also find yourself laughing at it in spite of yourself . there's something to be said for the way talented professionals can take predictable material and wring something fresh and funny from it . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1480,"screenplay : mike figgis . director : mike figgis . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , sexual situations , violence , adult themes ) running time : 101 minutes . is the loss of sexual innocence , mike figgis' experimental non-linear tone poem , pretentious ? of course it is -- you've got to have a healthy streak of pretentiousness in you to break free from conventional narrative structure and make something so distinct that it's occasionally confounding . perhaps a better question is whether the loss of sexual innocence is nothing _but_ pretentious . even more so than in most films , the answer to that question will be an eye-of-the-beholder proposition . some will see little more than insufferable , gratuitous , iconoclastic noodling . others will see a film that grips you with many of its images even as it keeps you at an artistic arm's length . though there is no structured "" story "" to the loss of sexual innocence , there is a focal point in the character of nic , seen at various formative stages of his life . what may appear from that description to be a fragmented film actually feels surprisingly cohesive . figgis maintains a consistent tone for his various images , creating a collection of cinematic short stories as thematically connected as hemingway's _a moveable feast_ . the piano music of schumann and chopin trades places with figgis' own compositions , accentuating some magical cinematography by benoit delhomme . if you allow yourself to get lost in the loss of sexual innocence , and avoid succumbing to the temptation to figure out what everything "" means , "" it can wash over your resistance to its unconventionality . and , to be frank , some of it is just plain weird . instead of giving us a view of an inner life , the scenes play out like a parody of dream images , full of dissonant music and shifting realities like a years-too-late outtake from "" twin peaks . "" most baffling and annoying to some will be the garden of eden sequences , which conspicuously match a transluscently nordic eve with a strikingly black adam , both of whom are fully nude in every scene . there's nothing particularly revelatory about figgis' account of the fall but his interracial first parents , nothing visually compelling in his unblinking staredown with innocence personified . that's the level on which the loss of sexual innocence is bound to set to itching those who can't stand it when their art looks this in-your-face art-y . there are times when figgis' efforts grow wearying in their lack of basic resonance with the viewer's experiences . there are also times when he hits the nail spectacularly on the head , and times when the film works on an almost symphonic level . mike figgis wants to use the cinema the way only cinema can be used , and without question he does so . the extent to which this mixed bag of mourning and memory succeeds is a matter for _extremely_ subjective analysis . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1481,"screenplay : oliver parker , based on the play by oscar wilde . director : oliver parker . mpaa rating : pg ( mild profanity , adult themes ) running time : 96 minutes . an ideal husband is so determinedly droll that it's likely to leave your cheeks aching from a sustained 96 minute smirk . that shouldn't be a tremendous shock considering we're talking about a play by oscar wilde , whose penchant for the tres bon mot was matched only by his curious desire to cobble them together into plots . he was smart enough to craft his stories into a crowd-pleasing romantic form , but he was generally less interested in emotional insight than he was in a witty turn of phrase . in the mouths of actors who know how to use them , his epigrams can make you forget that the narrative you're watching is fairly forgettable . there are many such actors in an ideal husband , enough to give the tale some devilish fun . it's a noble idea , though the time isn't particularly well-spent . parker wants us to feel for them , while i suspect wilde is more interested in making them look a bit foolish . playing the characters with too much sincerity may be too "" heavy "" a reading of the material . fortunately , parker still has plenty of juicy wilde-ian dialogue to distribute . many actors have opted to play wilde with an eyebrow arched into the flight path passenger jets , as though we all must know they view life itself as a grand joke . everett smartly opts for a refined weariness , the cynicism of a man who doesn't take much pleasure in his cynicism . it's a choice that makes his later romance with mabel ( played with beautiful intelligence by driver ) feel less like a plot device than it has any right to . it's true that a little droll can go an awfully long way , and that an ideal husband hardly offers a riveting portrait of scandal and redemption . mostly it's a comedy of manners , one of wilde's forrays into the difference between our public and private faces ( a subject with which he was well acquainted ) . though parker's pacing lags between gags , there is just enough surprisingly modern satire -- and just enough rupert everett -- to maintain interest . the chuckles may rarely turn into belly laughs , but then again , that never was wilde's style . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1482,"in my review of john sayles' 1996 film lone star , i wrote that my initial frustration with the film must have meant that i missed something . such was my confidence in sayles' storytelling that i was convinced i could find the unifying thematic thread if i just pondered long enough . in that particular case , i was right . sayles' new film limbo presented me with the same initial frustration , and the same determination to find the one piece that would turn the merely intriguing into the truly brilliant . and it just wasn't there . for the first hour , there are plenty of reasons to believe limbo could be the latest thematically rich cinematic sayles novel . here , alaska has at least two faces : the raw , blank-slate wilderness that provides escape and opportunity for new beginnings , and the tourist attraction that provides a sanitized version of that wilderness . sayles offers plenty of local color with his supporting characters , but it's the way those characters interact with the place that gives limbo weight . for half the film , limbo sets a tentative romance against a backdrop of civilization trying to claim one of the few remaining frontiers , even as residents who should know better keep searching for a predictability that just isn't there . i suppose you could see the second half as sayles' attempt to show just how far civilization has to go , if you were feeling particularly generous . even worse , the links to the first half's portrait of alaska at a cultural crossroads become tenuous at best . the second half is solid enough , but it's a jarring shift . instead of a novel , sayles has written two short stories slammed together in an uncomfortable fit . john sayles' films are always comparative pleasures in the bigger picture of filmmaking , with their smart dialogue and attention to human detail . sayles has also become a more visually interesting director with every film , turning in at least one hypnotically beautiful sequence of joe returning to fishing ( another triumph for cinematographer haskell wexler ) . he can say fascinating things both with his dialogue and his camera . in limbo , all those fascinating things just don't add up to a fascinating , unified story . limbo isn't a disappointment because he doesn't say enough , as in the ambiguous final shot . it's a disappointment because he tries to say too much . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1484,"it's easy enough to adopt the head-shaking perspective that the muppets just ain't what they used to be . certainly the death of jim henson left a void in the muppet universe , but it's only fitting that the show has gone on .

[warning : the very nature of this review may involve plot spoilers for viewers who have not yet seen the film . ] of all the benefits i have received from being a film critic , i may value innocence the most . it may seem an odd choice of words in a profession more often associated with cynicism , but it applies nonetheless . while the onslaught of studio publicity is impossible to avoid completely , the ability to attend press screenings serves as something of a buffer against expectations . it was impossible for me to react to the blair witch hype since i had written my review six months before its release ; i never needed to guard against becoming aware of key crying game-esque plot points . it was possible for my viewing experience to remain relative untainted , subject only to pre-conceived notions for which i could have no one but myself to blame . it took the release of the sixth sense for me to realize how much that innocence can matter . reviews and discussions meticulously avoided revealing the specific nature of the ending , but by then the damage had been done . i considered everything i knew about the film , and made an educated guess regarding what would be revealed in its closing moments . then i finally caught up with the film , and watched with my "" can i out-guess the writer "" glasses on . within twenty minutes , it was obvious that i had guessed correctly . i'm not going to suggest that it was particularly clever of me to figure it out . i will suggest that i probably wouldn't have been testing my cleverness if i hadn't known there was something to be figured out . the simple knowledge that there was a plot point to be sussed out set me to sussing . and i spent as much of the film nodding to myself at the clues i recognized as i did trying to get caught up in the story . the nature of the film made such behavior both a blessing and a curse . writer/director m . night shyamalan's pacing is so agonizingly deliberate that i was delighted to have something else on which to train my attention . conversely , i was able to give bruce willis's monotonous performance a bit more benefit of the doubt , and admire the craft which allowed shyamalan's little trick to seem plausible . the only constant to draw me from my reverie was osment , a sublimely effective child actor whose performance alone is enough to recommend the sixth sense . children in jeopardy are usually a narrative cheat , but osment's reactions to his situation are always more compelling than shyamalan's few moments of thriller gimmickry . the irony is that my connection with cole's plight was consistently undercut by my awareness that the film's payoff would focus on someone else . perhaps my long-standing aversion to physician-heal-thyself psychologist/psychiatrist characters ( coincidentally sparked by another willis film , the ghastly color of night ) turned me off to malcolm as an equal player in the story . perhaps the supernaturally comforting closing shot reminded me too much of ghost . or perhaps i never bought the entire arc of malcolm's story from the outset . it's hard for me to know whether it was the film itself or my constant view of its wires which left me unimpressed . the success of the sixth sense suggests that it has struck an emotional chord in many viewers . for me , the only chords it could strike were technical . there was a not-particularly-inspired gag often used by titanic detractors during its theatrical run , something along the lines of "" what's the point , you know the boat's going to sink . "" most of the time , it's even true . next time , i hope i don't go into a film knowing whether or not the boat is going to sink . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1490,"yes , it's true -- stir of echoes features a child who sees dead people . it includes in its metaphysics the notion that disgruntled spirits cause chilly temperatures in the human world . it is at least partially a tale of a wrongful death made right . depending on where you fall in the old glass half-full/half-empty argument , stir of echoes is the beneficiary of either extraordinarily good timing or extraordinarily bad timing . maybe comparisons with mega-success the sixth sense will doom it to obscurity . or maybe a spillover effect , with movie-goers still hungry for supernatural subject matter , will present it with an audience it might not otherwise have had . for my money , viewers can't go far wrong either way . if they go , they'll be moderately satisfied ; if they don't go , they won't be missing all that much . it's awfully easy to dwell on the similarities between stir of echoes and the sixth sense , weighing in simply with whether the former is better or worse than the latter . it would be easier to ignore those similarities if the whole film didn't feel overly familiar . that doesn't change the way stir of echoes is likely to be viewed today : a mish-mash of familiar elements . that's not to say that stir of echoes isn't also a reasonably effective thriller in its own conventional way . david koepp , who helmed the unsettling and little-seen trigger effect , has a knack for crafting a scene that gets under your skin without resorting to too many shock cuts . he also draws nice work from a solid cast , particularly erbe adding a few shadings to the thankless wife role . koepp's direction may get a little showy -- jittery time-lapse shots of ghosts , funky business in the "" theater "" of tom's hypnotic trance -- but it does its job manufacturing the creeps . it ain't deep , but it's scary enough . unfortunately for stir of echoes , it's less effective than it could be because koepp seems to think it _is_ deep . the subtext of joe six-pack tom seeing his new gift as a shot at finally doing something extraordinary comes and goes , and it's hard to see anything voluntary in his character arc . bacon's performance suffers from this erratic motivation -- he's reasonably convincing both in his terror and in his determination , but the two never come together . by the time koepp trots out an extended flashback of a crime in progress , his melodrama has bogged down the chills . ironically , that's yet another way stir of echoes is like the sixth sense : it's a moderately clever genre diversion that wants us to believe it's something more . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1491,"screenplay : david o . russell . director : david o . russell . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 111 minutes . it was all night-vision and smart-bombs , desert shields and protections of sovereignty -- a just war waged against a power-mad dictator . there's more than a little irony to the fact that three kings is just as visually striking as the gulf war , and nearly as shaky in its substance . sgt . special forces capt . archie gates ( george clooney ) also learns of the map , but believes there's far more to be had than cell phones and rolexes -- specifically , bunkers filled with millions in gold bullion . as a moderately revisionist history lesson , there's no question that three kings both engages and enlightens . provocative moral dilemmas abound in three kings , which should be the stuff of compelling drama . somehow , it just isn't . the messages are similar to those familiar from anti-war films like paths of glory , m * a * s * h and platoon -- war is even more hellish when policy has little to do with humanity -- yet the characters are not nearly as strong . he can also create plenty of urgency with his stylistic flourishes , of which plenty abound . three kings is a genuinely eye-catching piece of work in which russell makes bold choices to drive home a point , from the graphic internal images of a wounded body to the slow-motion punctuation of bullet wounds as video game warfare tears through real flesh . unfortunately , the same impulse to drive a point home leads to scenes in which a scene described in dialogue is simultaneously portrayed on screen . in retrospect , i'm not sure why i still admired three kings as much as i did . it's certainly an unconventional film , zig-zagging between dark comedy and raw drama with surprising effectiveness . every once in a while , russell will do one of those little things that remind you how invigorating cinema can be . there's just not enough to shake the sense that three kings is too enamored of its sense of historical importance . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1492,"screenplay : ed stone , phil reeves and mark illsley . director : mark illsley . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity ) running time : 98 minutes . it is entirely likely that few viewers will think of happy , texas as an instantly dated comedy . they'll laugh along with the broad humor , letting the premise take them along on all its wacky misunderstandings and complications . they'll roar like the audience member in front of me at the incongruous situations . and while there are plenty of things that are worth a chuckle in happy , texas , there is this one glaring issue that made it impossible for me to surrender completely to its zaniness . you see , in happy , texas , homosexuality itself is the punch line . it's a superbly cast feature-length episode of "" three's company . "" naturally , harry and wayne's role-playing leads to confusion and awkward moments . some of those moments are indeed very funny , particularly wayne's spastic first attempts at choreography and his brusque manner with the children ; others are ridiculously trite , like the number of occasions in which harry and wayne are caught in what appears to others to be a tender moment . when the film builds towards a will-they-or-won't-they involving harry and jo , the more appropriate question given the slapdash efforts at building harry's character arc , is why-should-we-care . the reason nothing has any resonance , or even much humanity to the belly laughs , is that happy , texas seems entirely content to be a sit-com . instead , you can feel the audience responding giddily to the mere idea of one man touching another , to the sight of a gay bar , to chappy and harry slow dancing . the wonderfully talented macy invests chappy with far more warmth and dignity than the character deserves , but there's something disconcerting about the whole enterprise . i was left watching a fish-out-of-water comedy in which the land animals weren't in on the jokes at the fishes' expense . at least by that point the film has surrendered to its lowbrow sensibilities , making for a raucous comedy with little subtlety . the talent in the cast keeps sparking happy , texas to comic high notes -- macy , as already noted , is utterly charming ; zahn is a delightfully high-strung and bug-eyed -- yet those notes rarely blend into a happy tune . i can't imagine the film played that way on the page with this many gifted actors interested , but happy , texas offers the same situations john ritter turned into laugh-track gold 20 years ago . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1493,"screenplay : alan zweibel and jessie nelson . director : rob reiner . it is a wonderfully affecting moment , beautifully performed by pfeiffer with all the love and frustration that makes up a marriage . it's also a moment that is a complete cheat . theoretically , the story of us is the story of how easy it is , in the middle of all the white noise and tension of everyday life , to lose track of why you fell in love with someone in the first place . unfortunately , it's such a fragmented narrative that it's just as easy for the _audience_ to lose track of why they fell in love in the first place . the script by alan zweibel and jessie nelson sprinkles flashbacks through the summer of the jordan's separation -- a peek at their meeting and first date here , an interrupted dalliance on the butcher block there -- but there aren't nearly enough of them . the story of us spends virtually all its time showing us the relationship already in trouble , making it incredibly difficult to appreciate what made the relationship good in the first place . we're asked to invest ourselves emotionally in the success or failure of the jordans' marriage without getting enough evidence that it should succeed . it's even more frustrating to realize that the story of us is so solid at its core that it could have been wonderful . the film is not always a pleasant experience , showing off some extremely unfair fighting between its protagonists and the wrenching moments when emotional damage seems beyond repair . willis and pfeiffer deftly turn their post-separation scenes into awkward shuffles between longing and despair ; where most films treat divorce either as all-acrimony or all-indifference , this one captures how much people want it all to work out . but at only 92 minutes , the story of us feels bereft of context . somewhere on the cutting room floor is the arc of a relationshp from affection to simple coexistence to a blur of petty bickering . if only more of the so-called humor had found its way to the same floor . wilson rants about how men never change the toilet paper roll , a gag that hasn't gotten any fresher since it was generated by bad stand-up comics 20 years ago . reiner waxes philosophical about how "" there is no ass , just the fleshy tops of your legs . "" reiser spends five minutes degrading an idea for a book about ben's grandparents , inspiring only stony silence from the audience . reiner and his writers keep trying so hard to lighten the mood they only end up breaking it , with little to show for their efforts but a few half-hearted chuckles . it's easy to see the comedy as part of reiner's attempt to create a companion piece to his 1989 gem when harry met sally . with its direct addresses to the camera and hairdo-change time lapses , the story of us does sometimes feel like when harry left sally . yet while this film was unlikely to be as purely entertaining , it could have been far more resonant . some of the individual scenes in the story of us are heartbreaking , and a few are truly charming . they just never quite add up to the story of them in a way that provides real catharsis . it's easy to understand why those snippets would move katie to tears ; after all , she lived those moments . the story of us could have moved us all if only we'd been allowed to live them , too . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1494,"director : martin scorsese . if the opening minutes of bringing out the dead start to look very familiar , you're not alone -- even martin scorsese agrees with you . "" there's a correlation to taxi driver , there's no doubt , "" scorsese comments in the press notes , which admission can only inspire a sarcastic , "" no , really ? "" for a while , you suspect the film should be called ambulance driver . scorsese ultimately takes bringing out the dead somewhere quite different , which is both a blessing and a disappointment . much of the film is spent on the day-to-day -- or , in this case , night-to-night -- life of the paramedics , and on that level it's often fascinating and brutally hilarious . even the trips into the our lady of perpetual mercy emergency room -- a barely-controlled bedlam that would send even the "" er "" cast screaming for the hills -- pound home the nightmare of the job . when scorsese and cinematographer robert richardson keep their eyes trained on the kinetic , frenetic world of pierce and his cohorts , bringing out the dead has the darkly comic vibe of m * a * s * h , providing entertaining ( if occasionally unnerving ) insight into a violent world where the only sane response is to go a little insane . there is , however , a backbone to this story , if not an exceptionally strong one . cage delivers a performance that is alternately wild-eyed and catatonic , a frustrating pastiche of previous cage roles instead of a distinct character of its own . scorsese and schrader really miss the mark in the film's final minutes , when frank's epiphany becomes a depressingly obvious combination of glinda-the-good-witch dialogue and purifying white light . it's all well and good that scorsese and shrader claim they've "" a little mellower now , "" and that 25 years after taxi driver they've opted for something a bit less bleakly pessimistic . there's plenty of visual gusto to bringing out the dead , and there are plenty of wildly entertaining episodes to keep you watching . it's just hard not to wish for a personality half as intensely memorable as bickle to pull it all together . whenever frank's introspections take center stage , you need to keep rousing yourself to ask , "" are you talkin' to me ?

1495,"director : jon turtletaub . you'd think disney could mail it in by now . "" underdog makes good "" comedies have been a staple of the studio's live-action repertoire from the absent-minded professor to gus to the mighty ducks . that a significant portion of their audience wouldn't notice if they * did * mail it in makes it all the more impressive that they don't . cool runnings carries on a tradition of formula comedies exuding good-natured energy , and entertaining more than they have any right to . anyone who has ever seen a disney sports film , or almost any sports film for that matter , can tell you more or less exactly what to expect . there will be a hissable , cartoonish villain who questions our heroes' mettle ( do you think he'll get his comeuppance ? ) . no one goes to these films to be overwhelmed by the originality of the story . it's all about positive feeling , and cool runnings delivers it . the slapstick training runs are lively , enough so that the youngsters in my audience were screaming with delight . the bobsled footage is superb , and the olympic village atmosphere is exciting . jamaica is disney-fied into an idealized , colorful paradise replete with grinning waifs and free of most signs of poverty , but it's brightly filmed and after all , this isn't a film which offers much in the way of social commentary . leon is a bit stiff but still appealing as the determined team leader . malik yuba glowers and grumbles effectively as yul , and rawle e . lewis' junior is jittery and expressive . doug e . doug gets the comic relief role as sanka , and proves to be a winning presence . in the past , candy's name in the credits has been almost as sure a sign of a comedy i'll hate as mickey rourke's has been of a drama i'll hate . here candy plays the straight man instead of the buffoon , and plays it well . it doesn't take much imagination to buy candy as a has-been * anything * , but he's more than just serviceable . he plays blitzer surprisingly understated , even when giving the obligatory inspirational speeches , and allows the rest of the cast to carry most of the comedy . i could spend plenty of time nitpicking about what cool runnings didn't do , or should have done . the real story behind the formation of the team is far less "" hollywood , "" and that's not the only historical fact with which the film plays fast and loose . but for my money , the most important factor was that i left the theater smiling and feeling uplifted . it's a film about success coming from hard work and determination , and it's a film i would be glad to take a family to see . that's a rarity , and it's worth praise on its own level .

1496,"screenplay : neil gaiman , adapted from the screenplay by hayao miyazaki . director : hayao miyazaki . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 136 minutes . somehow , somewhere , this whole "" anime "" wave has left me behind . sure , the japanese animation style is distinctive , but it strikes me that the form has not progressed radically in the 30 years since "" speed racer . "" though the backgrounds may have become richer , there's still a vaguely anglicized blandness to the character design , a strange lack of fluidity to the acrobatic movements . when the japanese smash princess mononoke made its way to our shores , it was spoken of as the future of animation . i was skeptical that it would bring anything that wasn't already the past of anime . from an animation standpoint , i still think that's true , though princess mononoke does have some striking imagery . the real revelation in the film is the depth and complexity of its mythology and storytelling , which manage to overcome the problems with the human story . in case there is any confusion on the subject , let's be clear that princess mononoke is a film for adults . it also maintains an adult tone in the set-up of its mystical world , with gods who can be petulant , violent and even just plain stupid ( a cosmology far more in keeping with most ancient civilizations' mythologies than disney's benign pantheisms ) . most impressive , miyazaki keeps his story free of the didacticism so common in films with environmental themes . rare is the tale that suggests industry could be a co-existing entity in nature , rather than an inherent evil . princess mononoke is so engrossing as both legend and lesson that you wish it could treat its characters with more care . the line readings by the english actors are flat and constricted , performances set to a stopwatch of mouth movements instead of to the needs of the scene . and then there's the dialogue , which generally ranges from the annoyingly literalist ( characters seem incapable of looking at a thing without calling out its name ) to the purely giggle-inducing ( i don't believe i'll ever embrace unreservedly a film that includes the line , "" forest spirit , we give you back your head "" ) . princess mononoke at times appears to be an animated variation on this year's more ballyhooed version of mythopoetics over substance , the phantom menace . still , there is something compelling about the look of princess mononoke , more so than i was expecting . the design of the supernatural characters is always intriguing , from the writhing worm-bodies of the demons to the pillsbury doughboy-cum-tiki-idol sprites called the kodamas ; the battlefields are arresting in their gore-spattered silence . indeed , silence plays an unexpectedly effective role in this epic film , giving it a sense of reverence . there's just the problem of those darned people , whose homogeneity in word and countenance hinders an otherwise stellar effort . anime may be more or less what it used to be , but at least the storytelling behind it is growing up . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1497,"starring : jeremy irons , john lone . director : david cronenberg . i approached the film version of m . butterfly with something of a "" show me "" attitude . i'd had the good fortune to see a sensational production of the play by northern california's theatreworks company , with an amazing lead performance by mark capri as gallimard , and i felt that any other version would have to be pretty good to impress me . i also questioned the choice of david cronenberg , whose previous efforts had all been horror films , as director . it therefore comes as a pleasant surprise that cronenberg's m . butterfly maintains a real faithfulness to the basic themes of david henry hwang's tony award-winning play , although it loses a great deal from the absence of the stage version's brechtian devices . it's useless to argue that the story is implausible , based as it is on a real event ; m . butterfly is itself an attempt to explain how it could have happened . hwang's conclusion is that the boursicot/gallimard story is inextricably tied to the perception westerners hold of the east , that of a culture of subservience . consequently , they think of all asians as feminized , making gallimard's assumption of song's gender purely cultural . hwang and cronenberg convey that sense of western sexual/political arrogance in lines which draw knowing chuckles , such as gallimard's assurance to his superior that the vietnamese would "" submit to any show of strength "" by the americans . it's an interesting theme well-explored . where i felt m . butterfly was less successful was in portraying the complexities of gallimard's character . in the play , he speaks directly to the audience , a device which allows for some ironic observations of his state of mind . the film's more conventional narrative approach makes gallimard less pathetic than he should be . without this aspect of his personality evident , his vulnerability to the deception doesn't make as much sense . there should be a clear sense that psychologically , he * needs * song to be a woman , and it's not quite there . such an emphasis on gallimard's psychology would also have gone far toward making john lone a credible choice as song . lone's voice has an eerie , detached quality which i liked for its mysterious allure , but the fact is that he just looks too masculine , and an eight foot high close-up doesn't exactly promote illusion . irons is a much better choice as gallimard . m . butterfly is a fascinating story , and its screen telling is more than fair to the stage spirit . i only wish hwang had been allowed to keep the focus on the internal . it's a good film that could have been a very good one .

1498,"screenplay : david o'malley . director : carl reiner . never underestimate the power of expectations . in the wake of hot shots ! part deux , loaded weapon 1 and robin hood : men in tights , i viewed yet another genre parody as cruel and inhuman punishment , and awaited fatal instinct with utter dread . then , much to my astonishment , it didn't stink . oh , make no mistake : fatal instinct isn't particularly good . i simply laughed much more than i expected to . how's that for damning with faint praise ? the "" plot "" of fatal instinct is a pastiche of elements from contemporary sexual thrillers and classic film noir . the naked gun ) demonstrated sucessful application of a fundamental rule for the form : keep the gags coming so fast that you don't have time to notice the lousy ones . fatal instinct owes its successes , small as they may be , to adherence to this principal . there are plenty of duds in fatal instinct , but the pacing is lively enough that they don't sit there waiting for an audience reaction that's never going to come . director carl reiner hasn't shown a consistent talent for comic pacing in his feature film career ; for every where's poppa ? or all of me , there has been a summer school or sibling rivalry . fortunately , the carl reiner who helped steve martin's early parodies click is at work here . he keeps everything moving , avoiding the error that sank men in tights . those zaz classics had one other important thing going for them , namely well-known dramatic actors like leslie nielsen and lloyd bridges playing a brilliant deadpan mockery of their own b-movie roles . armand assante is a better dramatic actor than nielsen or bridges , but he too turns in a fine spoof of one of the lowlights on his resume , the dopey mike hammer tale i , the jury . he seems to have a great deal of fun mocking the image of the sullen detective , and pulls off some surprisingly deft physical comedy . perhaps half my enjoyment of fatal instinct came from appreciating the career subtext of these two performances . before it seems as though i have nothing but kind words for fatal instinct , there is one major thing lacking : originality . its primary satirical targets are basic instinct , fatal attraction and cape fear , each of which has been done in other recent films or tv's "" the simpsons . "" granted , the scripts were in production simultaneously , but much of the freshness is still lost . there are also some tedious "" lotsies , "" those sequences of progressively sillier events a la o . j . simpson's ill-fated boat investigation at the beginning of the naked gun . there was a moment near the climax when i was waiting for an almost too-obvious gag which * still * would have been funny , but screenwriter david o'malley missed his opportunity . in retrospect , i almost feel guilty about some of the places i laughed . it's hard to explain how a line like , "" i'll try to help you , miss cain , if i'm able , "" can seem funny , but it did . i don't know ; maybe they were expecting too much .

1499,"mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 183 minutes . in a way , you've got to admire frank darabont's chutzpah . another stephen king period piece adaptation . as if a successful rookie director didn't face enough of a challenge from high expectations , darabont practically threw audiences and critics a dare : "" go ahead -- say 'it's no shawshank . ' "" his incredibly nervy choice almost works . . . almost . you're sure to see plenty of gripes about the green mile that focus on its three-hour-plus running time . it's a common and understandable complaint in a year when 150+ minute running times are becoming standard in "" prestige films . "" however , the problem with the green mile isn't simply that it's long , but the way that it is long . darabont's meticulous attention to relating every event in the novel borders on fetishistic , including encounters ( like the one that permits a reunion between hanks and gump cast-mate gary sinise ) that serve too little narrative purpose . the green mile is never a bore during its three hours ; indeed , it consistently keeps you watching . this just isn't a story that builds to anything compelling enough to warrant such epic length . darabont's adaptation doesn't show enough screenwriting creativity in transferring the story to a cinematic context . too often , it feels like a methodical transcription . darabont does have a way with actors , and that carries the green mile a long way . michael clarke duncan is a shy and sympathetic coffey , his occasional moments of childlike wonder an effective balance against his moments of anguish . and any film with bonnie hunt is doing something right . in the shawshank redemption , the soulfulness of morgan freeman's performance grounded the film whenever darabont got too operatic . that quality is missing from hanks . though his character also isn't as complex as red , his performance at times feels too mannered . i kept imagining david morse -- who plays edgecombe's right-hand man "" brutal "" howell -- in the lead role , and suspecting the green mile would have been a better film with morse's dramatic presence . watching hanks emoting with a sothern accent just kept reminding me of forrest gump . with edgecombe serving as a less-than-engrossing narrator , it's too easy to notice the aforementioned operatic qualities : tearful goodbyes , battles between good and evil , more exploding light bulbs than i've seen since the natural . there is no denying that the green mile is a well-crafted film , and that coffey becomes an extremely affecting character . it just takes a long time to get there , a long time that could have been shortened in a more efficient screenplay . darabont is a talented director , and a pretty good writer . he's also earned the right to be less slavishly devoted to his source material . while we wait for his next effort -- and i don't think there are any more stephen king prison stories sitting around waiting to be made -- we can only applaud him for taking a unique risk . and we can say , with a tinge of regret , "" it's no shawshank .

1500,"screenplay : john hamilton and david reckziegel . the subject of the experiment : male attitudes about women , sex and relationships . without the star power , but that wouldn't be entirely fair to this canadian battle-of-the-sexes comedy . true , it covers some familiar territory in the realm of contemporary sexual politics , but it adds enough twists and fresh characters to stay interesting . more to the point , he's someone who thinks he's figured out everyone else but doesn't have the first clue about himself . dinsmore does a fine job with jimmy , combining charm , arrogance , intelligence and uncertainty into a coherent character . the scenes with his male friends rang somewhat false , thanks largely to a performance by burke lawrence that begins and ends as a swaggering caricature . fortunately , these scenes are infrequent and less critical , allowing dinsmore to shine where he's needed most . the larger flaw in myth is an excessively stagy quality , as though it had been intended originally as a play . many scenes , particularly those involving the conversations between jimmy and jane , are a bit claustrophobic , and even the lighting design suggests stage roots . the script often lays it on rather thick , using speeches to get points across with little subtlety , sometimes the same point more than once . but to its credit , the myth of the male orgasm plays fair with both sexes' attitudes , avoiding a "" women good , men bad "" level of simplicity . both jimmy and jane learn something , and the film's most appealing message may be the need to get past assumptions and generalizations in the formation of honest relationships . the broad , theatrical acting styles and blatant politics may not be for every taste , but i found the myth of the male orgasm to be a clever and occasionally insightful take on the collision of changing roles with centuries-old perceptions .

1501,"screenplay : amy schor & vicki polon . director : anthony minghella . sometimes , it's all about state of mind . either you're ready to enjoy a certain kind of movie , or you're not . i can envision a different set of circumstances under which i might have walked away from mr . wonderful with eyes rolling and a groan of "" puh-leez . "" but i didn't . instead , i found it to be a warm and charming lightweight romance , full of appealing performances and well-directed moments of tiny heartbreak . nothing about that premise screams originality . feuding exes who still carry a torch have been fodder for most daytime and nighttime soaps for ever . the relative success of mr . wonderful is attributable almost entirely to the cast . dillon is an extremely likable lug ; sciorra has the tense charm of a woman just discovering herself . their scenes together work to perfection because they manage to be thoroughly convincing as two people who have know each other , as lee notes , "" practically since i was born . "" they shift naturally between civil conversation and petty bickering , creating a genuine sense of history between them , and it's extremely entertaining to watch . it was the frequency of moments like that one which ultimately won me over to caring about these characters . parker has one of the most expressive mouths in films , and she uses it to show more different shades of emotion than she has lines . i also enjoyed david barry gray , who has an endearing puppy-dog energy about him as gus's best friend pope . this is not to say that all of the characters worked all the time . vincent d'onofrio only gets three scenes to develop what ends up being a rather important character , and consequently seems to try a bit too hard to make dominic angelic . and yes , dillon does have some overplayed moments , making gus's "" hidden emotions "" far too obvious for anyone with half a brain , or even a notochord . director anthony minghella , who gave us the low-key supernatural romance truly , madly , deeply , seems to have a knack for finding slices of real emotion without resorting to schmaltz . i was genuinely touched by a small moment involving a woman waiting for a blind date from a personals ad , as well as a brief conversation between rita and lee . however , these same moments also made me wonder whether mr . wonderful had missed an opportunity to be a more wide-ranging examination of everyone's search for a mr . or mr . wonderful , and what people are willing to do or give up for that chance . as it stands , the focus on the specific still held my attention . mr . wonderful is no work of art , but it's gentle and affirming and it caught me on a good day . kindly check in your cynicism at the door .

1502,"screenplay : john logan and oliver stone . director : oliver stone . in any given sunday , oliver stone may have found the ideal subject for his unique brand of cinematic storytelling . coaches send in the x's and o's , but it's the kinetic fury of what goes on in the huddle and at the line of scrimmage that comes alive . if any given sunday had stayed on the field , focused on the intensity of games , it might have been a classic sports movie . stone , however , has bigger issues on his mind -- as he inevitably , agonizingly always seems to . he wants to do all this despite the fact that he has too much ground to cover to give any of his themes more than a superficial gloss . it's not enough in 1999 to intone breathlessly that pro sports is corrupted and corrupting . you must be prepared to tell a human story that feels human . he's a director who just can't help underlining everything he puts on screen so the themes are tattooed on our foreheads . will be showing ben-hur in the background . when characters are feuding , there are shots of gathering storm clouds . any time any given sunday is focused on the lives of its characters off the field , you keep hoping for an opportunity to discover something real about them . stone , unfortunately , keeps steamrolling forward with split-second edits and changes in film stock , never offering a viewer the chance to contemplate what the story is about . stone's message : it's about exactly what i'm gonna tell you it's about , and i'm gonna tell you over and over and over again . all this is true , yet there are still those masterful game sequences . for stone , the '90s have been all about experimentations in multimedia assault . any given sunday takes a game that feels almost languid in its pacing on television and shows us the cranked-up energy of all the participants . coaches make frantic sideline adjustments , and players look for an opponent's slightest giveaway of his intentions . >from the you-are-there field level camera work to the twists on predictable sports movie heroics , stone plants you inside the game . and that's the only time he shows much interest in getting inside anything . any given sunday is stone's grandiose attempt to make football a metaphor for all of human existence , when he could have settled for a perfectly splendid film about football as a metaphor for football . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1503,"director : alan parker . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , brief nudity , sexual situations ) running time : 145 minutes . i have not read the much-loved memoir by frank mccourt on which angela's ashes is based , but every indication is that the film re-creates mccourt's limerick of the 1930s and 1940s magnificently . it's a life of almost inhuman squalor , compounded by the effects of unemployment and alcoholism . it's the kind of life you might not believe existed if someone hadn't committed his life story to the page . as a snapshot of existence in this particular time and place , alan parker's adaptation of angela's ashes is exemplary . as a compelling story , it's not half as effective . things are not much better there , as malachy is rarely able to find work , and drinks what little money he manages to earn . biographical stories can be tricky to pull off dramatically , since it's easy to portray them as a series of stand-alone episodes rather than part of a thematically consistent story . that's the problem that plagues angela's ashes in parker's attempt to maintain the integrity of mccourt's tales . this is a film composed almost entirely of vignettes : frank's first communion , frank's work on the coal heap , frank's visit with some classmates to see his first naked girls , etc . some of them amuse , and some of them are touching , but few of them resonate the way it seems they should . instead , it plays as just one more vignette in a life of first communion , work on the coal heap and seeing naked girls . the one place angela's ashes does resonate -- if all too briefly -- is in the portrayal of frank's father . carlyle's performance , combining a strange pride and sincere intentions with a pathetic sickness of the soul , is one of the best things about angela's ashes ( emily watson , by comparison , has little to do but smoke and look determined ) . the wrenching moments in which malachy disappoints his family -- particularly when frank tries to balance his disappointment with his love for his father -- give the film its emotional weight . when malachy leaves the narrative , it never quite has as much to say . i can imagine that device giving his experiences more immediacy , something to sustain the story beyond mere sympathy for young frank's plight . as a film , angela's ashes works mostly as a period record , with production designer geoffrey kirkland , costume designer consolata boyle and cinematographer michael seresin working their technical magic on a somber , straightforward script . too much of it is admirable without necessarily being engaging , serving as a mere litany of childhood miseries . without the father/son angle that had served the film so well , angela's ashes drifts into two and a half hours of variations on a grim , grimy theme . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1504,"after the smash romantic thriller ghost and the suspense mystery jacob's ladder , rubin had already staked his claim to status as master of metaphysical melodrama . now comes his feature directorial debut , my life , which again ventures into issues of life and death . the results are extremely mixed . when my life scores , it scores big ; when it misses , it misses big . to his credit , rubin avoids the glycerine-soaked excesses that plagued ghost . this isn't a big-screen version of a "" disease of the week "" tv-movie ; it's a contemplative , almost spiritual story buoyed by the small but crucial role of the healer played by haing s . ngor . ngor projects a serenity which permeates the film , the effect of his splendid scenes with keaton lingering long after the scenes themself end . in fact , my life may be surprisingly over-subtle when it requires a moment of real catharsis . too much of bob's struggle is kept beneath the surface , and as a result i was left with a truckload of questions about who bob jones really was . by far , the best thing about my life is michael keaton . those who remember his impressive performance in clean and sober know that keaton can be a fine dramatic actor when he has good material , and my life provides him with some fine moments . the best are those which play to his cocky comic sensibility . there is real charm to the scenes of bob's videotaped instructions to his yet-to-be-born son on such vital issues as shaving , basketball and entering a room . when it comes to the more serious elements , keaton doesn't have as much to work with . my life is supposed to be about a change in bob jones' life , but we don't get a clear enough picture of who he was before his illness to make it evident that there has been a change . rubin ignores the basic dramatic rule of "" show , don't tell "" by having another character say that bob "" isn't exactly an example of an examined life . "" that's a quality i just don't feel i * saw * . my life also caught me just as i had reached my breaking point in terms of tolerating saintly cinematic wives/girlfriends with no discernible personalities of their own . nicole kidman's gail is a complete blank , spending far too much of the time radiating dangerously high levels of understanding . i was left completely untouched by the crucial love story because i never believed that there were two human beings involved . instead , i saw one human being and one porcelain figurine with lots of hair . kidman's one genuine moment , a very funny line in the middle of gail's labor pains , was shocking because it was the first time gail seemed to be made of flesh . the fact that it's bob's story doesn't mean that gail can't be well-written , and she is not . in spite of my distaste for the love story , i was ready to be far more positive in my recommendation of my life until its final fifteen minutes . after a solid opening , alternately entertaining and introspective , my life just peters out . bruce joel rubin the auteur didn't have enough other people pushing him to flesh out his characters or fill in the holes in an otherwise affecting story .

1505,"screenplay : david howard and robert gordon . mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , violence ) running time : 102 minutes . i can say without reservation that galaxy quest boasts the best mainstream "" high concept "" of 1999 . i started chuckling the moment i heard about a film in which the cast members of a beloved television science-fiction series -- a decade removed from any career except appearing at conventions and ribbon-cuttings -- were mistaken by an alien race for real fighters for interplanetary justice . i saw it as a wonderful opportunity both to needle the phenomenon of "" star trek "" fandom and to embrace its fundamental optimism . if handled properly , it could be a fun and funny adventure into the way our popular entertainments can help define our world , and define the performers who create them . i was so engaged by the concept of galaxy quest that , even as the film was unfolding , i kept cutting it slack . it's also something of a missed opportunity ( or , more specifically , a series of missed opportunities ) . screenwriters david howard and robert gordon drop in plenty of goodies for those in the "" star trek "" know , yet they're often more content to rely on insider gags than to flesh those gags out . a story with the potential to focus on how the actors come to terms with their legacy ultimately becomes just another comic adventure , less about the people than about the premise . oh , but that premise does make for some entertaining viewing . most of the best jokes showcase an internal logic that should be the envy of every science-fiction film : because the thermians designed the real ship after the television ship , it follows all of the show's rules . though the humor does tend towards the "" insider , "" at least it's insider in a generally clever way , finding amusement even in the captain's tendency to lose his shirt during every fight scene . galaxy quest is far too lively and good-natured to deserve harsh criticism ; in a season full of prestige-hungry oscar wannabes , it's nice to see a film interested primarily in putting a smile on your face . the smiles , unfortunately , don't turn into full-fledged laughs often enough . the situations beg to have the absurdity level turned up just a notch ; the characters beg to be given more personality . "" high concept "" is most often used by critics as a derogatory term , but that didn't have to be the case for galaxy quest . though it may send you out of the theater chuckling , it could have taken its concept even higher . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1506,"disney has been responsible for plenty of icons of childhood over the past 60 years , but if my son's wardrobe and stuffed animal collection are any indication , no libretto has been kinder to uncle walt's place over the years than the works of a . a . milne . kids adore these characters beyond measure , as befits characters based on a real child's own beloved playthings . the tigger movie is by no stretch of the imagination an embarrassing chapter in disney's relationship with the pooh gang ; indeed , it's light and generally pleasant . it just seems a shame for these characters to be wasted on filler between disney's _real_ animated films . the talent involved in the creation of the tigger movie offered plenty of hope that it could be plenty entertaining . many longtime voice participants in the pooh universe , including original piglet john fiedler , lend their gifts to the story , providing a sense of continuity from earlier stories . even more promising was the participation of veteran disney songwriters richard and robert sherman , the legendary brother tandem behind hummable hits like "" the bear necessities , "" "" everybody wants to be a cat , "" "" supercalifragilisticexpialidocious "" and even the original "" the wonderful thing about tiggers . "" this was not the sort of interest you'd expect to find in a cheap knock-off . and the tigger movie isn't a cheap knock-off . it just never feels particularly inspired , or particularly true to milne's amiable tales . yet that's the sort of lesson-mongering one would never associate with pooh and company . one also wouldn't expect a story that needed to be spiced up with a climactic avalanche to give it a sense of drama . one certainly wouldn't expect that the shermans' song contributions would be such a lackluster lot , with even the most obvious effort to create a catchy standard -- the pop culture-filled production number "" round my family tree "" -- falling short . for a disney film , it sure feels a lot more like one of the more half-hearted attempts to mimic a disney film . in all fairness , it should be clear that the tigger movie seemed to delight it's target audience of kindergarteners . there are even some enjoyable moments to delight those of us who are slightly older kids , including the perfectly pitched pessimism of eeyore ( peter cullen ) and tigger's colorful way with a malaprop . it's a cute film in its way , but there are those of us who expect more from disney when some of its most beloved characters are plopped into a new film . the bar is set a little bit higher , because it's too easy to fall back on the audience's good will towards those characters without insuring the vehicle is as tuneful , playful and easy-going as pooh-bear himself . the tigger movie isn't bad . it just doesn't feel particularly deserving of its stars . call me a sentimentalist , but i like to think of pooh as more than just a marketable brand-name . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1507,"i mean no disrespect to the burgeoning bhutanese film industry when i suggest that being selected as the bhutanese representative for the best foreign language film oscar doesn't automatically qualify as an impressive achievement . it's understandable that the cup would warrant some unique attention on this basis . the question is whether anyone would be paying much attention to the cup if it didn't happen to offer a unique cultural perspective . it's always tough to say , but i'm guessing not . there are certainly some charms in this fact-based bit of whimsy , set in 1998 at a tibetan buddhist monastery-in-exile . there's no denying that the cup may be worth seeing simply for its sociology lesson . american films with tibetan buddhist themes -- seven years in tibet and kundun -- have often seemed to be so concerned with telling the story of an important political issue that the personal side has been lost . it is certainly refreshing to see a story in which tibetan people are seen as people , and not merely as martyrs . and then one moves past that humanizing appeal , and doesn't find a whole lot more . writer/director khyentse norbu understands his people , but he has a lot to learn about structuring a narrative . even at only 93 minutes , the cup drags along towards the monks' eventual efforts to gather enough money to rent the television and satellite dish , then try to get the whole apparatus working . it's worth a few chuckles to see the monks trying to navigate the technology ; it's considerably less entertaining watching the film meander , dabbling in the crowd-pleasing qualities of shadow puppets and a sort of "" gift of the magi "" sub-plot involving orgyen and a younger monk's beloved keepsake . the pacing of the cup may be perfectly representative of the culture from which it originates , just as the story itself may be perfectly representative . i find myself leaning towards a recommendation simply because it showed me something i didn't know before , which is one of the reasons i love film in the first place . there's just not much substance to the cup worth getting enthusiastic over , unless the mere notion of tibetan monks playing pranks and watching soccer is enough of a hilarious incongruity to carry your viewing experience . the amateur cast and rookie director can't make the film soar on its own terms . or about making bhutan's first oscar contender . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1508,"wildly flawed though it may be , wonder boys has one thing going for it you just can't take away : a dead dog . call me a sick puppy if you must -- in a cinematic environment where you can litter a landscape with human corpses but god forbid the plucky pooch doesn't make it to the final reel intact , it's refreshing to find a film with the nerve to off fido . you learn something about a film-maker's willingness to take you somewhere different via these small touches , and they're the kind of small touches wonder boys sends spilling all over the screen . and so on . if there had been something more cohesive at the center of wonder boys , it could have been one of those minor classics of tics and quirks like the freshman . instead , it's a rambling , shambling , often endearing mess of a movie about a pittsburgh english professor named grady tripp ( michael douglas ) . the aforementioned oddball touches probably give you a good sense for wonder boys' unconventional tone , but the film's unconventionality actually goes a bit beyond that . confidential ) and screenwriter steve kloves ( awol from the big screen since flesh and bone in 1993 ) give the story a pacing that can best be described as unhurried . it's almost as though the filmmakers treat everything as though it's seen through the eyes of tripp , whose fondness for the ganja cannot be overstated . douglas , who has never been shy about taking on characters with an unpleasant side , gives a good-natured performance as a guy who becomes ever-more-dilapidated over the course of the film . all those moments in such a leisurely , unpretentious package should have added up to first-class fun , but somehow wonder boys never quite gets there . more to the point , it doesn't leave you with the impression that first-class fun was the object in the first place . suddenly you're left with the sensation that wonder boys was really about a 50-year-old adolescent just learning how to grow up , which leaves you wondering why development of tripp's character was so haphazzard . it's one thing to enjoy a casual story about the exploits of a casual character . it's a bit more frustrating when you realize something serious was supposed to come out of it . it's particularly frustrating when nothing about the first 90 minutes of the film suggests any of the characters were meant to be taken seriously . that's not to say it's not enjoyable to spend time with them ; downey , mcdormand and maguire all craft convincing characters . there's just not enough weight to wonder boys for it to support a moral to the story . it's possible to spend most of wonder boys grinning at its nonchalance , its goofiness and its small pleasures . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1509,"screenplay/director : oliver stone . the problem with oliver stone , in my humble opinion , has always been that he just doesn't know when to shut up . i have long been a detractor of stone's , but that opinion hasn't been a result of his visual style ; each of his films can boast at least one moment of real flair . unfortunately , stone's tendency towards the pedantic often obscures those elements of his films which do work . heaven and earth , stone's third foray into the vietnam war , is much the same . every once in a while , when he lets his camera do the talking , you can see the potential for greatness , but the talky , over-narrated script blunts the film's power . conflicts with both the v . c . visually , there are several sequences worthy of an oliver stone highlight reel . cinematographer robert richardson's opening shots of ky la are rich and beautiful , including a particularly striking image of an orange-robed buddhist monk walking through tall green grass . there is an intense sequence involving le ly's torture at the hands of the southern government which had the entire audience gasping and squirming . perhaps most notable is the whimsical portrayal of le ly's first encounters with american consumer culture , including a slow-motion walk to an overstuffed refrigerator and the preparation of a dinner entirely from frozen and canned foods . stone has a keen directorial eye , and heaven and earth is usually interesting to watch . would that stone's ear were so keen . heaven and earth's primary responsibility is to pull the viewer into le ly's suffering , but that never really happened for me . there is very little in the narration which could not have been demonstrated visually , and it acts as a distancing mechanism , providing a retrospective voice which doesn't allow the trials of a teenage girl to seem like they're happening to a teenage girl . it's sloppy screenwriting on stone's part , and all the more disappointing because he's so much better at showing than he is at telling . where we should be focusing on harrowing images , instead we get speeches . newcomer hiep thi le has to carry the two and a half hour film , and essentially she's up to the task . as with most novices , her biggest problems are with scenes requiring big emotions , but those problems are not distracting . le displays le ly's strength and determination admirably , as well as her conviction that karma from a past life is responsible for her current troubles . conchata ferrell is also notable in a scene-stealing turn as le ly's gabby american sister-in-law . butler is only sketchily developed , appearing late in the film and never developing fully enough to make his later actions understandable . still , stone is a fine director of actors , and his cast is basically strong . stone's intention with heaven and earth was clearly to show us that as much as we in america think we suffered as a result of the vietnam war , vietnam suffered more . there are glimpses of that suffering , but it should have been a much easier point to bring across . le ly experiences more suffering than most lifetimes , but it never seemed quite real . elements of heaven and earth carry undeniable impact , but when it was money time he should have descended from his soapbox and let his camera do the talking .

1510,"screenplay : martin sherman . director : waris hussein . in retrospect , my responses to the summer house seem very confusing . i did laugh at this lightweight british comedy ; in fact , i laughed quite a lot . at the same time , i found myself wondering why i wasn't enjoying it more . the summer house is full of quotable one-liners , spirited performances and good intentions . it also never quite adds up to a satisfying film . at just under 80 minutes , the summer house leaves some characters sketched in only the broadest of strokes , and burdens the humor with an unnecessarily dark and cumbersome story structure . the small problem in this scenario : margaret not only doesn't love syl , she doesn't even like him . nearly everything that works in the summer house is thanks to moreau and plowright . moreau is mischievous and full of energy , bordering on over-the-top but just managing to keep the reins on lili . these two fine actresses are extremely entertaining , and the summer house might be considered worth seeing simply for their performances . the characters surrounding them aren't quite so worthy of attention . although ostensibly the centerpiece of the story , margaret is really very poorly defined . david threlfall , who resembles monty python's eric idle while playing one of his unctuous game show host characters , really hasn't got much to do but leer and be slightly off-putting , and his character makes the situation much more ridiculous than it needs to be . even julie walters , a very good actress , is wasted in the role of margaret's mother . there was clearly a great deal of time spent giving these characters funny things to say , but not nearly as much making them real . even more distracting than the absence of real characters is the absence of a coherent plot . the summer house is comprised largely of snippets of witty conversation , funny in their own right but never moving towards anything . the details of margaret's affair are revealed in distracting flashbacks , and the entire issue of the marriage seems sometimes to be in the way of the characters quipping . there are also some disturbing undercurrents--intimations of child abuse , an unexplained violent death--which seem grossly out of place and entirely unnecessary . ultimately , i can give the summer house a mild recommendation because of the laughs it provides , but i was disappointed by the unrealized potential for something a bit more human .

1511,"i don't think any american filmmaker in my lifetime has had his personal life as closely associated with his films as woody allen . the compulsively auto-analytical allen created a classic film persona , but he also created a monster : a body of work constantly being read for clues about its creator . at first , it may sound like another apologia for the artist as world-class clod , a la deconstructing harry , but there's actually something more going on in the character of emmet ray . if he's not the best there is at his art , he may not be able to justify his self-imposed isolation from emotional connection . i'm coming to believe that sean penn may be the most talented american actor alive . penn does so many things right as emmet that it suddenly becomes evident that allen doesn't quite know how to handle it when an actor can make his script seem irrelevant . the light-hearted structure , with jazz scholars commenting talking-head style on emmet's misadventures , becomes jarring and distracting as emmet's story unfolds . episodes like emmet's attempt to con an amateur talent contest or his role in a botched hold-up ( told in three possible variations ) feel like forced attempts at giving the film a woody allen sensibility . only when allen holds penn unexpectedly in the dead center of a reaction shot -- a crucial exchange with another character where you'd usually expect a cutaway -- does it appear the director understands what he has working for him . samantha morton has also received plenty of praise for her role as a mute laundress with whom emmet has a lengthy relationship , and it's certainly an impressive physical performance . it's also clear how much morton is contributing to the story when she leaves the story , only to be replaced as primary romantic interest by the gratingly mannered uma thurman . but this is a jazz odyssey that works thanks to a stunning lead performance of a fascinating character , in spite of a structure always on the verge of sabotaging that character . you might suspect that the notoriously private allen was using sweet and lowdown as a first attempt to really open himself up emotionally on screen , but found it so awkward that he had to keep telling jokes . or maybe he's just an imperfect filmmaker who cast a great actor in an imperfect film . naaaaahhhh . . . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1513,"starring : stockard channing , will smith , donald sutherland . screenplay : john guare . director : fred schepisi . there are few greater cinematic challenges than adapting a stage play for the screen . the two media are so different -- one primarily of words , the other of images -- that some plays just don't lend themselves to a film rendering . for every amadeus , a play which was opened up into a grand period drams , there is one a few good men , too talky and stagy to succeed fully . that is the problem i fear many viewers could have with six degrees of separation . thematically , john guare's play is quite rich , as it is in character . however , its rapid-fire dialogue and exaggerated acting will strike those unfamiliar with live theater as too stylized and unrealistic . the characters at the heart of six degrees are marvelously intricate , tying together an examination of the vagaries of fortune . where this theme could have come off as a liberal social manifesto , six degrees treads lightly , making the obsession of the kitteredges and their cronies with finding the man who had duped them comic but clear in its message : their world is threatened if just * anyone * can appear to be one of them . the snag in six degrees is that even with its clever editing , even with its location photography , it still feels far too much like a stage play . don't misunderstand , i love live theater . it is just that acting styles and narrative choices which work when a performance is in real time by actual size human beings one hundred feet away don't work when those same human beings are twenty feet high . will smith's genteel paul poitier persona seems too forced and phony for anyone to accept , even the star-struck kitteredges , and the problem is that he's giving a big , broad performance much better suited to the stage . as a result , although i was intrigued with what six degrees had to say , the staginess of the production didn't allow me to get caught up in it . to be fair , not all of the performances have that quality . donald sutherland does an extremely sharp reading of flanders , never permitting him to appear stupid , which it would have been exceedingly easy to do . his sense of outrage grows as his facade crumbles , and he conveys that tension with subtlety and style . six degrees of separation provides some very funny human comedy in an extremely well-constructed story . it's also a story which works much better on stage .

1514,"screenplay : jack bernstein , tom shadyac & jim carrey . director : tom shadyac . as many individual elements as i might analyze with any given film , my gut reaction almost always comes down to one crucial issue : did the film do what it was trying to do ? if it was a thriller , did it keep me in suspense ? if it was a romance , did i respond emotionally ? and if it was a comedy , did i laugh ? of all the film types , comedy is perhaps the most difficult to analyze ; either it works , or it doesn't . which brings me to this confession : i laughed at ace ventura : pet detective . god help me , i laughed quite a bit . comedian jim carrey's unique persona won me over in spite of a great deal of stupidity and some sluggish pacing . vanity projects are a dime a dozen these days , but they all apply a very similar logic , namely that if you let the star do what he or she does best , and if that star's audience is large enough , you'll have a success . i'm not sure whether the latter condition is true of carrey , but it is true that he's allowed to do what he does best . it has been a long time since i've seen a physical comedian who looks as comfortable on screen as carrey . his elastic features recall early jerry lewis , while his spindly frame and geeky self- confidence show traces of pee-wee herman . when the comedy is purely physical , the laughs are really big . the opening sequence features ace disguised as a parcel deliveryman gleefully shattering the contents of his package to simulate a shipping mishap . ace ventura boasts some of the most amusing slapstick in recent years this side of the zucker-abrahams-zucker films . it's considerably more erratic in its success when it comes to verbal gags . in fact , ace ventura is almost self-congratulatory in its political incorrectness , using homophobia and sexism as punch lines . the film drags between visual set pieces , rescued only by carrey's goofy delivery . part of the problem is that screenwriters carrey , tom shadyac and jack bernstein frequently seem unclear as to when enough is enough . ace's trademark mocking cackle , borrowed from carrey's fire marshall bill character from "" in living color , "" is funny once but not three times . a more telling example involves the theme song from the crying game , used perfectly once but then used again so that it just seems derivative . finally , one piece of advice for filmmakers : if you must use dan marino for a cameo , please don't give him too many lines . an isotoner glove commercial is about all i can take . there would seem to be little point to commenting on the supporting players in ace ventura , since for all practical purposes they serve as scenery with sag cards . she has a fun , over-the-top part much like her role in fatal instinct , but wisely she avoids trying to steal scenes from carrey . it just wouldn't work . in ace ventura , jim carrey establishes himself as a first-rate screen clown , one i hope to see again .

1515,"keeping the faith is not a feature length version of the old joke about a priest and a rabbi walking into a bar . . . not exactly , anyway . the set-up finds director/co-star edward norton exploiting exactly that concept as his character -- new york catholic priest brian finn -- relates the film's story to an incredulous barkeep . there's a lot of ground to be covered in a romantic comedy that also introduces questions of faith , cultural and religious melting pots and balancing career and personal goals . and keeping the faith seems intent on covering every last square foot of it . screenwriter stuart blumberg dashes madly back and forth between themes , while norton dashes madly back and forth between tones ( how else to describe a sentimental romance that also includes slapstick dips in holy water fonts and the surreal inclusion of "" heroes of the torah "" trading cards ? ) . oh , and somewhere along the way they're supposed to fit in a love story . it's no wonder norton felt the need to have a lightweight film clock in at two hours plus . thank heaven that keeping the faith is often quite funny in its fragmented , scattershot way . blumberg's script is ripe with good dialogue , and a couple of solidly crafted set pieces ( including a jewish american princess date from hell ) . stiller continues to build a body of comic screen work that measures up to any of his contemporaries , giving zing to jake's self-deprecating manner . there are eye-catching bit parts , including ken leung in a very funny scene as a karaoke machine salesman . and there's jenna elfman , who has never particularly impressed me in the past except as a ball of energy . here she's a completely convincing object of desire ( even if norton lingers on her close-ups a bit too lovingly ) , luminous , intelligent and driven . as one part of a romantic pairing , she's a tough act to match . the match , as it turns out , becomes one of keeping the faith's bigger problems . the premise is sound enough , but stiller never looks comfortable as a romantic lead . in fact , there's more plausible chemistry between elfman and norton , and not just because both actors are blonde -- the pairing we're expected to root for just doesn't seem like a particularly good combination of personalities . how much more interesting -- and daring -- keeping the faith might have been if the film had suggested anna was merely sublimating her desire for brian with jake , making for much tougher choices at the film's conclusion . that's probably too much to ask from a film that , at its core , is a fairly fluffy hollywood confection . it's certainly a pleasant enough diversion , good for more than enough chuckles to make it worth a look , but it's surprisingly timid for a film that tries to cover so many thematic elements . it's also a lot warmer 'n' fuzzier than you'd expect from the cinematic equivalent of "" a priest and a rabbi walk into a bar . . .

1517,"screenplay : sofia coppola , based on the novel by jeffrey eugenides . director : sofia coppola . all right , admit it : the credits "" written and directed by sofia coppola "" don't exactly set the heart racing in anticipation of artistic triumph . your defining image of sofia coppola probably involves her single-handedly making the godfather part iii painful to watch . or maybe you go back farther , to her script credit on the lifeless "" life with zoe "" segment of new york stories . if so , then consider this ( perhaps faint ) praise for the virgin suicides : sofia shows more visual flair in her directorial debut than papa francis has managed to show in the last 20 years or so . if only she had managed a bit more story sense . stylistically , coppola does plenty to keep the film interesting . there are few gimmicks she's unwilling to employ : slow-motion , split screens , odd angles . she also crafts one extremely effective sequence at a homecoming dance that captures every nuance of adolescent romantic fumbling . her approach shows coppola understands that the virgin suicides is not a simple narrative , but a flashback remembrance of pubescent fantasy . the girls are representations of idealized visions by the story's collective male narrator ( given voice by giovanni ribisi ) , not fully-realized characters -- and that's fine . sounds good on paper , doesn't it ? it's true that coppola gives the virgin suicides just the right atmosphere , but she never manages to latch onto anything that would give the story focus or momentum . her biggest mistake is making arbitrary use of the novel's structure as a remembrance told from a distance of many years , much of it through imperfectly recalled interviews with key players . it's a great scene -- effectively demonstrating the lasting effect the lisbon girls had on those around them -- but it also serves to show how much better the film would have been with more moments like it . the tale's young male observers also disappear for long stretches , allowing the film to drift into trite suburban family drama . on the page , the virgin suicides was hypnotic and mysterious ; on the screen , it's a collection of eye-catching individual moments that too rarely coalesce into something more profound . in a cinematic climate where films about adolescents usually bear little resemblance to reality , it's refreshing to find a film-maker interested in capturing the tangled emotions of that time . sofia coppola is working from a fundamentally strong source , and she has put together a cast and crew that make the virgin suicides worth watching ( and worth listening to , with its sublimely kitschy soundtrack of period tunes by elo , styx and heart ) . when it latches on to those moments of wonder at the emerging adulthood of the opposite sex -- one boy's wide-eyed discovery of feminine hygiene products in the lisbon bathroom , for instance -- it's dead on target . unfortunately , there's also too much of the mundane in coppola's adaptation . if she develops as much instinct for storytelling as she does for directing , sofia coppola could be a film-maker to watch for . and there's a prospect i'll bet you never expected . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1518,"screenplay : gina prince-bythewood . director : gina prince-bythewood . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 120 minutes . love for the game of basketball -- and for women's basketball in particular -- fills virtually every frame of gina price-bythewood's love and basketball . she even does something i never expected to see in a sports film , something that sent this hoops purist into a rapture : she has her heroine win a big game not by taking the last shot , but by taking an offensive foul . she knows them well enough that it makes up for the sluggish narrative to which she attaches them . there's a nice scene in which the two 11-year-olds go from first kiss to knock-down brawl in the space of a few seconds , neatly summarizing the competitiveness that will sabotage their mutual attraction . it takes a special performance to lend credibility to wild swings of emotion . lathan nails every twist in monica's life journey . in theory , the film follows the careers of both quincy and monica equally , but it's always evident where price-bythewood's heart is . quincy's character is far less interesting from the outset , since he's already a high school star . nearly every time quincy or his family are drawn into the story , there's a palpable loss of energy , a more predictable arc to the drama . making it a story with two equal protagonists repeatedly makes it evident that price-bythewood doesn't understand quincy nearly as well as she understands monica . by the time the film draws to a close after two hours , you may feel as though it has gone into at least one overtime . gina price-bythewood builds a sense of the epic into the relationship between quincy and monica , but there's always the sense that it would have been much more effective as a smaller , more intimate story . it's a very good film when it focuses on one woman's attempt to create a happy personal life that also includes the game she loves ; it's pretty mediocre when it tries ineffectively to give equal time to the men . it may be my long-standing affinity for women's basketball talking , but i wanted a film about the one character in which the filmmaker clearly had the most emotional investment . women finally have a basketball league of their own ; it shouldn't have been too much to ask to give them a basketball movie of their own . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1519,"now that we have dispensed with the obvious , can we ponder for a moment the mystery of why she continues to pull down roles in films with edge and attitude , since she appears to have little of either ? and in austin powers : the spy who shagged me , even competence eluded her . i can only guess that graham gives killer auditions . on screen , she melts into the art direction whenever she's not serving the function of well , you get the picture . lisa krueger's committed is a goofy , quirky sort-of romantic comedy that offers some pleasant character-based amusement . the fact that it's not more is only partly graham's fault . krueger may even have intended the film as a commentary on the way society looks at people with passionate commitments . there's something intriguing about the way it is assumed someone who will fight to the end for a marriage must be a bit nuts , just as it is assumed fervent believers in anything must be a bit nuts . actually , committed only teases with subtext , since it's not much of a commentary on anything . that doesn't mean it's not entertaining in a sporadic , out-of-left-field sort of way . whenever committed seems to have been lurching along far too long in search of a good scene , it finds one that delivers unexpected laughs ( patricia velasquez as an utterly indifferent restaurant waitress ; alfonso arau in a too-rare screen appearance as a kindly mexican medicine man ) . neil's full-aura massage of joline is one of the sexiest screen scenes ever in which no one lays a body part on anyone else . i wish it all felt like it added up to more , but there's a huge hole at the center of committed . unfortunately , she appears to spend all her acting energy on the work of yanking joline from the jaws of caricature . committed is one of those films in which the things going on around the main character end up far more interesting than anything happening to the main character herself . perhaps that's the way krueger wrote it , retreating to the same isn't-this-all-terribly-indie mannerisms that shackled krueger's previous effort manny & lo . or perhaps everything around joline just seems more interesting because graham doesn't have the presence to command the narrative's focus . i kept wanting to see more edge in joline's connubial stalking , and realizing there was no way i'd ever get it . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1520,"screenplay : toby emmerich . producers : bill carraro & toby emmerich and hawk koch & gregory hoblit . director : gregory hoblit . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , violence , profanity ) running time : 118 minutes . just when i thought i'd seen every possible spin on the serial killer thriller , here comes frequency to show that there is something new under the sun . time-travel tales are inevitably head-scratching affairs if you ponder them for too long , and frequency is no exception . it's an utterly preposterous conceit , of course , but it actually works . caviezel never once smirks at the material , resulting in a performance full of convincingly pent-up emotion . director gregory hoblit's staging of john's new montage of memory is surprisingly affecting ; caviezel's work as a man re-discovering his father is better than you have any reason to expect in a genre film . now , did i mention that this all turns into a serial killer thriller at some point ? hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich might have chosen to explore the ramifications of continuing to mess with history , but that would be a bit too philosophically deep . frequency is a genuinely snappy piece of film-making , far and away the liveliest work from hoblit ( who got bogged down in the grim subject matter of primal fear and fallen ) , even when you're inspired to a round of "" yeah , right . "" there's no question that much of frequency is smart and entertaining , but it's also a fragmented piece of work . for the first half of the film , it's a fantasy with a strong human side , anchored by an unconventional but convincing father-son relationship . in the second hour , it shifts dramatically to a creep-show , with the sinister killer popping up at terribly inconvenient times . that makes for some crowd-pleasing chases and struggles , but a terribly rote plot progression . though there are still some well-crafted scenes -- andre braugher gets a particularly good one as a cop friend of frank's watching a world series prediction come true -- character ceases to matter for all practical purposes . the strange thing is that it probably wouldn't have felt nearly as overwrought if frequency had stuck with the tone of its first half . the shift from character piece to thriller is jarring enough ; the attempt to shift back to character piece feels like an unearned piece of manipulation . it's easy to recommend frequency for the things it does right in each of its incarnations , but the recommendation can't be too enthusiastic when those incarnations are so incongruous . i think there's a reason we've never seen this sort of serial killer thriller before : it's awfully hard to make a serial killer thriller a tear-jerker as well . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"" big mistake . without a sense that there's some sort of cultural lesson to be taken away from the gruesome events , they simply become gruesome events . i'd never read titus andronicus nor seen any production before this one , and i can't say i'm terribly eager to see it again . yet while titus is far from a gripping story , it's still a pretty decent piece of theater . taymor's roots are on broadway ( she directed the stage production of the lion king ) , but that doesn't mean she can't make use of a camera . at times , titus almost seems to be the work of a director who isn't sure if she'll ever get the chance to make a film again , so she leaves everything she's got on the screen . it's hard to imagine so grim a tale given more energy through sheer force of a director's imagination . it would be a cruel misuse of the word "" entertaining "" to say that titus qualifies . it's well-acted enough -- cumming in particular is a delight as the foppish saturninus -- but not a showcase for master thespianism . in fact , anthony hopkins' best moment may be a ghoulish reference to his renown as cinema's most famous cannibal . i didn't enjoy all that much of titus , but i found myself admiring taymor's choices even when i didn't understand them , or even agree with them . simply put , titus is a display of film-making nerve -- the spectacle of a novice movie director deciding to pick shakespeare for her first work , and one of shakespeare's least respected works at that , then molding it into something consistently watchable . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1522,"screenplay : joel coen , ethan coen & sam raimi . director : joel coen . the coen brothers are : a ) a pair of intellectual dilettante/pop cannibals whose films lack any kind of soul . b ) a pair of brilliant visual stylists who manipulate genre into something completely original . your choice will probably tell you all you need to know about how you would react to the hudsucker proxy . coen brothers fans will revel in their delightfully off-center perspective and their twisted sense of humor ; their detractors will grouse over their cold mechanics and inaccessibility . and both sides will be correct . fortunately , there is more that dazzles than there is that distracts . that buffoon is norville barnes . however , norville has at least one trick up his sleeve . many of those off-putting elements which have limited the coens' appeal are still in place . director joel is given to wild , manic set pieces and near constant camera movement , which often seem to yell , "" look at me , i'm a director ! "" fans of vintage cinema note that their spins on established genres read like film school projects : make a "" film noir , "" make a gangster film . the hudsucker proxy clearly owes most of its inspiration to frank capra's meet john doe , with nods to sturges and hawks along the way . at a certain point , however , homage gives way to parody ; jennifer jason leigh's clipped katherine hepburn/barbara stanwyck delivery is cute for a while but eventually becomes annoying , while paul newman simply seems cartoonish as the snarling , cigar-chomping wheeler dealer . but perhaps most disappointing is the character of norville , whom the coens and co-scripter sam raimi didn't seem to have any interest in making interesting . there's almost a mockery of capra's everyman heroes , who were simple but always imbued with common sense . consequently , it's hard to care about anything except what is on the surface . of course , there is plenty more going on on the surface of a coen brothers film than any dozen other films put together . dennis gassner's production design is part gotham city , part brazil , but stunningly evocative in its own right , while carter burwell provides a fantastic and diverse score . however , it is with two magnificent visual pieces that hudsucker makes its mark . there are dozens of individually memorable moments , lines and scenes , which makes it all the more frustrating that they aren't supported by a memorable story . with triumphant films like miller's crossing and barton fink , the coens have established themselves as among the most original filmmakers of their generation . still , it has only been on rare occasions that they have appeared as concerned with creating characters as they have with framing shots . the hudsucker proxy is worth seeing for its quirky invention , but it's hard not to wish that so much talent could come with a little more heart .

1523,"in a way , it has been a sad thing watching woody allen grow as an artist . i recall watching allen as bumbling would-be thief virgil starkwell in take the money and run as a youth every time it appeared on local television ; i remember the raucous laughter inspired by peeks at the naughtier everything you always wanted to know about sex and sleeper . in my heart i longed for allen to return to arrested adolescence in something besides his romantic life , to a brand of comedy even solid films like manhattan murder mystery and bullets over broadway didn't provide . in my heart , i longed for allen to become virgil starkwell once again . i suppose i couldn't have asked for more convincing proof than small time crooks that virgil starkwell is , in fact , dead . the abrupt shift in plot from caper comedy to fish-out-of-water comedy takes some adjusting , but it neither makes the film nor ruins it . as with most of allen's comedies of the last decade , there are just enough lively gags to remind you why it's still worth looking forward to his films , and just enough dead spots to remind you that he's just not the same . no shift in allen's sensibility has been more damaging to his sense of humor than the ever-increasing level of condescension in his films . there's one delightful moment in small time crooks that nearly re-captures that vibe -- allen trying to slip away unobtrusively at a posh party -- but more often the joke is on someone else . while elaine may is amusing as frenchie's brain-dead cousin , she's also a walking punch line for ray's sense of superiority . when the film gradually becomes a lesson in being careful what you wish for in case you actually get it , it's ray's world of simple pleasures that's held up as the ideal . i'd still rather watch any one of allen's last dozen films ( celebrity notably excepted ) than the majority of what turns up on the local multiplex screen . unfortunately , you keep getting the sense that he knows it , that he's grown so enamored of his ability to impress that he forgets what an incredible gift he has simply to make us laugh . there's a sequence in small time crooks in which the film's characters are interviewed by "" 60 minutes' "" steve kroft for a newsmagazine story . there's some funny stuff in that sequence , but it kept reminding me of the documentary style of take the money and run . in small time crooks , it's almost as though allen is trying to appease those aliens from stardust memories who cracked wise about enjoying his "" early , funny "" films . yet even when he's turning out a passably entertaining comedy , it's clear he just doesn't have any virgil starkwell left in him . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1525,"starring : denis leary , judy davis , kevin spacey . screenplay : richard lagravenese and marie weiss . good scripts are so rare in hollywood that it should be a felony when one gets wasted . sometimes it's dreadful miscasting ; sometimes it's a director without an ounce of vision . the dilemma in which i find myself in such cases is how to temper my response to the things the film failed to do with acknowledgment of its strengths . last year's true romance was one of those films , and the ref is another . there are a lot of laughs in the ref , more than most recent comedies have provided , yet i found it consistently and infuriatingly falling short of the comic plateau it might have achieved in more skilled directorial hands . the script for the ref , by richard lagravenese ( the fisher king ) and marie weiss , is full of comic and dramatic potential , only some of which ever makes it to the screen . comic denis leary gets the lead billing in his first starring role , but it is the sparring of spacey and davis which carries the film . their acid-filled tirades in the film's first half hour are extremely funny , and the two characters are surprisingly well-rounded . but the ref never makes the leap to the outrageous . leary and his director ted demme , who collaborated on a series of promo spots for mtv a couple of years ago which popularized leary's ranting , chain-smoking stand-up persona , seem too concerned here with separating leary from that persona . consequently , he plays a number of scenes far too low-key , and in fact fades into the background almost completely in the last half hour . a number of early verbal confrontations are exceptionally well-written , as all three of the principal characters make their case , and it is to the credit of lagravenese and weiss that at various times all three appear to be completely right and completely wrong . insults fly , and leary merely stands around looking exasperated . there are too many funny things going on in the ref for it to be a complete failure . i found the town's ill-prepared police force and its disgusted chief to be a hilarious subplot , and their handling of a piece of videotaped evidence is a winner . spacey and davis exchange some of the most caustic dialogue since the war of the roses , a style i always enjoy .

1526,"screenplay : david koepp and steven koepp . director : ron howard . after establishing himself with gentle mass-market fantasies and taking a break for an overstuffed comedy , this man got the bug to be taken seriously as a director ; the results tended to be as notable for their excesses as their successes . sound like i'm describing steven spielberg ? not surprising . ron howard's career as a director has often seemed too consciously patterned after spielberg's ( although there are clearly worse models ) , and has represented much that is best and worst about his much more successful colleague's work . the paper is one of these films . it's a bit too busy and precocious for its own good , but still has enough of a charming throwback quality that i was willing to forgive many of its flaws . the paper is delivered with an energy that matches the barely controlled chaos of the newsroom , and that energy is nearly enough to sell the film all by itself . the go-go pacing echoes newspaper films of past decades , the same films the current the hudsucker proxy parodies . indeed , while there is a decidedly 90's spin to the proceedings ( no film of the 40's would ask if its hero were spending too little time with his wife ) , the paper still features such standbys as the gruff editor , the wet-behind-the-ears reporter ( here a photographer ) , and an ethical dilemma . there is nothing daringly original about the way the paper serves up these elements , but the setting itself is so lively and the cast generally so engaging that the lack of originality doesn't assault you . keaton , in his third collaboration with howard , delivers a solid protagonist even though the role demands little of his considerable talents . less successful are close and duvall , but that certainly isn't the fault of the two talented actors . as a result , it seems like we're getting snippets from an entirely different movie . bernie's story is just filling up minutes . it's too bad , because a resolution connected to bernie's family troubles would have been much more effective than the one we get . that resolution includes a bar scene which suffers from extremely sloppy editing leading into not one but two medical crises . it seems like a ron howard film isn't complete without someone dying or nearly dying , as though he doesn't trust any conclusion not based on the biggest possible emotion . what had been a taut , energetic film about priorities and the thrill of reporting bogs down seriously in the final fifteen minutes . it's not quite enough to sabotage the paper's strengths completely , but it does show once again that ron howard the "" serious director "" too often equates serious with saccharine .

1527,"supervising director : hendel butoy . mpaa rating : g running time : 74 minutes . even today , 20 years after i first saw the original fantasia and 60 years after its premiere , i'm still not sure whether the entire concept is audaciously praiseworthy or pretentiously misguided . on the one hand , it could be seen as a sincere effort to bring kids to the castor oil of the classics , with a little eye candy as sweetener . more cynically , it could be seen as an attempt to persuade parents to take kids to a cartoon because it's really "" good for them "" -sort of like extolling pizza as nutritionally sound because it includes all four food groups . yet another possibility is that it's an intriguing case study in individual interpretation of an artistic work -- with all the peaks and valleys that concept entails . there's the sense that fantasia/2000's creative team felt obliged to maintain a balance between the experimental and the whimsical , when the experimental pieces are the ones that leave the strongest impression . most dazzling of all is butoy's computer-animated "" pines of rome , "" in which the image of whales soaring into the sky almost returns the literal meaning to the word "" breathtaking ; "" that moment alone made me wish i'd had the chance to experience the film in its imax incarnation from earlier this year . it's a wondrous piece of work that creates its own world , a feat the "" firebird suite "" segment comes close to matching ( though there's more than a little princess mononoke to the imagery ) . there is also an undeniable energy to the "" rhapsody in blue "" segment , directed by eric goldberg ( aladdin ) with a clockwork story sense and an obvious affection for the artists who inspired both the look and the sound . when fantasia/2000 really lets its creative talent loose to explore the unfamiliar , the results are impressive . with "" pomp , "" there's the greater problem of the music's undeniable connection to a specific context : graduation ceremonies . in fact , there's something just a bit off about all of the segments connected to instantly recognizable music-the grandiose abstractions of beethoven's fifth , the duck tales-goes-genesis "" pomp , "" even the generally satisfying "" rhapsody in blue . "" it may have been part of the fantasia plan to say , "" look , here's another way to look at a piece of music you may have pigeonholed previously , "" but it doesn't always work . a magical mickey defined "" the sorcerer's apprentice "" in the first fantasia ; an antediluvian donald just makes you wonder why all these animals are graduating from the ark . admittedly , a couple of them are good for laughs ( steve martin and penn & teller , to be specific ) . the rest are an overly reverential bore . it's a curious decision , because if there's one thing the rest of fantasia/200 is not , it's reverential . even when it flounders , it usually flounders because an experiment fails , not because someone was unwilling to experiment . and that's the faint damnation with which i ultimately praise the film : it doesn't always work , but even when it doesn't work , it's in ways that make it obvious someone was still trying . this fantasia inclines me to the perspective that it should be seen as a showcase for pure inspiration , a way to see how fine art can in turn inspire more fine art . this version is an uneven realization of that vision . i'll still be looking forward to fantasia/2060 . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1528,"screenplay/director : andrew fleming . i think "" the wonder years "" may be to blame . there was a time when i didn't take particular notice of voiceover narration one way or the other ; it was just another part of a movie . now i'm not sure whether it is the content of the narration or my perception that has changed , but it seems lately that hearing narration at the beggining of a film is enough to make me suspicious . there comes with some narration a pretentiousness that can weigh down a simple story or pummel an audience over the head with a moral . threesome has all the elements to be a successful lighthearted character romp , but many of its strengths are obscured by the moments it takes itself far too seriously . threesome is set up almost as a three-character stage play wherein other characters exist only to make observations on the behavior of the three principal characters , and those characters are established with widely varying degrees of success . stuart is probably the most interesting and fully-rounded character , one who bears many of the marks of a stereotypical college jerk but responds to his roommate's sexual orientation with minimal sturm und drang . stephen baldwin is surprisingly charming in the role , spewing forth sexual single-entendre with an infectious enthusiasm . still , there comes a point where his heaviness is a bit much for an audience to take . alex is part sex kitten , part basket case , and several other parts of several other characters , and it's difficult for anyone to strike the right tone with such a character . what did work strike a chord with me was the interaction between the three characters , which was extremely reminiscent of relationships i knew . the dialogue , while tending toward the unrealistic , is still frequently funny , and i found myself basically engaged in the lives of these three people as long as they weren't navel-gazing about how hard it all was . and it is on the level of its self-consciousness that threesome falls somewhat flat . what could have been a lively and fairly entertaining look at a slightly different kind of romantic triangle instead becomes a film that tries far too hard to be * about * something . the narration , which comes retrospectively from eddy , is filled with descriptions that could just as easily have been provided visually , and with pseudo-profound pronouncements about that wrong turn that becomes the best part of a trip . there are a couple of three-way love scenes which are handled deftly , but much of andrew fleming's direction is leaden . it appears as though he wasn't quite clear that he had a decent little comedy on his hands ; it wasn't really necessary to try to turn it into an earth-shaking drama .

1529,"screenplay : iain softley , stephen ward & michael thomas . director : iain softley . from the phrasing of that question , it would appear that at least one change from the original lineup of the beatles is assumed to be part of the popular consciousness . it is an intriguing and atmospheric study of a complicated romantic triangle , but it lacks solid performances across the board to back up ian hart's dynamic work as john lennon . although of whom is not entirely clear . director and co-writer iain softley has a unique perspective from which to tell the story of the beatles' rise from ragged cover band to international icons , so backbeat never becomes simply an "" early years "" bio-pic . it does boast some clever music numbers which highlight the band's frustration with their seedy environs , and an exciting sense of place . this theme is highlighted in one of the film's best sequences , when stu plays hooky from a recording session to spend the day with astrid , as softley cross-cuts between the ever rowdier session and stu's idyllic encounter . still , backbeat could have been much , much stronger with some better acting in two of the three lead performances . it's certainly not the fault of ian hart , who has cornered the market on playing a homoeroticized lennon after this film and 1991's the hours and times . whereas in most films a line like , "" we're going to be too big for our own bloody good "" would come off as silly historical revisionism , it seems plausible coming from hart's cynical visionary . his brilliance is emphasized , unfortunately , by the blandness of co-stars stephen dorff and sheryl lee . dorff's stu is always a bit too low-key , even when he's doing his painting , so as a dramatic character he never becomes all that interesting . she doesn't inject enough life into her performance to make it clear why everyone seems so fascinated by her . and sadly , americans dorff and lee are both saddled with uncomfortable accents . backbeat needs to feed off the conflict in this central triangle , but there's not enough spark to their interaction , and the film often plays like the commitments on quaaludes . as long as the music is playing , backbeat is quite good . if only more of that energy could have carried off stage .

"" in his typically skewed fashion , greenaway has made an intentionally un-titillating cautionary tale . if only greenaway's films felt as much like stories of real people as they felt like lessons . there's no question that greenaway is a superb film stylist ; he crafts powerful compositions like the interchanging medium- and close-range shot of the father and son conversing by the indoor pool , ripples reflecting off the walls . his films too often lack real emotional resonance , however , and 8-1/2 women is no exception . there are isolated moments when philip's grief seems more central to the story than the director's aesthetics , and there's a surprisingly funny scene in which one female servant discusses her failed "" try-out "" for the harem with a co-worker . more often , 8-1/2 women is another case of greenaway giving his audience lots to look at , a bit less to think about and virtually nothing to feel . he's a maker of intriguing but only fitfully satisfying films that happen to include lots of penises and breasts . he may be cinema's foremost purveyor of art-core porn . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1533,"screenplay : ken kaufman and howard klausner . producers : andrew lazar and clint eastwood . director : clint eastwood . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 130 minutes . space cowboys will be greeted with enthusiasm in a certain demographic group simply because it dares to suggest that americans over the age of 60 exist . that's a fairly revolutionary notion in pop culture , most of which is targeted at an audience that still gets graded in "" nap-time "" and "" scissors . "" it's also a rare opportunity for veteran actors to get work in major roles , so you can't blame anyone involved for being enthusiastic about the project , especially given its themes . it's fun to watch a film like space cowboys -- and probably even more fun for those viewers in the stars' peer group -- because the film itself could be an example of what its protagonists are trying to demonstrate : sometimes , wisdom and experience trump washboard abs . clint eastwood has been around the block a few times in hollywood , so you'd think that his experience would teach him the difference between a good idea and a good script . there's more than a little bit of grumpy old astronauts to space cowboys , with screenwriters ken kaufman and howard klausner taking advantage of time-worn senior citizen incongruities . it's cheap humor , but it's still amusing because the performers seem dignified even when they're doing silly things , and because everyone seems to be having so much fun doing it . in any other outer space adventure , the hour-plus wait for the astronauts to get off the ground would be excruciating . it's bad enough that once the daedalus mission is underway , the good humor and cameraderie of the training center sequences vanishes , leaving nothing but crisis resolution-based plotting . worse still is the mission itself , a ridiculous "" surprise "" that would have been evident even if eastwood hadn't filmed certain characters with ominous slow-zoom close-ups to signal their soon-to-be-revealed villainy . eastwood doesn't even seem interested in the entire third act , racing through the events at such a frantic pace ( particularly for the usually meandering director ) that you may wonder if he was running out of film . more likely , he understands that once the entertaining interplay between the actors gives way to shaky-cam explosions , there's not much reason to wait before sprinting toward the credits . space cowboys builds up enough good will through its first 80 minutes to carry it over the massive hump of its lame conclusion . eastwood is still one of the most uniquely evocative visual film-makers around -- a director generally willing to linger where other directors would cut -- which generally makes his films worth experiencing . his style also makes him a uniquely appropriate choice for a film about characters that have reached the point in life where they'd rather amble than run . space cowboys ambles right along with eastwood , jones , sutherland and garner , right up to the point where they amble into the conclusion of a generic summer action film . this kind of veteran acting talent deserves better . wisdom and experience should tell someone like clint eastwood that there's plenty of kids' stuff out there without trying to make him and his co-stars part of it . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"" the script doesn't even give a character arc to its ostensible protagonist , shue's dr . mckay . perhaps she too could have been tempted , or learned something about scientific hubris . ultimately , it's nothing but a technically proficient mad slasher movie . make that a fairly diverting , technically proficient mad slasher movie , at least during its high-energy third act . the film turns from a gloss on cronenberg's the fly to a gloss on both alien and aliens ( though i actually enjoyed the nod to westworld , with josh brolin following in papa james' footsteps in a cat-and-mouse game involving thermal perception ) . the final 20 minutes becomes a frantic and generally entertaining hack-n-slash through the supporting cast members , leading up to an appropriately ridiculous climax . it's too bad verhoeven and screenwriter andrew w . marlowe weren't interested in putting some meat on hollow man's bones . even with all its visceral appeal , it could have been so much more interesting to watch the story of the guy who wants to walk into the girls' locker room with impunity , instead of the guy who wants to walk into the girls' locker room and blow it up . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1535,"screenplay : ronald bass and al franken . director : luis mandoki . this is the contradiction of when a man loves a woman : as impressed as i was with most of its parts , i kept coming up with better ways to piece them together . it's that rare film that pulls very few punches in its examination of a family in crisis , but there is a schizophrenia in the perspective . there are some extremely effective performances , but director luis mandoki shows us far too much from the perspective of the alcoholic character . but that might be even harder than it first appears , as the lack of social lubricant exposes cracks in michael and alice's relationship , and the time comes for hard decisions . he doesn't respect alice , and a couple of great scenes demonstrate how he treats her like one of his children . ryan is solid as the fragile and frightened alice , and plays a very restrained drunk . she also makes a believable transition after her detox , leading into a fine bit of acting in a counseling session . the big showdown between michael and alice is completely raw and very compelling , and garcia and ryan have tremendous chemistry . i felt this was essentially the story of the family's response to and discovery of the extent of alice's problem , and not the story of alice and her recovery . consequently , i wasn't bothered by the slickness of the production , because it fit with michael's lack of awareness of what was going on beneath the surface . but then mandoki and screenwriters ronald bass and al franken seem to want it both ways , showing us alice sneaking into the street for a drink , or in the middle of a case of the dt's . a focus on michael would have mad this a very different film from most films about substance abuse , but when a man loves a woman retreats into the obvious . it was moments like her last scene with garcia which finally brought me to tears , and convinced me that there should have been more family moments . the original title of when a man loves a woman was significant other , but it really should have been significant others .

1536,"director : richard donner . one might expect from that list that maverick is a good-looking , good- sounding , good-natured production , and it is . and little more . maverick is pleasant , but it never really takes off , opting to replace a solid narrative with a series of sketches of widely varying quality . gibson plays bret maverick , a roguish gambler much better at playing cards than he is at playing hero . some of these moments are quite entertaining , particularly an encounter with a group of indians with whom maverick enjoys a special rapport . gibson and foster are also quite good together , generating a lot of smiles simply from the spark of their interaction . gibson in particular is perfectly cast as maverick , a sly but ultimately big- hearted fellow with a gift for avoiding danger . there is enough charm and energy in his performance to carry maverick over many of its rough spots . it's a shame that maverick misfires nearly as often as it hits . it's a peculiar mixture of missed opportunities , overkill and necessary but unfortunate editing decisions ( which whittled this once two and a half hour film to a still over-long 2 : 05 ) . when he produces a $100 bill and asks for change , you expect a slick con , but again maverick doesn't quite follow through . once the actor is unmasked , the joke should be over , but it's milked for more than it's worth in a way that made me think , "" all right , i get the joke . "" maverick is full of these fits and starts , making it hard for me to like it as much as i wanted to . maverick concludes with a number of plot turns reminiscent of the sting , and didn't necessarily find them predictable , i didn't really find them all that interesting , either . by the time it hits the final fifteen minutes , maverick finds itself in serious danger of overstaying its welcome , ending with far less energy than it begins . still , maverick is what summer movies are generally meant to be : big , light entertainment . as frequently as it pulled its comedic punches , maverick still had enough dopey fun to be worth a matinee look . but if the inevitable sequel rolls around , i hope gibson , donner and company learn their lesson and start with a script from which they don't need to cut so much .

1537,"how whimsical and amusing does a film need to be before it ceases to matter that it lacks a center -- not just that its center is slight , but that it has no center whatsoever ? such a question plagued me at the end of saving grace , a comedy with that uniquely british quirky appeal . it was a pleasant enough experience for most of its running time , but what in the world was the point ? there are certain kinds of comedies that can get away with a complete lack of an identifiably human character arc . this doesn't seem like it should be one of them . how does one reconcile 90 minutes of grins with the nagging impression that the script was in some ways terribly sloppy ? perhaps the best course of action is simply to roll with it . from the outset , saving grace seems to have nearly every element in place for a wonderfully entertaining piece of middle-brow humor . blethyn anchors the film with a performance that's more restrained than recent outings like little voice , effectively playing incongruous moments like her attempts to sell her product on the streets of london while dressed like the queen mum . perhaps most refreshing , there's an unapologetic quality to the film's just-say-yes story line . it's all quite a bit of silly fun for those with no moral objections , until saving grace winds to its conclusion and it becomes evident that there's something missing -- namely , a third act . but saving grace doesn't bother with developing its characters . grace doesn't appear to grow or learn much of anything , and matthew's change of heart is tacked on almost as an afterthought . there's no sense of consequence anchoring anything that goes on in saving grace , like the unemployed full monty crew's search for a renewed sense of their manhood . it all begins to seem like little more than an excuse on which to hang a bunch of jokes about giggle fits . it would feel like a complete violation of grace's character , if not for the fact that grace's character isn't developed carefully enough for there to be that much violation . such carelessness should be enough to sink a frothy enterprise like saving grace , but somehow it doesn't quite . too many of the quirks work , and too many of the giggle fits inspire similar reactions from the audience . it's no masterwork of comic craftsmanship , but it does the job of taking you somewhere goofy and free of responsibility even though you know it's not particularly good for you . and maybe that's a fitting quality for a film about unapologetic pot smokers . ninety minutes of grins sounds about right . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1538,"screenplay : billy crystal and lowell ganz & babaloo mandel . director : paul weiland . it's a hard life being a sequel . it must be something like being the younger sibling of someone incredibly successful : the self-imposed pressure to deal with the mystique of the predecessor ; inevitable and unforgiving comparisons ; some level or another of disappointment . we , as viewers and critics alike , have tremendous difficulty separating the roman numeral from the name that precedes it , even when the sequel might be a perfectly decent film in its own right . city slickers was a lively , funny film with a dose of warm fuzziness ; city slickers 2 : the legend of curly's gold is less lively , less funny and a bit more heavy-handed in its emotion . for all that , it's still got more laughs than any other comedy out right now , and a dose of high-spirited action besides . one is that avarice isn't nearly as endearing a motivation as self-discovery . there is a lack of depth to much of the humor as a result , and even the fraternal conflict between mitch and glen can't pick up the slack . he indulges billy crystal's worst tendencies toward hamming it up with borscht belt shtick , and daniel stern goes bug-eyed at the slightest provocation . there was an irony and a light touch to ron underwood's direction of the original , a touch weiland doesn't seem to have . however , city slickers 2 is consciously a very different kind of film than its predecessor . it's a big , broad , silly adventure and on that level it succeeds . jack palance is again a delightful presence , amd makes duke a bit nastier yet also more accessible than the crusty curly . no one plays a sadsack quite like lovitz , who outshines his co-stars with his oddball inferiority complex and impromptu renderings of soliloquies from the godfather films . the action sequences , while a bit too familiar , are still well-staged , and the script by crystal and city slickers veterans lowell ganz and babaloo mandel is full of funny lines . they may not always add up to a huge payoff , but they keep coming and there aren't many duds . city slickers 2 centers its character growth on the value of friends and family , but most of the time the emotion seems forced . ganz and mandel seem to require a saccharine center to their comedic confections , and the result is an even greater likelihood of an unfavorable comparison to city slickers . had crystal insisted on a pure romp , he might have scored big . as it stands , city slickers 2 : the legend of curly's gold is a sunny , funny comedy at least as worthwhile as comedy/western competitor maverick . . . and right now , that might be the more valuable comparison .

1540,"i can't imagine a thoughtful movie lover watching one without realizing that director tony barbieri -- a first-time filmmaker -- is in complete command of visual storytelling . he does things veteran directors by the score would shun out of simple fear , though they are likely the best choices for the moment . he embraces a distinctive rhythm , and lets his camera say things his characters can't say . this is neither a flash-for-flash's-sake technical show-off , nor a man content to point his lens at people while they exchange glib dialogue . one is a coming-out party for a director to watch . i'd love to report that barbieri's eye and his narrative restraint make one a must-see film , but it's possible to take narrative restraint to an extreme . the first thing anyone is likely to notice about one is that it doesn't look or move like a typical film . barbieri tells the story of these lingering characters in lingering takes , with performances pitched at a level of quiet resignation . his preferred composition places his camera outside a doorway , with only one of the two characters involved in the scene visible at any time . it's a device he uses perhaps to excess , but he captures effectively the tension between people occupying the same room while living in different worlds . barbieri even makes the subtly audacious choice in one scene to slowly blur the characters in a scene , pulling the focus to an object in the foreground so gradually you may just think your eyes are playing tricks on you . at virtually every moment , i was fascinated by the prospect of what barbieri might do next . the narrative itself , unfortunately , is not nearly so fascinating . it's not that the characters are not compelling ; barbieri and cairns have crafted a pair of enigmatic , lived-in roles in charlie and nick . one simply suffers from a near-crippling case of "" the muteds . "" virtually every emotion and every confrontation isn't just writ small , it's writ to the point that you need a microscope to see it . barbieri may have been aiming for a style that feels real , but he seems scared to death of anything that could be perceived as an emotional high point . he observes and observes and observes -- skillfully , to be sure , but from such a distance that the characters threaten to disappear at any moment . in his zeal to make one feel real , barbieri doesn't allow it to feel at all . even with such a mega-subdued story , one is still strangely watchable . the naturalistic performances are good ; the arc of the two main characters consistently interesting . but it's really about barbieri's knack for using his camera to create a mood . there are many skills that make up a great director : facility with actors , pacing , and yes , setting up the right shot for the right moment . i can't wait for the film he makes when he masters the other two . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1541,"screenplay : ryan rowe & ed solomon and john august . producers : drew barrymore , nancy juvonen and leonard goldberg . director : mcg . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , violence , adult humor ) running time : 92 minutes . charlie's angels is the sort of marvelously out-of-control hollywood contraption that can turn any critic into joe bob briggs . drew barrymore's cleavage . big-ass explosions . more of drew barrymore's cleavage . tom green extended cameo . and one pygmy nuthatch . by any reasonable filmmaking standard , charlie's angels is a mess , a bizarre attempt to mix '70s cheesecake with '00s computer-enhanced james bond-ian action . it's infuriating not to be able to shred it to ribbons for being the geek-boy wet dream it clearly was meant to be , but there's just too much wild amusement here to dismiss . in fact , their mission is to induce endocrine overload in viewers who can't get enough of hot chicks doing spinning kicks through the air while wearing curve-hugging clothing . there's no point getting too cerebral about charlie's angels . in fact , if you do decide to see it , it would be wise to check under your seat as you leave to make sure your mind hasn't leaked out of your ear into a puddle on the floor . sure , there are the requisite self-aware nudges to show that it knows not to be taken seriously -- a reference to t . j . hooker : the movie , a gag about overwrought action film acting , etc . -- but it still keeps up a frantic pace so you won't notice how awkwardly made it is . certain action sequences are chopped short , character-building sub-plots stall the film in place and the tone shifts abruptly from moment to moment . whatever 21st century spin the folks involved might want to put on this version of charlie's angels , it's still all about the t&a -- whether it stands for technique & attitude , or bears the cruder , more common meaning . but damned if it still isn't more fun than mission : impossible 2 , or the world is not enough , or virtually any other recent high-tech caper you'd care to name . part of it is how unabashedly over-the-top it all is , from the physics-defying fight sequences to the megaton explosions . part of it is the way the comic relief actually provides comedy , including bill murrays' inimitable bill murray-ness and cameron diaz getting into her ditzy side . part of it is the strange appeal of watching a film that lets women be the james bonds ( including the unapologetic casual sex ) , and comes up with better villains than the bond series has had for some time ( dig that crispin glover ! ) . and yes , a whole lot of it is how it pulls off the neat trick of sending up the series' hair-flipping jiggle appeal while still taking advantage of it . do all the pieces of charlie's angels add up to slick movie-making ? no . in fact , rookie feature film director mcg clearly has a lot to learn about elements beyond slow-motion and near-subliminal edits . he does , however , have a game cast , a competent script , some awesome fight choreography and a willingness to turn anything into a joke . this ain't art , but it ain't the kind of tediously predictable big-budget garbage you usually find at your multiplex , either . this is movie-making heavy on the drew barrymore-hangin'-out-a-window-while-nekkid-fu . scott says check it out . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1542,"starring : zbigniew zamachowski , julie delpy , janusz gajos . screenplay : krzysztof kieslowski and krzysztof piesiewicz . it is understandable that he announced his retirement from filmmaking at this year's cannes film festival where red , the third segment of his three colors trilogy , premiered ; three films in two years is enough to burn anyone out . still , it is a shame to see such a versatile director leave the scene . last year's blue was a marvelous psychological drama ; white is an acidic little comedy . white is also somewhat less satisfying than blue , well-acted and directed but suffering from basic deficiencies in motivation and characterization . zbigniew zamachowski gives a delightful physical performance as the rumpled but sympathetic karol , appearing perpetually bewildered and on the verge of tears . however , he is less successful at conveying karol's transformation into a slick go-getter . like many events in white , the change occurs too quickly , and it seems to be presented as an article of faith that this is something that was always within karol , just requiring the right setting--at least i didn't see it on the screen . even more perplexing is dominique , whose feelings for karol are believably convoluted but who turns into a bizarre creation by the film's conclusion . there is a surreal quality to the events of white's last fifteen minutes , a quality which sabotages any sense of character . the sequence which theoretically explains this change ( featuring an effective use of an all-white screen as an accent ) doesn't , at least not as believably as it should . julie delpy , like zamachowski , nails her character in the beginning of the film , but drifts into something unrecognizable by the final scene . it's unfortunate that the characters are so unfocused , because kieslowski's exploration of equality is intriguingly multi-faceted . most obviously , there is karol's attempt to "" get even "" with dominique , an attempt with unexpectedly successful results . white is full of interesting ideas , more than ten average films put together , but they're just not executed all that smoothly . moments of brilliance shine out in white ; others are dulled by chaotic characterizations .

1544,"starring : guinevere turner , v . s . brodie , t . wendy mcmillan , anastasia sharp , migdalia melendez . screenplay : rose troche & guinevere turner . the problem with nearly every mainstream film dealing with lesbians is that they have been just so * serious * . if you believed what you saw on the screen , you'd think that every lesbian relationship involved a "" fallen "" heterosexual grappling in anguish with her sexual identity . even at their best , such "" love-that-dare-not-speak-its-name "" melodramas painted a picture that just didn't gibe the reality i have seen . what a breath of fresh air go fish is : a low-budget romantic comedy finally showing lesbians having fun and leading day-to-day lives . though uneven and amateurish enough to be occasionally distracting , go fish is mostly a frisky and funny pleasure , playing like a sort of when sally met sally . . . . go fish was a labor of love and a financial nightmare for turner and co-scripter/director rose troche , so it may seem unfair to criticize the erratic film quality and choppy editing . however , many of the rookie mistakes troche makes are difficult to pass off on economics . between scenes , she often inserts self-consciously artsy snippets of flashing lights , folded hands and spinning tops , and they just aren't in synch with the otherwise light-hearted film . it was as though troche wasn't sure she was ever going to get a chance to make a movie again , and thus threw every idea she had into this one , resulting in a somewhat scattered final product . troche is also at the mercy of her mostly non-professional cast , and they in turn are at the mercy of some occasionally very sketchy characters . the best role belongs to turner , an appealing presence with self-effacing humor . she delivers shome sharp lines with a wry wit , and anchors the scenes in which she , evy , daria and daria's amour-du-jour comment on max and ely's relationship . not so fortunate is v . s . brodie , who stumbles her way through a part written more through other characters observations than through anything ely says or does . while i have no problem with the idea that max might see past ely's unconventional looks , i would expect there to be a more interesting personality for her to find there . as underdeveloped as some of the characters might be , they still have plenty of funny things to say . in the film's opening scene , kia leads a class in speculating on what historical figures , celebrities , and even fictional characters might have been lesbians . the "" talking heads "" scenes are particularly entertaining , chief among them a discussion of preferred terms for the female genitalia . and in the film's sweetest and funniest moment , ely practically skips home after a particularly good evening with max . yet as amusing as go fish is , it is not without some frank observations on what it means to be a lesbian in the 1990's . go fish is not without its bumps and flaws , but it is both funny enough and insightful enough to warrant casting a line into its deep waters .

1545,"director : darren aronofsky . mpaa rating : nc-17 ( drug use , sexual situations , nudity , profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 102 minutes . if it was director darren aronofsky's goal to use requiem for a dream as a variation on a clockwork orange's ludivico treatment . . . well , mission accomplished . his adaptation of huber selby , jr . 's novel is a dazzling multi-media assault , a tale of degradation and shattered lives that will make you feel as though you need a brain enema to cleanse your memory of its most disturbing images . aronofsky's singularly inventive visual style , combined with one of the year's most chillingly evocative scores by clint mansell and the kronos quartet , dares you not to look away , lest you miss something potentially extraordinary . requiem for a dream is arresting , compelling and frequently flat-out horrifying . so why isn't it one of the best films of the year , if not _the_ best film ? because for all of aronofsky's stylistic prowess , and all the film's visceral power , this narrative falls into an all-too-common trap : it spells out too much of the subtext , and doesn't trust the viewer to get the point without a good-old fashioned bludgeoning . aronofsky eschews the typical fetishistic shots of injections , substituting rapid-fire montages to represent the characters' respective fixes . there are brilliant moments both when the film is at its most kinetic ( sara's speed-fuelled cleaning jags ) and at its most serene ( harry and marion sharing a tender split-screen moment in which their physical connection is disturbingly disjointed ) . there's style to spare in requiem for a dream , but there's not as much substance as there should be , and what substance there is becomes too blatant in its presentation . similarly , a subtle moment in which sara is given a preferred seat among the women outside her building -- just because she may be on television in the near future -- is underlined by sara's comment on her royal treatment . every time requiem for a dream is on the verge of being about more than its characters' inevitable spiral into agony , it quickly offers the cliff's notes version and moves you along to the next moment of personal hell . and eventually , all those moments of personal hell become wearying . as splendidly acted as requiem for a dream is -- and every one of the four principals is very good , particularly burstyn -- it's ultimately a film that pays far more attention to the things drugs does to these people than what it takes away from them . it becomes such a relentless parade of dignity-destroying acts and physical disintegration that the broadly sketched characterizations vanish in the wake of their misery . it conditions you to feel repulsed by what drugs do to these people without allowing you to feel for them as people . this is spectacularly staged and marvelously performed "" just say no "" melodrama -- reefer madness for the art house set . it's impossible not to get requiem for a dream's message , and nearly impossible not to applaud the messenger . but after 102 minutes , it feels like you've been strapped into a chair while the message imbeds itself into your pried-open eyeballs . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

"" as has been well-reported by entertainment news outlets , co-stars meg ryan and russell crowe got a little thing going while filming proof of life . it's the kind of story that provides publicity a studio just can't buy , with voyeuristic viewers potentially taking the opportunity to watch a filmed record of two attractive stars developing a major league case of the hots for one another . as it happens , the relationship between ryan and crowe's characters is the worst reason to see proof of life . in fact , the filmmakers seem to do everything possible to make that relationship utterly inconsequential . there are two major co-conspirators in the failure of proof of life's romantic angle : the timidity of director taylor hackford , and the casting of meg ryan . the script by tony gilroy does a fine job of setting up cracks in the bowman's marriage , the kind that could easily lead to some straying during a pressure-packed situation . ryan , meanwhile , never develops into a complete character , with a back story that's made up of script assertions rather than performance . in a role like this , opposite a dynamic screen actor like crowe , it becomes obvious that meg ryan is a movie star in a role that demands an actor . while proof of life's major selling point sits there limply in the center of the film , there's plenty of great stuff going on around the perimeter . morse , a superb character actor who seems only to be getting better with age , gets some wonderful scenes as he tries to cope with his situation . there's more great material surrounding the details of terry's profession , including his friendship with a colleague played by david caruso ( in a performance so vivid it just makes you want to cry over his career choices ) . and there's crowe himself , whose charisma boosts the intensity of every scene he's in . as a film about the psychological pressures of retrieving a hostage , proof of life scores . it may seem unfair to drag the actors' personal lives into an evaluation of a film , but it's obvious from what's not on the screen that the film itself was ultimately compromised by those personal lives . it doesn't . the genuine shame is that it's such a strong piece of work in virtually every other respect that it's still worth watching . proof of life will be a more enjoyable experience for you if you go in expecting a thriller rather than an incendiary screen romance -- especially when the filmmakers keep trying to blow out the flames . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1547,"at various points during disney's the emperor's new groove , it becomes apparent that it could have been a mediocre-at-best piece of animated film-making . here there's a significant lack of detail in the background animation ; over there , a gaping hole where a catchy tune might have buoyed the proceedings ; throughout , a narrative that doesn't exactly set the world on fire . yes , it's all pretty tepid stuff -- and then a character will open his mouth , and set you to giggling uncontrolably . after years of watching its animated features soar on various permutations of stunning visuals , engaging story-telling and memorable songs , disney has finally made a film that succeeds almost exclusively on the strength of its vocal performances . and it does so by a fairly narrow margin . bonding and learning of important lessons ensues . in a way , the whole business is quite beneath disney . much of the emperor's new groove feels cobbled together as an afterthought , as though the real a-team mouseke-thinkers were too busy making fantasia 2000 or figuring out how to promote 102 dalmatians . while the character animation is effective , virtually everything else is about as eye-catching as your typical hanna-barbera background . the progression of the story is bland , with only a couple of really good action set pieces to liven things up . not exactly the stuff of which disney animated "" classics "" are made , at least until the voice actors get to strut their stuff . david spade provides the perfect petulant , all-about-me vibe for kuzco , though it certainly helps to be in tune with spade's typical caustic sense of humor . as the villainous yzma , eartha kitt growls her role with such delicious malevolence it boggles the mind that she has never been cast as a disney animated villain before . but the real show-stopper is warburton's kronk , one of those essentially decent lunkhead sidekicks who eventually do their evil bosses more harm than good . the part is a familiar one , but warburton delivers his lines with such a combination of deadpan idiocy and absolute sincerity that nearly every syllable out of kronk's mouth is hilarious . screenwriter david reynolds provides some clever dialogue , but it's not nearly as good as the people who bring it to life . the one weak link in the cast is goodman , though it's not really his fault . pacha is as personality-impaired a character as disney has created in a long time for a central role ( okay , probably since pocahontas ) . he's not exactly the hero , not exactly the comic relief -- he's just the big , good-natured guy necessary to move the plot along . considering the relative blandness of the plot itself , there are all kinds of reasons to suspect that the emperor's new groove should have been a dud . congratulations to spade , kitt and warburton -- and to the casting director -- for giving the film the spark the rest of the creative team couldn't quite manage . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1549,"director : philip kaufman . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , sexual situations , adult themes , profanity , violence ) running time : 123 minutes . as the title character in the people vs . larry flynt , woody harrelson says at one point ( and i paraphrase ) , "" if the first amendment protects a scumbag like me , then it will protect anybody . "" that's the approximate thematic gist playwright doug wright is going for in quills : an exploration of the idea that even free speech at its most extreme and offensive should still be free . it's a worthy enough idea to espouse , and the movie based on wright's quills should have been plenty worthy as well -- if only it weren't so damned self-congratulatory about its position . as splendidly staged as philip kaufman's cinematic version of quills may be , it's ultimately stunted by a text so concerned with making its artistic points that it flops as simple story-telling . but the not-so-good doctor finds that silencing de sade will be no easy matter , as the prolific nobleman is practically compelled to spill his obscene thoughts onto paper . the marquis , we are told , has been so tainted by the world around him that he must spill "" the toxins in his head "" into his stories ; madeleine , who revels in his naughty work , tells coulmier , "" if i wasn't such a bad woman on the page , i'll hazard i couldn't be such a good woman in life . "" quills offers a dozen different defenses of free speech at its most unfettered , including commentary that we must know vice in order to appreciate virtue , and a taunt from the marquis to the abbe : "" are your convictions so fragile that they cannot stand in opposition to mine ? "" every five minutes or so , there's another re-phrasing of the same point in a slightly different way : art is just art , words are just words , and even the most ghastly art and the most ghastly words must be given their table in the marketplace of ideas . a debatable point , to be certain , but the problem isn't so much whether or not one concurs with wright's absolutist interpretation of freedom of speech . the problem with quills is that wright is so intent on hammering his point home that he ignores little matters like fleshing out his characters . winslet and phoenix are effective as the essentially good people aware of their darker impulses , but wright is mostly interested in them as representations of the dark impulses in all of us . and rush , while thoroughly entertaining as the ultimate libertine , never gets at what de sade was ultimately all about as a human being . once you've figured out what wright is saying in quills -- and it doesn't take all that long -- the playing out of the narrative feels like a long walk around in circles . wright does deserve credit for not taking the easiest ways out with his arguments . he shows de sade's work provoking a group of madmen to violent acts , and he doesn't soft-pedal the cruel , petulant de sade himself as a torture artist just to make him more sympathetic as a tortured artist . there are several individually enjoyable scenes in quills , from the "" telephone game "" rendering of one of de sade's tales to the staging of a bawdy play intended to humiliate royer-collard . physically , it's a lovely production to behold . emotionally , it is provocative stuff . but intellectually , it's redundant . it's clear that wright believes even the kind of art that could inspire a columbine massacre must not be suppressed . it's equally clear that he feels pretty good about himself for saying so . ironically , quills probably works best as simple , sensual , prurient-interest entertainment . as a presentation of ideas , it's more thesis than theater . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1550,"screenplay : akiva goldsman and robert getchell . director : joel schumacher . the film adaptation of john grisham's the client is in a unique position . artistically , on the other hand , the expectations are probably much lower , again based on the previous grisham adaptations . grisham on the screen is like grisham on the page : glossy , undemanding , straight-ahead potboilers , perfect for mass consumption . but surprisingly , the client is slightly more than that . even if the whole does not quite equal the sum of its more impressive parts , the client edges out the firm as the best of the three grisham films . the client , like the firm , benefits most from a wealth of solid performances . the scenes in which sarandon and jones tangle are masterful , sparks of raw intelligence flying between the two gifted performers , making it regrettable that there aren't more . newcomer brad renfro actually has far more screen time than either of his big-name co-stars , and he is occasionally very good , particularly when showing a bit of an edge . the best performance , however , might be that of mary- louise parker as mark's mother . in many ways it is a better written part than any of the three leads , rich and complex , and parker is wonderful in a scene-stealing supporting role similar to holly hunter and david strathairn in the firm . there is so much good acting going on in the client ( aside from anthony lapaglia , whose cartoonish mafioso does everything but grab his crotch ) that it's easy to overlook what a hum-drum thriller it is . this isn't true of the first half hour , where director joel schumacher keeps the tension notched up high . then , as grisham plots tend to do , the client's sputters out like a released balloon . the climactic showdown is abrupt , silly and very unsatisfying , an appropriate wrap-up to a sluggish second hour . it almost seems as though schumacher realized that the suspense elements were the least interesting , and did only what was necessary for resolution . in fact , the client is much more effective as a character study than it is as a thriller . but that relationship is a bit rushed , and while both the firm and the pelican brief overstayed their welcome , the client might have benefited from an additional ten or fifteen minutes of character development . it might have made the maudlin closing scene between reggie and mark more tolerable . still , the client's first- rate cast carries it through its many lulls . provided you aren't heading to see the client expecting a pulse-pounding thriller , its possible you could be in for a pleasant surprise .

1552,"screenplay : david twohy . director : deran sarafian . most of the time , i see a new movie on its opening weekend , and it's not just so that my reviews can be fairly fresh . such was not the case with terminal velocity , which had the chance to accumulate a mountain of negative response in the two weeks between its opening and my screening . it's difficult to preduct how those pre-conceptions will affect my own reaction . in this case , they allowed me to be pleasantly surprised . terminal velocity is frenetic and uneven , but it has a certain bone-headed charm thanks to charlie sheen's improbably dense hero . sheen plays richard "" ditch "" brody , a skydiving instructor with something of a reckless streak . the plot of terminal velocity is not exactly what you would call inspired ; it's basically classic hitchcock crossed with classic james bond . the plot's few twists and turns are spelled out in huge letters from the outset , and a bit clumsy in the execution . equally distracting is a tone which careens from brutal to near slapstick in moments , making for a schizophrenic experience which isn't as purely enjoyable as it might be . director deran sarafian drives the action forward relentlessly , which is usually an ideal choice for a film of this genre , but often seems merely hyperactive here . terminal velocity sometimes feels like a cockroach race -- moving fast , but in no particular direction . its saving graces are the characterizations and interaction of charlie sheen and nastassja kinski . sheen's ditch brody is just a handful of brain celss removed from his goofball hot shots ! persona , but it's a character that comes off as extremely refreshing in an action thriller . rather than being either inordinately brilliant or dumber than virtually everyone in the audience , ditch is just simple . he is quite entertaining in scenes where he is infuriated by kinski's references to his dim-wittedness , but he maintains a kind of affable puppy-dog eagerness to please . it's a simple gesture , but funny because it's clear this is no rocket scientist we're dealing with . that rescue , a wildly inventive stunt , is certainly terminal velocity's highlight . it's a gag worthy of the best bond films , and it sends terminal velocity off on a note of high energy . but it's not an isolated moment . terminal velocity is full of well-staged action sequences , and twohy's dialogue is rich with fine one-liners . though it sometimes seems a bit too busy and scattershot for its own good , it's still a perfectly enjoyable no-brainer worth a few solid laughs . "
1553,"is a light-hearted , quirky romantic romp about a date-from-hell . it most decidedly is not . it is a dark , disturbing and almost painfully honest character study which will have many viewers shifting uncomfortably in their chairs . the sensational performances of karen sillas and tom noonan should have added up to a sensational film , but they don't quite . in adapting his two person stage play , noonan manages both to under-direct and to over-direct , sacrificing much of the story's potential entertainment value for a more serious tone which simply doesn't ring quite as true . the first half of what happened was . . . , which establishes the characters through the mundane , is by far its most effective . it's a beautiful and sensitive performance , and jackie's genuineness provides a perfect counterpoint to michael's intellectual reserve , as he tries to maintain the upper hand through sarcasm without even knowing it . it soon becomes clear that jackie is far more perceptive than michael , and as the power dynamic shifts , michael crumbles . the development of this shift through the dinner is fascinating , if almost too understated . however , noonan is not content to deliver a sort of my dinner date with andre , and it is when the script takes an abrupt left turn into psychodrama that the film falters . noonan simply takes the scene too far ; children's voices whisper in the background , the camera shoots through the windows of a dollhouse , and sillas is lit with flickering candles like a voodoo priestess . the self-conscious arsty-ness of noonan's direction takes a serious scene and makes it almost a self-parody . michael's big breakdown is also played far too broadly . eventually begins too feel extremely scripted , losing the pinpoint honesty which had been its strength . is that it is much more interesting when its observations about human interaction are inspiring nervous laughter than when they are supposed to be inspiring serious contemplation . stories based on big emotional confrontations between characters are tricky to transfer from the stage to the screen . noonan only got it half right .

1554,"starring : kurt russell , james spader , jaye davidson . director : roland emmerich . stargate is a movie from out of a time warp , and i'm not just talking about the plot . stargate feels a lot like many of those films : overblown , underwritten , yet still moderately entertaining . perhaps it was the sense of nostalgia it inspired in me , but stargate offered just enough to keep me interested , despite all of its bombast and unfulfilled promise . for the first half hour , stargate seems to be pretty comfortably on the right track , with a solid premise . spader in particular is quite appealing , playing the perfect slightly dazed academic ; the early scenes in which he shows up the military scientists are low-key and quite a lot of fun . in fact , for all its $50 million scale , spader may be the best thing stargate has going for it . unfortunately , he makes kurt russell look like a large piece of plywood by comparison . as such he fits right in with the rest of the advance team , an interchangeable collection of macho grunts . once we get to the other side of the stargate , things are still wildly uneven , and we're not even talking about those plausibility questions that plague most science fiction fare . the real issue is that as good as stargate looks , it's awfully slow-moving . the sets and costume design are impressive , and even the desert sandscapes have a certain beauty to them . but stargate falls victim to its attempts at creating a fully-realized alternative civilization . it's a nice touch that they don't speak the "" miracle english "" common to alien civilizations , but it makes the soldiers' interactions with them extremely tedious . the fascination of some of the younger ones with the human aliens is believable , but a scene involving one of them reacting to kurt russell's lighter as magic is as old as the hills . it's as though director and co-scripter roland emmerich paid so much attention to cultural detail that he missed the big picture--providing a truly engaging story . the climax of stargate is a major improvement , full of energy and creativity . it's a shame that jaye davidson's ra is such a boring villain , gliding along through the ship making imperious pronouncements in a voice bearing a frightening similarity to that of jabba the hut . there is really very little in ra's role except ordering guards around , so the threat isn't nearly as threatening as it might be . the bottom line , though , is that even as i was thinking about how ridiculous some of the resolutions were ( including final decisions made by both russell's and spader's characters ) , i realized that i had enjoyed myself . and for a matinee price , i generally don't ask for much more .

1555,"screenplay : kevin wade and chris conrad . director : ivan reitman . in 1988 , arnold schwarzenegger , danny devito and ivan reitman set the standard for "" high concept "" with their comic vehicle twins . in hollywood pitch-meeting parlance , it could be reduced to five words-- "" schwarzenegger and devito are twins "" --and proved that sometimes a simple idea and the right talent could add up to $100 million even with a paper-thin script . and in a limited sense , it works . junior is so simple and gently directed that the warm performances of emma thompson and schwarzenegger manage to struggle through a script that always goes for the easy gag , and even then can't make most of them particularly funny . the impregnation is a success , but of course complications ensue . this is not hollywood's first attempt at a pregnant man story , and the disastrous first attempt ( the joan rivers-directed billy crystal vehicle rabbit test ) would not seem to inspire eagerness to give the premise another try . the joke in junior , of course , isn't just that a man is pregnant ; it's that the man in question is arnold schwarzenegger . schwarzenegger's choices of roles in the last several years have demonstrated a mastery of his own image , as he alternates action blockbusters with against-type comedies , and he has proved remarkably adept at both . as limited as his acting skills may be , he is usually very likable , and junior is no exception . those familiar with thompson only from her branagh/shakespeare and merchant/ivory efforts will be quite pleasantly surprised by her goofy performance in junior . her dianna , a clumsy and socially inept scientist , is the perfect match for schwarzenegger's hesse , and thompson's delightful moments of physical comedy make her scenes with arnold very appealing . that's really what junior has going for it : appealing performers at their most appealing . most of the jokes are based on the obvious incongruities of schwarzenegger in the family way--his appearance in a prosthetic belly ; his emotional response to a sappy kodak commercial ; his delivery of lines like , "" my nipples are very sensitive . "" and it's only because schwarzenegger seems to be having so much fun that any of it works . other bits , including the obligatory scene of a baby with urine streaming down its leg , are too trite for any amount of good will to make them work . the script , credited to kevin wade and chris conrad , is full of missed opportunities and silliness instead of any real inventiveness . frank langella , who was so good in the reitman-directed dave last year , is woefully underused as the obligatory villain , and gets the most obvious comeuppance available . perhaps that's the word that defines junior best : obvious . this is terrain we've all seen many , many times before . but the cast of junior is so engaging that it feels like we're seeing that terrain in a very comfortable car , in the company of old friends .

1556,"screenplay : paul attanasio . director : barry levinson . you know that angry white male we've all been hearing so much about since the november election ? well , i've just figured it out : he's michael douglas . ever since fatal attraction in 1987 , douglas has seemed to be there every time a film exploded into an infuriating zeitgeist phenomenon , and douglas himself has mastered the role of the somewhat-less-than-innocent victim . what you don't have is anything nearly as controversial as it might first appear to be . while it is well-paced and generally entertaining , it tries so hard to be everything for everyone that it misses the chance to be genuinely incendiary . tom ultimately resists temptation , but meredith is not pleased . those familiar with other michael crichton works ( jurassic park , rising sun ) will not be stunned to learn that the characters in disclosure are stick figures ; i somehow suspect that if crichton could figure out a plot that didn't require human beings , he'd jump on it in a minute . it's dense with twists , turns and intrigue , perhaps too dense for a screen adaptation ever to cover thoroughly enough . because there is so much ground to cover , director barry levinson keeps the film moving like a rocket , and it could leave some viewers struggling to keep up . while there is very little he can do with meredith's character , he does give tom a slightly shadier personality so that his experience becomes something of a comeuppance . he also creates some marveous dialogue which may be disclosure's strongest asset . comic dennis miller is also sharp as one of tom's co-workers , but i suspect that many of his best lines were his own creations . attanasio's work is efficient and clever , and it makes disclosure engaging most of the time . unfortunately , attanasio also appears to have been given orders to give every possible side of the story equal time , and it is when disclosure becomes a high school debate that it becomes tiresome . crichton's novel was unapologetic about the role-reversal in the sexual harrassment story , since to him it was simply a plot device in a corporate thriller . the film , on the other hand , both tries to be * about * sexual harrassment and to avoid appearing as reactionary as crichton , and gives everyone a chance to make a speech . in a story as tightly constructed as disclosure , the dueling pontifications are a real time drain . disclosure is a slick , well- photographed film , and it's nice to see levinson directing a winner after the twin bombs toys and jimmy hollywood . still , it could have been much more effective had it spent less time chewing its nails over how politically correct it wanted to be .

1557,"screenplay : andy breckman and michael leeson . director : fred schepisi . a movie like i . q . is like a souffle . when you're trying to mix whimsy , romance , comedy and ( of all things ) physics together , the whole recipe can collapse under its own weight without the right chef . director fred schepisi made all the right decisions in 1987's roxanne , a film that could have been either cloying or tedious in the wrong hands . i . q . isn't quite as successful as roxanne , but it is far more entertaining than it has any right to be . while it's rarely laugh-out-loud funny , it's pleasant , low-key and consistently charming . it's not easy to describe exactly why i . q . works , because in many ways it's extremely simple and predictable . there are the standard complications , and none of them are particularly hilarious . i think i . q . 's greatest strength may be that it uses its premise to perfection . einstein isn't part of the story simply as high-concept gag ; love really does become a kind of physics formula , and its incorporation into the story is delightful . matthau is a marvelous einstein , a gentle matchmaker with a twinkle in his eye . the running commentary they provide on philosophy , science and love is a goofy little trick that turns them into an almost fantastical greek chorus . it's exactly what schepisi was able to do with roxanne : keep the tone light and coax fine supporting performances out of every last supporting character . of course , a romantic comedy is generally only as successful as the chemistry between its stars , so how do ryan and robbins fare together ? quite well , and that's mostly because screenwriters andy breckman and michael leeson take their time bringing them together . this is far from ryan's best work -- i thought she was coasting much of the time -- but a mediocre ryan is still worth a lot in a role like this . robbins , on the other hand , turns in one of his most appealing performances yet . many of his previous roles have been one-note jobs , either simpletons or sleazes , but ed is a warm and engaging character which shows that robbins has a bright future as a romantic leading man . their scenes together may not set the screen on fire , but they are comfortable enough together that the smiles just keep coming . i didn't expect much from i . q . , and it really didn't deliver all that much . i just had fun , and i left with a smile . it doesn't take a genius to realize that achievement is worth a compliment . "
1558,"every time a film based on actual events or including real historical figures appears , it seems that there are scholars stepping over each other to decry its lack of faithfulness to historical fact . whether it's shoeless joe jackson batting right handed in field of dreams , or the condensed time line in the recent quiz show , or any of a hundred other possible examples , there seems to be a widespread refusal to allow film dramas to be exactly that : dramatizations of real events , no more documentary than the re-creations on "" america's most wanted . "" as a moviegoer , my only question is , "" does it succeed as drama ? "" the answer for immortal beloved is that while it is sometimes quite enjoyable , it is better experienced than analyzed . perhaps the best , if most precious , way to describe immortal beloved is as ludwig von-adeus . writer/director rose has mounted a sumptuous production , gloriously scored with the subject's compositions and intended to bring some humanity to a figure most often seen as a wildly coiffed bust on a marble pedestal . and he manages to deliver some marvelous sequences : the sea of mourners greeting beethoven's casket ; his deafness revealed to an audience as he attempts to conduct an orchestra ; the beautifully staged premiere of the 9th symphony , as the "" ode to joy "" accompanies flashbacks to beethoven's difficult childhood . rose manages to wed sound to image in that manner that is uniquely cinematic , evocative without ever lapsing into pretentiousness . as successful as immortal beloved is as a sensory experience , it is not nearly as successful at establishing character . for better or worse , amadeus managed to make mozart a character we could relate to ; immortal beloved does not quite manage that feat with beethoven . but the fragmented nature of the narrative allows us only unsatisfying glimpses of the man beethoven might have been , and even rose's tendency to film oldman in medium and long shots contributes to this distancing effect . rose's choice of the "" immortal beloved "" letter might have seemed perfect as a jumping off point for examining beethoven as a character , but too often it just doesn't work . when the film stops dead for schindler to talk to one woman or another about beethoven , we expect some insight , and there just isn't all that much . though i have focused on many of immortal beloved's failings , i should make it clear that on the whole , i enjoyed it , particularly in the moment i was watching it . music coordinator georg solti fills the theater with grand music , and those scenes which simply feature music accompanying rose's images are quite powerful . but afterwards , i realized what that made immortal beloved : a somewhat ineffectual plot connecting some exceedingly well-made music videos .

1559,"screenplay : susan shilliday and bill wittliff . director : edward zwick . legends of the fall is a big , dumb bassett hound of a movie . it stares at you with big sad eyes , slobbers all over you and practically begs you to like it . it's muddled , bombastic , and often gets by purely on style points , yet for some reason , inexplicably , it also manages to be occasionally entertaining . i could spend days listing all the things that are wrong with legends of the fall , and still i'd be left with the fact that something worked . radiating the kind of charisma that screen actors just don't seem to have any more , he single-handedly makes legends of the fall watchable . for about half an hour , legends of the fall is more than simply passable ; it's a grand , beautifully filmed family drama with tremendous potential . all the performances are perfectly tuned , the interactions between the brothers are convincing and the story is well-paced . a film which had been moving along at a confident and leisurely pace suddenly goes into a dead sprint that seems to get faster and faster , until by the end i felt quite relieved that it was over . fortunately , the film's technical credits are spectacular . director edward zwick scored a successful screen melodrama with glory , and he appears to use many of the same tricks in legends . in fact , the war scenes here might easily have been the same scenes from glory with different uniforms added by computer . the score is by james horner , and as usual he lays the strings on thick as syrup , but it works in legends . as the narrative becomes more and more stream of consciousness , the look and sound of legends of the fall actually seem to improve . for all that , the best thing that zwick puts on the screen is pitt . he is asked to slog through several melodramatic moments in legends of the fall , but his dark intensity keeps them from being as overblown as they might have been , and he may be as convincing a crier as any male actor in many years . then zwick comes through with an exceptional final fifteen minutes , including a retribution montage which might strike some as a bit too reminiscent of the godfather films yet works in its own right . legends of the fall is by no stretch of the imagination great filmmaking , and occasionally it's flat-out silly . however , when you put an ascending star in an old-fashioned western epic , anything is possible . and for legends of the fall , it's just enough .

1560,"screenplay : laurice elehwany & rick copp and bonnie turner & terry turner . director : betty thomas . it is official now : i have become everything that i despise . i am of a certain age where my youth has become a marketing tool , re-packaged and returned to me for nostalgic consumption . but those attempts to this point ( the beverly hillbillies , the flintstones ) have basically left me unmoved . the brady bunch . . . now , there's a different story . i grew up with them , and i remember their dopey antics with an inexplicable affection . so the upshot is , they finally got to me . the brady bunch movie is a movie that most likely was put together by chimps , and i had fun anyway . i think any discussion of the brady bunch movie must begin with this statement : you had to be there . familiarity with the series , whether in first run or its endless incarnation in reruns , is essential , since the film is composed almost entirely of bits and pieces of plots from the series . when the audience laughs at marcia being hit in the face by a football , or peter's cracking voice , or greg's attempt to turn himself into rock star johnny bravo , it isn't because any of these situations are inherently funny ; in fact , they are really fairly inane . but they are so familiar , so much a part of the fabric of growing up in america at a particular time , that watching the brady bunch movie is like re-discovering an old toy . even if you realize that it was sort of a stupid toy , you are still going to play with it , and smile while you're doing it . the brady bunch movie was going to sink or swim on the basis of casting , and there are both successes and failures . shelly long has florence henderson's mannerisms down pat as carol , and gary cole is a hoot as he pronounces brady platitudes with a deadpan solemnity . the dead ringer award goes to christine taylor , who looks and sounds so much like original marcia maureen mccormick that it is truly frightening . less impressive are jennifer elise cox , whose slightly unhinged jan is too reminiscent of melanie hutsell's "" saturday night live "" characterization of jan , and henriette mantel , who does a version of housekeeper alice which includes pratfalls and , inexplicably , a leather bustier . there are about equal parts homage and parody in the brady bunch movie , and both have their moments , but what surprised me most was the way the film managed to recall a simpler time without mockery . make no mistake , the brady bunch movie is occasionally quite sluggish , and required about a thimbleful of creativity . at the same time , it made me wistful not only for a piece of my youth , but also for an era when families were functional , communities seemed closer , and "" have a nice day "" was something people actually meant .

1561,"i have this idea for a screenplay , and so do about a million other people in the los angeles area alone . the form seems so accessible--three acts , 120 pages and a couple of meaty characters--that the allure is easy to see . every once in a while , one of these ideas will end up on the screen , and every once in an even greater while , the writer will get the chance to direct his own story . this can be both a good thing and a bad thing for a novice ; a single vision can be unifying or it can be self-indulgent . alan jacobs' nina takes a lover is an extremely intriguing concept , and a handsomely made film . i just kept thinking that it needed another hand in the production to point out some major distractions . on one level , nina takes a lover works wonderfully , and that is in the examination of nina's character . gradually , however , this somewhat bland nina makes sense . her thrilling experimentation with her lover is sometimes uncomfortably to watch ; she asks him challenging questions and expects answers , something that apparently is not possible with her husband , and she feels more adventurous , more sexy . the problem with this very affecting story is that it is trapped in an awkward structure . nina takes a lover has the confessional feel of a stage play , and it might have worked better in that medium . the segments involving the discussions with the reporter heighten the staginess , pull the audience away from the more interesting events of nina's affair , and , perhaps worst of all , suggest a rookie director resorting to telling you what he couldn't figure out how to show visually . the sub-plot involving the affair between nina's friend and her annoying lover is similarly unnecessary , adding only some silly comic relief . even that adjustment would not have addressed jacobs' sometimes distracting over-direction . there are moments when scenes are spliced together in a manner which is too self-consciously artsy and draws too much attention to the strange cutaways , as though jacobs didn't trust the ability of his narrative to hold an audience's attention . the editing is also quite clumsy on occasion , the choice of who is in a shot somewhat arbitrary in appearance , and many of the performances pitched at a level of hyper-seriousness which veers dangerously close to melodrama . still , nina takes a lover is a thoughtful , atmospheric film which tells a great story . if alan jacobs the director could serve alan jacobs the writer better , he could have a bright future .

1562,"starring : dustin hoffman , rene russo , morgan freeman , cuba gooding jr . , kevin spacey , donald sutherland . screenplay : laurence dworet and robert roy pool . director : wolfgang petersen . you've got to love it when hollywood producers find themselves scrambling to be the first out of the blocks with an idea . though its conventional action climax doesn't fulfill the promise of a gripping first hour , it's still a satisfying popcorn thriller . the first half of outbreak , which actually deals with the spread of the disease , is as tense an hour as i have spent at the movies in a long time . director wolfgang petersen makes some great decisions filming scenes like a tour through the army's medical facility , which moves ominously from labs studying relatively benign viruses to those studying the bad boys . there is also a wickedly funny moment when an infected man sneezes in a movie theater , and we watch particles flying through the air into other people's mouths . what eventually becomes clear is that petersen's direction is orders of magnitude better than the script from which he is working . the attempts at humor are frequently limp , the performances ( except those by space and gooding ) perfunctory and the characters of the standard , one-dimensional action film variety . and those aren't the only elements that warrant comparison to standard action films , as the conclusion becomes not a down-to-the-wire hunt for a cure in the lab , but a down-to-the-wire helicopter chase , or rather several down-to-the-wire helicopter chases . the sequences are exciting and well-filmed , but they don't belong in this movie any more than a u-boat battle would have belonged in schindler's list . i have a personal beef with outbreak as well , namely that it relies so much on government conspiracy theories . the prospect of a deadly disease wreaking havoc is powerful enough without resorting to paranoia-mongering , and i have yet to see much evidence that any really big secret can be kept in the talk show age , let alone for thirty years as is the case in outbreak . frankly , it's sloppy plotting , and indicative of outbreak's roots as part of a race to be first rather than best . for one hour , outbreak keeps the tension high , but petersen could have done much more with a script just a re-write or two more polished .

1563,"muriel's wedding presents me with a critical poser : what do you do with a movie when there was only one thing about a movie that you liked , but you liked that one thing a * lot * ? i mean , * really * liked it a lot . muriel's wedding is a truly disjointed effort , bouncing from slapstick comedy to depressing domestic drama , but its lead character is a marvelous creation , played with love and sensitivity by toni collette . i was always interested in what might happen to her , but i was frequently disappointed by what happened around her . does that one great piece outweigh all the other less effective pieces ? in a word , yes . . . but just barely . here is what is right with muriel's wedding : toni collette , who walks the fine line between making muriel sympathetic and making her pathetic . she does the most with her expressive mouth , as her bouts of giddiness cause her to burst into a huge toothy smile , frequently with her tongue stuck out through them . it is a marvelous piece of work , made all the more impressive because she never tries to inject any irony into muriel's decidedly un-liberated dreams . here is what is wrong with muriel's wedding : muriel is stuck in an episodic story which doesn't add up to all that much . then the switch to sydney brings a tragic turn which seems really inappropriate , followed by a bride-for-hire section again focused on comedy . finally , there is yet another tragedy , and a decision by muriel for which the justification doesn't seem quite right . it is often difficult to get caught up in muriel's story , because it takes so many detours . she is also surrounded by characters who are mostly paper-thin by comparison . griffiths has some nice moments as the brassy rhonda , and jeanie dryden has a couple of heart-breaking scenes as muriel's beaten-down-by-life mother . but bill hunter is merely loud and slightly oily as muriel's father , and sophie lee leads a group of stereotypically catty barbie dolls who snub muriel . i can understand the attraction--muriel is a splendidly crafted character , acted with a grace that made me care about her life . she deserved something more cohesive than this jittery wedding .

1565,"screenplay : charles edward pogue , from a story by pogue and patrick read johnson . director : rob cohen . for my money , the best joke in dragonheart is one which probably was unintentional , and which works on a level entirely outside the world of the film . the joke is that , once draco speaks , bowen isn't instantly aware that this is the dragon he has been seeking for those twelve years . even after that long , you'd think sean connery's voice would be recognizable . of course , that is exactly why connery was chosen to give voice to the wise , crafty , wrongly-accused draco . it is one of the most distinctive voices in film , a rumbling burr which can be commanding , whimsical , regal or intimate at any given time , and it allows dragonheart to pull off an unexpected trick : you spend as much time listening to the dragon as you do watching it . draco is a marvelous creation by industrial light and magic , fluid and expressive , with a thoroughly unique look and style of movement , and it would have been easy enough to let it be a flashy showpiece . for a big-budget summer fantasy , dragonheart is really a film of smaller charms like the winning characterization of draco , like the goofy monk/would-be troubador ( peter postlethwaite ) who takes it upon himself to chronicle bowen's exploits , like david thewlis' snarling , reptilian villain . but there is something ever so slightly askew in director rob cohen's pacing which prevents dragonheart from taking off into a level of pure enjoyability . none of the relationships ( bowen and draco , bowen and einon , bowen and a feisty damsel played by dina meyer ) ever really click , the battle scenes are serviceable but perfunctory , and there are moments of dark ages-meets-new age mysticism which are played with an almost cloying straightness ( particularly the dewy-eyes-heavenward finale which i have seen in enough spielberg and spielberg-clone films to last me a lifetime ) . on one level , dragonheart is a rather silly and simplistic fairy tale , with a good knight , an evil king , a damsel in distress , swords and sorcery . yet there is an interesting twist to charles edward pogue's script , a redemption story involving bowen's motivations for his dragon-dispensing activities . that makes bowen a complicated hero for an action-fantasy ; that also makes dennis quaid all wrong . quaid's sly grin has carried him far , but the reason it hasn't carried him farther is that he's never convincing when he is supposed to be in a bad mood -- the wrinkled-nosed grimace which passes for quaid's "" angry face "" always look like the put-on anger of someone who is just about to burst into laughter . as a result , the rounded character of pogue's script is flattened on the screen , and ends up seeming considerably less vibrant than his animated co-star . for all its flaws , i was surprised how far dragonheart went on the strength of that one character . toy story proved that an audience could cheer for a character generated on a hard-drive , and draco is such a character . his plight in dragonheart is probably the only one which really connects , and it connects because he has both dignity and -- dare i say it -- humanity . without sean connery lending an air of nobility , dragonheart is yet another good-looking but empty summer spectacle ; with connery , it is a bit more fun , a bit more involving , and a bit more familiar .

1566,"screenplay : gerald dipego . director : jon turtletaub . jon turtletaub has a quality as a director which seems to be fairly uncommon lately : patience . he had surprise successes with his last two films , 1993's cool runnings and last year's while you were sleeping , and generally those successes were attributed to the disney underdog formula and sandra bullock's rising star , respectively . while those factors certainly played a significant role , i also believe that audiences appreciated a style which told simple stories simply . turtletaub's direction gave you the impression that he felt he was doing his job best if he stood back , allowed his narrative to unfold , and didn't draw attention to himself . that is a refreshing perspective in an era of music video auteurs , but apparently it also can be taken a bit too far . phenomenon finds turtletaub bringing his leisurely manner to a story which , somewhere along the line , needed a bit more energy . i had feared that phenomenon would be yet another tiresome spin on "" benevolent stranger among us "" tales like e . t . , starman and last year's odious powder . the latter was an example of the worst kind , the kind of film whose sole purpose seems to be to make us feel better about ourselves for being so much more understanding than the oppressive , narrow-minded cowards in the film . there are whispers of that theme in phenomenon , but screenwriter gerald dipego's story is much more focused on george's reaction to the changes in himself than on the reaction of others to those changes . the moments when phenomenon does begin to feel like a "" benevolent stranger "" film are rare , but they are also rather telling . the villainous feds and scientists are only bit players , not really serving to drive the narrative , and the "" mob "" is more like a rather insistent group of autograph-seekers . turtletaub seems uncomfortable with such dramatic devices , and his sense of restraint is admirable . the problem is that he and dipego really don't provide much in place of those devices to generate conflict . it's a perfectly sweet romance , but it underscores the lack of passion in phenomenon ; the big moment between george and lace has her washing and cutting his hair . a film like phenomenon demands more moments of catharsis , opportunities to feel deeply for the plight of the hero . turtletaub banks on the rosy glow of phedon papamichael's cinematography , thomas newman's jaunty score and the fine performances of his cast ( including a lovably eccentric forest whitaker ) to generate the good will needed to carry phenomenon across the finish line . they carry it remarkably far , but as phenomenon neared the two hour mark , i began to wish turtletaub had gone for a bit less serenity and a bit more urgency .

1567," it's not showgirls  one trailer for striptease bluntly announces , capping off a marketing campaign which may be the first in recent memory to attempt to convince the movie-going public that a new film is _nothing_ like a previous film . sure , it works the other way all the time , thanks to pre-fabricated critical blurbs like "" this year's forrest gump "" or reminders of the director's previous successes , but the stink of showgirls is such that it threatens to contaminate anything featuring a pelvis and a pole . of course , if you remembered that writer-director andrew bergman is behind such comedic gems as the in-laws , the freshman and honeymoon in vegas , you'd know not to expect showgirls . the real question is whether you'd expect striptease , a film as inconsistent in its tone as it is occasionally hilarious . moore received the surprising sum of $12 . 5 million to bump-and-grind her way through striptease , and at the very least the producers should take solace in the fact that she picked up dancing a heck of a lot faster than she has picked up this whole acting thing . there is something both smug and overly earnest about moore's standard screen pose , as though she never wanted there to be any doubt that she felt deeply about whatever her predicament might be , but also that nothing could stop her if she set her mind to it . in striptease , that is a major problem . this is supposed to be a frisky comedy , but moore's deadly serious performance acts like ankle weights on a swimmer . there are scenes between her and armand assante which seem to come from a second-rate tv-movie -- "" baring her soul : the erin grant story . "" that's a real shame , because there are plenty of moments in striptease where bergman's wonderfully weird sense of humor gets to shine through . burt reynolds is completely over the top as dilbeck , a pathetic , fetishistic drunkard who coats himself in vaseline and sniffs erin's dryer lint before addressing a young christians' conference , and there is something improbably enjoyable about the way reynolds doesn't even pretend to modulate his performance . bergman makes fine use of oddball supporting characters , and seasons striptease liberally with his trademark unpredictability , like a priceless scene during the film's climax involving erin's daughter , two well-endowed dancers and a jump-rope . there are plenty of laughs in striptease , enough to make it moderately entertaining , but the reason striptease isn't a better movie is that they're the wrong _kind_ of laughs for the material . based on carl hiaasen's novel , the story demands a darker edge in its political satire , a sense of irony that the topless dancer is one of the few characters in the film with any morals . that simply isn't andrew bergman's style ; his comedy may be wild , but it's always good-natured . when burt reynolds' congressman is as absurd a character as the general played by richard libertini in the in-laws , it's tough to extract any biting commentary . the result is a film which is moving in several different directions at once : the source material is trying to make it dark , bergman is trying to make it silly , and moore is trying to make it serious . when it's silly , striptease is super , but a lot of the time it's not clear _what_ striptease is . except , of course , that it's _not_ showgirls .

1568,"screenplay : fran walsh , peter jackson . director : peter jackson . all those who worried that peter jackson's first big studio film would be a sell-out , please step forward to receive your slaps on the wrist . yes , it is true that many independent and international directors have found that their first steps into hollywood left something foul on the bottom of their shoes ( see kevin smith's mallrats , lee tamahori's mulholland falls or john dahl's unforgettable for just the most recent examples ) . jackson's direction is still in top form in the frighteners , a comedy-thriller which , amazingly , works as both . unfortunately , his story and casting choices are not quite up to the task . it's a cozy little arrangement , but it soon becomes clear that there are other supernatural goings on in fairwater . robert zemeckis acted as executive producer of the frighteners , and if you remember his death becomes her , you will have a good idea of what to expect . the visual effects are wild and entertaining , and sometimes decidedly creepy , like an ectoplasmic face which slowly drips down a tombstone . hartman character from full metal jacket as a ghost running a very tight graveyard . the first half of the frighteners is a feast for those with a warped sense of humor , particularly those who have no problem with the idea of the decomposing judge enjoying . . . ummm . . . relations with a mummy in an egyptian museum exhibit . the main problem with the second half , quite surprisingly , turns out _not_ to be the shift from comedy to horror ; in fact , it's not so much a shift as a gradual build-up . bizarre comedy is a part of the frighteners throughout , but the suspense elements become ever more significant , until the conclusion becomes a sometimes rather bloody confrontation between frank and a pair of killers including a wonderfully unhinged dee wallace stone . jackson knows how to make an audience giggle and shiver at the same time , and it all blends into one creepy funhouse ride . no , the problem , quite simply is michael j . fox , or rather the decision to include a sub-plot for which fox is really unsuited . other characters keep telling frank -- and us -- that he is haunted by that event , but fox never manages to make frank seem like anything more than a happily sleazy con man . his attempts at showing emotional turmoil are sadly superficial ; i don't think i've ever seen someone look as thoroughly unconvincing while a glycerine tear rolled down his cheek . the back story for frank is just one of many bits and pieces which jackson and co-writer fran walsh pile onto the frighteners , making it feel like just that -- bits and pieces . with serial killers , gun-toting ghosts , lunatic g-men , snooping reporters and love interests all running around , the frighteners sometimes gets far too busy for its own good . by the time we get to a finale which includes visions of the afterlife ( both the good and bad version ) , it actually seems just plain silly . peter jackson has a welcome quality in a director , which is that he always wants to keep his audience on its toes , never quite knowing what to expect , and he is ready to entertain them any way he knows how . the frighteners is ultimately a satisfying ride which shows that hollywood hasn't shaken the life out of jackson ; now jackson needs to shake some of the loose ends out of his scripts . "
1569,"for all the talk about how safe and predictable hollywood film-making has become in recent years ( and well-deserved talk it has been ) , i think the independents have been getting a bit lazy as well . the big studios may try to duplicate the formulas of their blockbusters , but the small distributors are just as eager to duplicate the successes within their own ranks , which is why you see a lot of two kinds of film at your local art house : talky generational relationship comedies , and gritty , violent capers . many cinephiles find the former particularly annoying , but i have grown more tired of the attitude-heavy but substance-light films which worship at the altar of tarantino and turn out sour garbage like things to do in denver when you're dead . the big squeeze is a nice idea for a spin on that trend , an unspectacular but surprisingly sunny film noir -- a film blanc , if you will . i suppose that on a basic plot level not much separates the big squeeze from those same gritty , violent capers i criticized en masse . it includes sex , greed , double-crosses and characters with a certain in-your-face quirkiness , and all have an uncomfortable familiarity . what director and writer marcus deleon understands is that a change in tone can make for an entirely different story , and the big squeeze is a film which always seems to be more inviting than ominous -- jacques haitkin's cinematography is bright and cheery most of the time , mark mothersbaugh provides a bouncy score , and the characters are generally likeable . that little trick impressed me , and it is characteristic of the minor pleasures which allow the big squeeze to overcome its familiar story arc and deliberate pacing . part of what makes the big squeeze fun to watch is that benny's plan is based on completely mistaken assumptions about the other people involved -- neither tanya nor jesse is as obsessed with the money as he is , and henry may actually be _more_ obsessed with it . i wish deleon had been content with a silly subversion of noir conventions , because his attempts at more thematic depth fall somewhat flat . that is partly the result of a listless performance by lara flynn boyle , who gives tanya a flaccid personality which doesn't seem to warrant so much fascination by so many men . but for all its unevenness , the big squeeze provides an unexpected twist to a genre in which guns and gloom generally carry the day . in this case , it is a pleasant surprise to find not a single bullet fired , and every character experiencing some kind of happy ending . apparently deleon prefers to make love , not noir .

1570,"starring : whoopi goldberg , gerard depardieu , haley joel osment . screenplay : alvin sargent . director : norman jewison . it is a frustrating thing to watch a high concept get in the way of a perfectly good film . in bogus , there is a scene in which the jimmy stewart classic harvey is showing on a television , and the reference makes you suspect that someone went into a pitch meeting to describe bogus as "" harvey , but you can see the rabbit . . . and bogus could have been -- and should have been -- a simple story of mutual need , and there are plenty of reasons to believe it could have been a rather good one . instead , poster-driven film-making has turned out yet another promising but disappointing effort . there are a lot of things right with bogus , beginning with the performances . whoopi goldberg apparently decided to shake off a string of one-note trash-talkers and turn in some of her best work in years ; harriet is not the typical whoopi wiseacre , although she still gets in a few decent lines . shaggy-haired haley joel osment hovers just this side of precocity , doing surprisingly little posing and emoting as the smart but lonely albert , and he really seems to work well with other actors . the connection between goldberg and osment develops slowly , but eventually it seems quite genuine . that role , unfortunately , is the real problem with bogus , because someone should have realized that its central conceit was a big mistake . it is evident enough in the fact that depardieu really has nothing to do but strike an offended pose when someone doesn't believe in him or feed albert lines like a french teleprompter . bogus is a prop , not a character -- he is required strictly to smile benignly and to offer advice which one would expect from a child psychologist rather than an imaginary playmate . the more substantial issue from a structural standpoint is that screenwriter alvin sargent never commits to whom this story is about , and bogus is the crutch which allows him to do it . when albert and bogus are conversing , bogus is about a boy in need of comfort , and that is _not_ what it should be about . they also end up condescending both to harriet and to the audience , because we should no more be able to see bogus than we are able to see harvey . harriet's doubts are given no weight , and there is a strange lack of trust in the audience demonstrated by the refusal to allow our imaginations -- which the story seems to value so greatly -- do their work . i am certain that some viewers will find the more fanciful elements in bogus enchanting . these same viewers might also consider my pooh-poohing of those elements so much humbuggery , but to do so is to misunderstand my meaning . bogus should be fanciful ; it simply didn't need to be obvious . imagine more time spent establishing harriet's workaholic character , and less time spent on goofy scenes like albert's defense of bogus in his classroom . bogus is far from a bad film -- goldberg is too good , and there are some solid laughs -- but there is a far more affecting film to be found somewhere where a tale of redemption and imagination takes precedence over how easy it will be to construct an advertising campaign .

1571,"you will not find many family films which radiate the fundamental warmth and decency that fly away home does , and somehow that makes it more disappointing that it is not a better film . it is a story with an agreeably casual demeanor , positive messages to spare , and virtually nothing which could give offense ( except for a pair of gratuitous profanities included in a calculated effort to avoid a "" g "" rating ) . yet fly away home rarely manages to make the leap from agreeable to genuinely involving . in an era where most films seem to be striving to deafen you , fly away home is a film so soft-spoken it may cause a run on the theater's assisted listening devices . i don't think that anyone will argue that the first half of fly away home is not simply lovely . the sparkling cinematography , by the gifted caleb deschanel , and mark isham's multi-faceted score contribute to the charming scenes of amy bonding with her flock , and clever low-angle shots make them more comical . as sweet and unassuming as those scenes are , it soon becomes clear that there isn't much going on beneath the surface of fly away home . on the one hand , it is refreshing that we are not beaten over the head with the metaphorical significance of amy's attachment to her avian orphans , or with weepy professions of father-daughter love after the obligatory period of estrangement . on the other hand , robert rodat and vince mckewen don't give their characters enough substance , and the nominal family drama of fly away home is muted by the absence of enough early scenes showing us amy's difficulty adjusting to her new circumstances . jeff daniels , dana delany ( as tom's girlfriend ) and terry kinney ( as tom's brother ) all do perfectly nice work , but the characters lack spark , and the story lacks the drama to accommodate their one-dimensional benevolence . it is almost as though anna paquin , still possessing the spooky detachment of the piano even with the nose ring she sports in the film's second half , infects the entire production with her preternatural serenity . there are some fanciful moments during that flight , including amy's late-night surprise at a military airfield , but other episodes serve little purpose , and the film drags a bit as it approaches its conclusion . none of this is likely to matter tremendously to young viewers , who will enjoy the adorable geese , and their parents , who will welcome the fundamental warmth and decency which they haven't seen nearly enough of . i just couldn't help wishing that fly away home , although it was based on a true story , had been pitched a bit less like a matter-of-fact documentary and allowed the conflict between amy and tom to matter a bit more . perhaps a few more voices could have been raised .

1572,"screenplay : robert harling . director : hugh wilson . running time : 102 minutes mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) reviewed by scott renshaw . there is something so unapologetically out-of-date about the first wives club that it becomes somewhat endearing almost in spite of itself . if you remember the 1980 jane fonda-lily tomlin-dolly parton comedy 9 to 5 , you will be familiar with the basic theme of the first wives club , as well as the era from which it seems to arise . the idea of mis-treated housewives wreaking terrible vengeance on the pig-men who done 'em wrong is likely to cause much hand-wringing in the sensitive 1990s , and i might buy into that if the first wives club seemed at all interested in the real problems of real people . what it really turns out to be is a silly sit-com of a movie with lots of bark but very little bite . for a while , it is entertaining enough to watch the stars of the first wives club sink their teeth into the kind of juicy roles which are not generally available to women their age . that context makes hawn's part the most fun -- elise is an aging film actress using every surgical means at her disposal to fight off the ravages of time and avoid playing "" the mother . "" the first wives club is not a particularly creative revenge fantasy in the first place -- the justice isn't poetic because the women go for their exes' wallets , not their middle-aged egos and libidos -- but wilson's haphazard shot selection makes it a rather clumsy one besides . everyone pauses to make sure we understand that whatever fun we might have been having was all in the service of a very important message . it is even more disappointing that one of our heroines actually reconciles with the husband we just spend an hour and a half cheering against , but i suppose that is actually in keeping with the retro feel of the first wives club . there are several small pleasures in the first wives club -- like showgirls ingenue elizabeth berkeley in the karmically glorious role of a talentless young actress -- and one large disappointment . as a pilot for a network sit-com , it is fairly enjoyable ; as a big-screen comedy , it is a pilot for a network sit-com .

1573,"i know that americans love an underdog , but really . . . enough already . it is tempting to sell the compelling story behind the movie ( particularly if you arc concerned about whether there is a compelling story _in_ the movie ) , but i believe that there are negative consequences to turning every independent film-maker to come down the pike into horatio alger . these young directors are experiencing success , but it is success with an asterisk , because the audiences have been asked to appreciate their work not on its merit but because they worked so darned hard . ed's next move is a perfectly pleasant little romantic comedy , an unassuming and unpretentious character study which makes more than a casual not to annie hall . walsh has fashioned an outsider's-eye-view valentine to new york's idiosyncracies the way allen fashions insider's-eye-view valentines , and both films find neurosis getting in the way of a potential romance ; walsh even cribs from annie hall's more surreal moments , like a scene with translators interpreting the conversation in which anne breaks up with eddie which recalls annie hall's sub-titles scene . still , there is an appealing performance by matt ross as a smart , likeable protagonist who , blessedly , is not a self-absorbed aspiring artist of some sort like so many indie film protagonists , and solid supporting work from kevin carroll as a ladies' man who is not a stereotypical jerk . although walsh provides few laugh-out-loud moments , he also doesn't seem wrapped up in showing off his own cleverness , and the result is a comedy which makes you feel comfortable . and that is about all it does . there is a place for entertainments like ed's next move , and you could spend your seven dollars at the movies in far worse ways , but it would not surprise me to see a rush to anoint walsh as the next edward ( the brothers mcmullen ) burns or kevin ( clerks ) smith . there is a disturbing tendency among critics ( and yes , i include myself among them ) to treat an independent film like a high school play , where it is considered a great show if everyone remembers their lines and no one trips over the set . the thing is that those high school actors and directors turn into college actors and directors , and mere competence suddenly isn't quite as cute . getting a film made -- independent or otherwise -- is a brutal business , but a film is no more or less worthy of praise because it was a labor of love . ed's next move has several things going for it , notably young characters who have some ambition and common sense , but walsh shows no particular facility with a camera , and his story has virtually nothing going on beneath its agreeable surface . basically , it is an amusing bit of fluff which is quite similar to other bits of fluff you have seen before , one which promises and delivers little more than a few inoffensive smiles .

1577,"screenplay : robert b . weide , based on the novel by kurt vonnegut . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , profanity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 113 minutes . having read most of kurt vonnegut's novels before viewing mother night , i predicted to myself that it was the most likely of vonnegut's works to make a successful transition to the screen . much of the vonnegut canon has struck me as singularly unfilmable -- including one which _was_ filmed , slaughterhouse-five -- but mother night's narrative was a relatively straightforward one , and its themes equally direct . in a sense , director keith gordon's mother night has proved me correct ; in another sense , it has proved me dreadfully wrong . thought well-crafted and moderately compelling in its own right , mother night loses a lot with the absence of vonnegut's ironic voice . where the novel was a sly social comedy , the film strives almost for greek tragedy . it is a finely constructed narrative which holds the focus on one of vonnegut's key lines : "" we are what we pretend to be , so we must be careful what we pretend to be . "" there is a difference , however , between retaining lines and retaining the tone of those lines , and that is where robert b . weide's script becomes a disappointment . though mother night deals with heavy subject matter -- conscience , personal identity , the holocaust -- vonnegut never resorted to heaviness to tell the story . the kind of detached irony which is vonnegut's stock in trade is tough to convey cinematically , and gordon steers instead into the twin extremes of overly straight drama ( as in the scene where campbell watches an old newsreel of himself with growing horror ) or broad comedy ( the portrayal of a collection of hate-mongers who idolize campbell ) . too often , however , the earnestness becomes burdensome . it is an example of gordon and weide's traditional filmic story-telling that they try to turn certain twists of identity or plot developments into grand surprises , when vonnegut reveals them casually through campbell's narration long before the events occur chronologically . mother night may be one of his most traditionally plotted novels , but it still isn't about the plot . . . it's about a perspective and an idea . gordon has not made a bad film ; it is well-acted and keeps you interested from moment to moment . he simply wants campbell's moment of truth to come like a thunderbolt , rather than the way vonnegut prefers to deliver it : as a single finger tapping you ever so lightly on the shoulder .

1580,"it has been a long time since a film inspired as profound a case of "" what am i missing ? "" in me as shine . this australian drama has been a fixture on year-end top ten lists , won a best picture nod from the national board of review , and picked up a new york film critics association best actor for star geoffrey rush . so i sat myself down to watch shine , and i waited to be transported . and i waited . and i waited . and it never happened . shine is an extremely well-crafted film , but it doesn't pay off at a gut level . director scott hicks' restrained approach to an uplifting story ends up choking much of the life out of it . perhaps the film's best sequence involves david's performance of the "" rach 3 "" at the albert hall , wild hair and sweat flying in slow motion as his ultimate artistic triumph becomes a mute pounding of keys . even the death of one character cannot evoke much emotional response , and david's match with gillian is apparently the result of complementary astrological charts instead of a genuine connection between them . shine may be about david helfgott , but peter helfgott is the real soul of the film , and when he disappears from the narrative there is nothing to drive it forward . geoffrey rush's performance as the adult david is superb , a portrait of mental illness which is vivid and lacking the obtrusive kookiness of many screen depictions of such conditions ; his mile-a-minute monologues full of puns and streams of consciousness display a brilliant mind imploding upon itself . there simply isn't much to the second half of shine which leads us to a conclusion . hicks' background is in documentary film-making , and it seems that his instinct is to let david's story tell itself . most films about characters struggling to triumph over adversity play to the broadest possible emotional canvas , and it is admirable that hicks has chosen not to bludgeon his audience insensible with feel-good signifiers . shine is a good-looking , good-sounding and thoroughly professional production with a pair of excellent performances by armin mueller-stahl and geoffrey rush . it is also too sedate by half , a story of shattered genius which opts for a dim glow when it needs a dazzling shine .

"" buenos aires "" gets a swirl of percussion to match eva's drive , and "" i'd be surprisingly good for you "" has a seductive swing . certain songs do have a dated , jangly 70s guitar sound , but the characteristic infectious bombast of webber's compositions holds up surprisingly well . what works far less well is the presentation of the film's three central -- and , for all practical purposes , only -- characters . antonio banderas brings his appealing swagger to che , as well as a voice which compensates for a weak lower range with some sweet high notes . che is the voice of eva's critics , yet he isn't a complete character , and neither is juan peron . that leaves madonna to carry the dramatic weight of evita , and it is plenty clear that she is eager to prove she can handle it . madonna understands determination , and she can convey it ; charisma is another story . you can't act a magnetic personality , and madonna is left to play benevolence without the force of will which makes her uncertain motives intriguing . the irony is that , for someone who has made a career of not caring about how people perceive her , madonna seems to want too much to be liked and respected as an actress . her evita lacks mystery , making alan parker's film a sweeping piece of visual theater with a star who wants to step into the audience and thank everyone for coming .

1584,"mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 104 minutes . albert brooks is a rather odd case as a film-maker . on the one hand , he goes years between projects , has loyal and generally intelligent fans and never has had a really big commercial success . brooks is like a hybrid of woody allen and ivan reitman , a writer/director too smart and eccentric to get maximum mileage out of his marketing-friendly plots . mother is a perfect example of brooks' nose for high-concept , but for once he doesn't work any particular magic with it . riding on the familiarity of his situations and a wicked performance by debbie reynolds , brooks turns out an amusing but uneven domestic comedy . john determines that all of his failed relationships have had certain elements in common , and that those elements might be traceable to his upbringing . much of the appeal of mother -- most of the appeal , to be frank -- comes from the character of beatrice henderson , less as created by brooks than as realized by reynolds . there are moments when brooks verges on condescension towards his older female characters -- an encounter with neighbors in a grocery store is both funny and rather embarrassing -- but debbie reynolds salvages every one by giving her line readings an intelligent twist . even when beatrice is fumbling with technology or circling a parking lot past the one available space , she never comes off as dim or pathetic . with a professionalism showing no signs of rust after a long layoff from screen acting , reynolds wrestles a laundry list of motherly quirks into a wonderful character . this achievement comes almost in spite of brooks' script , which has plenty of funny lines but too little narrative direction . the goodwill generated by the main premise carries mother a surprisingly long way , but brooks doesn't do all that much with it . the film is full of situations with great comic potential , most of which inspire a chuckle and little more because brooks prefers wry observation to outrageousness . it is a scene which primes you for a huge laugh -- a man , his mother , lingerie . . . can you feel the giddy tension rising ? -- then dissolves after yet another good-natured chuckle . mother is full of moments , like a scene where john channel-surfs through a succession of info-mercials , where brooks seems to be waiting for a punch line to formulate itself instead of attacking the set-up to provide a payoff . mother is almost always an entertaining film , but it is not nearly as subversive as it could have been , or as flirting with disaster was covering similar ground of warped familial relations . perhaps the problem is that the script does not launch itself from full , rich characterizations . in fact , as the story unfolds , it seems that brooks has constructed his story around psychological case studies rather than people . every time mother does something exasperating , john deconstructs it in search of its deeper significance . the result is frustrating , as though brooks were telling jokes then stopping after each one to explain why it was just as sad as it was funny . it is one of the characteristics which makes brooks unique as a film-maker that he builds his climax around a moment of insight rather than a wacky car chase , but there has to be a middle ground . debbie reynolds takes mother's high-concept and gives it high energy , making it a film anyone who has had a mother could like , but perhaps only a mother could love .

"" a linear narrative is not a pre-requisite for the evocation of an emotional response , and david lynch is one of the few artists who has tried to push the limits of cinema as a medium of sound , images and possibilities . lost highway is lynch at his best and his worst , as unnerving as it is excessive . any attempt to describe the plot of lost highway is ultimately an exercise in futility , but essentially it involves two uniquely connected story-lines . there is little doubt in my mind that , when he is working at the top of his form , david lynch can turn our darkest unspoken fears into brilliant cinema like no other living director . there are nightmare visions in lynch projects which can leave you shaking for days , and there are moments during the first hour of lost highway which build and release tension with an almost unbearable skill . long stretches of silence are punctuated by sudden bursts of sound ; characters drift into darkness in shots that linger long enough to make you start peeking through your fingers . with its eerie production design and slowly mounting paranoia , lost highway begins to cast a spell which will have viewers anxious but intrigued . too bad it takes such a short time to lose those viewers entirely . the fred-to-pete transformation is not a fatal error in and of itself , though audiences used to conventional narratives may be baffled by it . the real villain in the collapse of lost highway is lynch's inability to ground the film so that its world makes internal sense . eraserhead's landscape was unquestionably surreal ; blue velvet , as unsettling as it was , always focused on the horrors of the real world . the mistake in lost highway isn't the outrageous character shift , but the way the other characters in the film respond to that event as a problem to be solved . if lost highway is about psychosis made flesh , about psychological duality becoming physical duality , it falls short of pulling you into that world because it has given you the impression that there is an "" answer . "" and while you're busy giving yourself a headache trying to solve that mystery , you aren't getting caught up in the atmosphere of the mystery itself . lost highway contains too many individual moments of vintage lynch to be considered a failure . the grimly comic violence , the degraded sexuality and the languid exchanges of dialogue are all familiar , and seem more like self-plagiarism than a characteristic style . lynch often seems more interested in re-creating than creating , in taking the perfect 10's of his career and cranking them up to 11 . for its first hour , lost highway is brilliant , and there are flashes of that brilliance for another 75 minutes , but they don't hold together because there isn't a consistent tone or structure to sustain them . in a film where everything seems to be in two places at once , it is fitting that lost highway doesn't stay in any one place long enough .

1588,"screenplay : theodore witcher . director : theodore witcher . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , brief nudity ) running time : 105 minutes . theodore witcher's love jones won the audience award at the 1997 sundance film festival , which lately seems to be more of a general message on the state of cinema than a comment on a specific film . last year's winner , the spitfire grill , was a maudlin contraption which was laudable for being a thoroughly decent redemption story . in the case of love jones , the audience award may have been sending a similar message about what they'd like to see more of . african-americans in the movies have been either clowns , criminals or police captains so often in recent years that love jones -- a low-key comedy-drama about educated black artists -- was bound to strike a responsive chord . i can't help but wonder whether the sundance audience was rewarding love jones itself or the idea of a film _like_ love jones . make no mistake , witcher's sophisticated romantic tale is exceptionally well-crafted and includes some appealing moments , but the script is sometimes lazy and not particularly interesting . it's a film with better intentions than results . it is fairly incidental to the story that these characters happen to be african-americans , yet that doesn't mean that the film is color-blind , or that the characters talk like they just walked out of eton . the scenes between darius and his friends -- savon ( isaiah washington ) , hollywood ( bill bellamy ) and sheila ( bernadette l . clark ) -- have a low-key energy , sparked by the wit of their ritualized insults . the dialogue feels natural and authentic , and the performances are characterized by a convincing sense of familiarity which makes them even stronger collectively than individually . if love jones had been a film about these characters just sitting around talking , i probably would have enjoyed it much more . the problem is that the plot _is_ essentially a re-hash of when harry met sally , with relationships not nearly as compelling or funny . darryl jones contributes a wonderfully jazzy score , but that score infuses love jones with a languid pace , the effect of which is to make you as nonchalant about the fate of darius and nina's romance as they seem to be themselves . there is plenty of chemistry between larenz tate and nia long ; there's just not enough drama . their relationship seems just fine "" just kickin' it . "" that casual quality sometimes seeps into witcher's plotting . threads of sub-plots drift through love jones at regular intervals , and witcher never seems interested in explaining them in any detail . the large supporting cast consists of faces and voices which don't develop into full-fledged people . they are more like background notes in a tone poem . love jones is the kind of film i would like to encourage , but i find it hard to recommend it enthusiastically . it's respectable , it's admirable , it's smooth and smart and professional . it's just not particularly enjoyable . audiences have been jonesing for characters like those in love jones , but they may be able to work up no more than a like jones for this film .

1589,"i suppose one could find some sociological significance to the glut of recent films about inattentive parents and neglected children , if one were inclined to give a cliche a more grandiose label . from whoopi goldberg in bogus to arnold schwarzenegger in jingle all the way , from tim allen in the santa clause to tim allen in jungle2jungle , the reformed workaholic has become the most popular protagonist in formula comedies , going through a series of wacky adventures before giving a big hug to a sad-eyed son or daughter . jim carrey is the latest star to step into this vehicle , and he certainly has enough pure manic energy to give is some spark , but he has to work awfully hard to do it . liar liar is a pure show-off showcase for carrey , and by sheer force of will he makes it funny , despite a ridiculously limp script which has only one place to go . i have this theory that the script for liar liar , credited to paul guay and stephen mazur , consisted largely of parenthetical gaps which read something like "" jim does some weird physical stuff here "" or "" jim makes a goofy face . "" there is a staggering lack of creativity in liar liar given the possibilities of the premise . carrey is trapped in one situation -- the courtroom -- for far too long , and that situation begins to look like an extended homage to steve martin's work in all of me , but without martin's ability to maintain his dignity . the dialogue consists largely of one fairly obvious put-downs after another , most of which are salvaged by carrey's priceless reaction takes and his futile attempts to control his honesty . it seems fairly evident that without carrey , liar liar would have been an utter catastrophe . with him , it manages some genuine comic high notes . carrey seems to realize that the entire film is riding on his shoulders , and he plays it that way , as though the other people in the film were scenery to be swallowed or knocked out of the way . for all practical purposes they are , particularly in the aforementioned partners' meeting , where a dozen people sit around a table for the express purpose of being skewered ; carrey often seems to be performing for the rest of the cast as well as for the audience . only cary elwes , in a subtle turn as audrey's painfully earnest boyfriend , lends any support at all . as long as carrey remains in overdrive , liar liar provides fairly consistent moderate laughs -- as well as a few big ones -- but the entire enterprise feels compromised by the tired paternal redemption motif . it almost spoils the fun of watching carrey do his best impression of a human pinball , knowing that eventually he's going to have to break down in a tearful proclamation of devotion to his son . it's too bad that , with carrey on board and a fanciful concept at the ready , liar liar can't work up an inspired story to match carrey's inspired performance . in fact , it can barely work up enough material to fill 90 minutes , resorting to end-credit out-takes to pad the running time . she may be right , but thank heaven someone involved in liar liar was working as hard as all these single-minded screen parents we've been seeing lately .

1590,"screenplay : christopher reed and cynthia carle . director : randall miller . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , mild sexual content ) running time : 105 minutes . i wasn't sure i would be able to enjoy the 6th man as a wacky comedy , given the uncomfortable familiarity of the plot . gathers' death affected me as profoundly as any celebrity tragedy ever has , and i cringed at the idea of that event being turned into a source of supernatural hijinks . perhaps that's why i was so pleasantly surprised to discover how much heart the 6th man turned out to have . though slapstick is definitely part of the mix , there is a genuinely affecting human story at the core of this film which outweighs its occasional clumsiness . the 6th man is a fantasy of course , but close followers of pac-10 basketball will appreciate that it's not just the presence of ghostly activity which makes the film fantastic . not only are washington and stanford in this film's final four , but dismissed head coaches todd bozeman of california and jim harrick of ucla are still sitting on their respective teams' benches in game footage ; if that doesn't qualify as fantasy , i'm not sure what does . the 6th man is certainly targeted at college basketball fans given its release during final four weekend , but the on-court action is often awkwardly photographed with too many close-ups and choppy editing . for a film about college basketball , the 6th man generally doesn't try very hard to re-create the fan excitement or game situations of the sport . it's a comedy , and occasionally it's a very funny one . marlon wayans turns in an extremely entertaining and energetic physical performance as kenny , who has to do a lot of solo acting as though he is being hassled by his invisible older brother -- hugs , head-locks , wrestling matches and other practical jokes . it's fun , if somewhat predictable stuff , mostly because wayans is able to sell it with enthusiasm . fortunately , the 6th man is actually more enjoyable when it's not a comedy . some of the character material is unnecessary -- notably the attempt at a romantic relationship between kenny and r . c . ( yes , michael michele is a woman ) -- but the sibling story-line is extremely effective . the interaction between the two brothers , squabbles and all , is what makes the 6th man more than the formulaic disney silliness you might expect . in spite of some erratic pacing and uneven comedy , the 6th man has the emotional content to give a tragedy the weight it deserves , as well as the entertainment it needs .

1591,"screenplay : greg mottola . producers : nancy tenenbaum and steven soderbergh . director : greg mottola . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 88 minutes . there is a quality to certain independent films which i have referred to in the past as an "" oppressive quirkiness . "" as frustrating as it can be to watch a hollywood release which is a non-stop monotone of plot or action , it is similarly frustrating when a film-maker's infatuation with colorful characters at the expense of narrative results in all those colors blurring into a dull brown . actors understandably love playing those characters , but independent writer-directors -- frequently rookie auteurs -- can't always tame their creations into a solid story . greg mottola's the daytrippers is characterized by a quirkiness more pervasive than oppressive , and some of it is quite entertaining . by the time it's all over , however , you may find yourself wondering what the point of it all was . for well over half of the daytrippers , the character riffs provide a lot of laughs without becoming repetitive or abrasive . liev schreiber has the most subtly amusing role , an intellectual would-be author who bashes middle class obliviousness even as he sucks up to the obliviously middle class rita . anne meara and pat mcnamara play the bickering parents with interesting shadings on stereotypical characterizations , and parker posey again shows off her indie-queen charm . mottola puts them in a variety of bizarre situations , including what posey aptly describes as "" the shortest car chase in history , "" and peppers the film with memorable minor roles like marcia gay harden's turn as a drunken party-goer trying to deal with the presence of an ex-boyfriend at the party . as the story plays out , eliza's positioning in that sane center proves to be one of the daytrippers' most glaring problems . it may be part of mottola's vision for eliza that she is too passive , yet the result is that we don't understand enough about who eliza is or how she feels about her life . we see that rita has manipulated her daughters' relationships in a thinly disguised disdain for their value as individuals , and that should guide us to an awakening in eliza . instead , we get an abrupt emotional response and an even more abrupt conclusion to the film , hard on the heels of a revelation which feels more self-consciously clever than appropriate for the rest of the film . on an even more fundamental level , the daytrippers loses its audience because it loses its sense of humor . after sixty minutes worth of appealing wit , mottola perhaps falls victim to a concern that his film will be considered too frivolous . the daytrippers has a lot of good-natured humor to recommend it , but i'm not sure greg mottola really knew what he wanted to do with the lively characters he had created . he may have learned one lesson of independent film-making the hard way : it's a good start to put a bunch of interesting characters together in a vehicle and set them on their way , but sooner or later that vehicle has to come to a destination . the daytrippers is an entertaining ride while that vehicle is in motion .

1592,"bette midler is not the star of that old feeling , and neither is dennis farina . actually , that's not entirely true . that old feeling isn't really about midler and farina , however , which is why is needs some kind of warning for unsuspecting audiences . call it the a time to kill memorial disclaimer : "" the big star getting lead billing is actually playing a supporting role , and the previews are remarkably deceptive . "" instead of getting a brassy broad starring in a brassy broad farce , viewers will find a surprisingly mellow comedy starring someone named paula marshall . it is only because marshall is so charming that that old feeling doesn't fall flat on its mellowness . dan and lilly's divorce was anything but amicable , and the expected shouting match causes quite a spectacle at the reception . the first half-hour certainly fosters the expectation that that old feeling is going to be a tart-tongued parade of family quarrels , exaggerated characters and physical comedy . the opening scene trots out the familiar "" woman swallows her surprise engagement ring in a desert "" scenario ( seen most recently in woody allen's everyone says i love you ) , but it is still goofy fun . the wedding gives the sniping dan and lilly some clever insults , and also introduces the one-dimensional characters of their second spouses . david rasche is particularly funny as the incessantly jargon-spewing touchy-feely therapist , who talks himself hoarse and makes terribly sincere pronouncements about how important it is "" to dialogue and to language . "" director carl reiner keeps all these elements under control , never allowing scenes to degenerate into pie fights or prat-falls , while still keeping that old feeling lively and sharp-witted . that sharp wit is dulled , however , once dan and lilly run off together , drastically reducing the level of comedic tension and shifting the focus to molly's quest for her parents and for her own romantic happiness . that old feeling needs to lay more foundation for their incompatibility -- more early scenes of molly's playful streak , more sense of keith's stuffy careerism and hypocrisy -- so that we understand the story is really going to be about molly . as it stands , that old feeling often seems disjointed . there is too little conflict for too much of that old feeling as we wait for molly to make her choice between keith and joey . thank heavens paula marshall is such a find . she is the kind of actress who seems to be comfortable in any kind of scene , combining an intelligent sexiness with a willingness to look completely silly ; the single funniest moment in that old feeling may be a depressed molly drowning her sorrows in a mouthful of spray whipping cream . there are some very nice scenes between marshall and danny nucci , whose photographer begins as a supreme annoyance but gradually develops an adorably scruffy puppy-dog quality , and molly's romantic dilemma becomes interesting only because marshall makes her such a flustered sweetheart . if you find yourself entertained by that old feeling , it may not be in the way you expect , or by whom you expect .

( about ) you only wish you could see her try to say that with a straight face , to see what _really_ good acting is . there are plenty of words one could use to describe anaconda , but "" subtle "" ain't one of them . b-movies don't get much b-movie-er than this one , which doesn't mean it's a bad film . on its own level -- thanks to some hilariously ghoulish special effects -- it's actually something of a guilty pleasure . i offer a warning here that some of the following information might be considered spoilers , assuming you have been hermetically sealed away from pop culture and have never seen a suspense film . anaconda doesn't work very hard to buck the conventions of the genre ; in fact , it seems to revel in them . as one might expect , characters die . as one might also expect , they generally die in inverse order of their placement in the credits . anaconda even steals a page from 1980s slasher films by giving a monster a taste for those with questionable moral fiber . shoot a monkey ? the script serves up stock characters like the pompous prima donna westridge and the villainous poacher sarone with a giddy disregard for anything but plot , plot and more plot . not that the plot makes much sense ( beginning with why the narrator is along on the shoot in the first place ) , or even moves very briskly for a suspense thriller . director luis llosa ( the specialist ) often can't seem to decide whether anaconda is about the conflict with the snake or the conflict with sarone , and it proves to be a mistake to focus on the shipboard clashes when it means the characters are going to have to talk for any length of time . voight , whose perpetual sneer and absurd paraguayan accent make pacino's performance in scarface look positively subdued , goes madly over the top and looks like he's the only person having any fun . at least eric stoltz had the good sense to grab his check and spend half the film in a coma . so why , then , is anaconda more fun than glorified b-movies like twister or independence day ? because it never pretends to be anything more , and because it includes the kind of scenes a good monster movie needs : moments which leave you laughing even as you are going "" eeewwwww . "" sometimes a film only needs one really memorable scene to leave you feeling a goofy sense of satisfaction . anaconda boasts at least three , including a shot from inside the snake's digestive system ( the ana-colon-cam ? ) and it doesn't even matter that the computer-generated snake is nobody's idea of state-of-the-art visual effects work . a b-movie shouldn't be out to impress you . anaconda is simplistic , and could have used more of its monster , but it delivers . i'll look for my "" subtle messages "" in movies that aren't about 40-foot-long killer snakes .

1598,"writer/director mark herman is so concerned about sounding the trumpet to deliver a "" message "" in brassed off that he almost ruins a perfectly good character study . brassed off is at its best painting a vivid portrait of life in a northern coal town . for the players , it is a social club which provides a rare opportunity to blow off steam , demonstrated in an amusing montage of ever-more-inebriated performances . if herman had kept his focus on this clash between pragmatism and idealism , best exemplified by the relationship between danny and phil ( an exceptional performance by stephen thompkinson ) , brassed off could have been a minor gem . unfortunately , herman is determined to make sure we leave the theater enlightened about the injustice of the pit closure program . like too many directors of films about social issues , herman doesn't trust our sympathy for the characters to create all the resonance the story needs . add an over-dramatized but under-developed romance between fitzgerald and ewan mcgregor ( as a young miner ) and you have a film which strays from its strengths . the human drama of brassed off makes for much sweeter music than strident sermonizing .

"" in my best friend's wedding , roberts concedes to being a movie star once again . that premise sets the stage for some potentially outrageous comedy of the "" all's fair in love and war "" variety , but roberts never looks entirely comfortable with being outrageous . the interpretation of movie star-dom adopted by roberts , screenwriter ronald bass and director p . j . hogan ( muriel's wedding ) involves never being anything less than likeable , never doing anything which risks turning the audience against you . they don't understand that one of the perqs of being a movie star is that the audience is always ready to be on your side . it's no great revelation that there are only two possible outcomes in my best friend's wedding -- either julianne will triumph over an out-classed opponent , or she'll learn in important lesson and make a sacrifice . in either case , we're ready to be amused by her machinations before we get to that outcome ; we greet julianne's announcement that kimmy is "" toast "" with a chuckle of anticipation , not a sigh of disapproval . the reason my best friend's wedding isn't a better comedy , the reason it meanders but rarely soars , is that julianne's feeble efforts are about as likely to toast kimmy as a hot water bottle is to toast bread . bass's script is guided by the idea that julianne's hands should never get too dirty . roberts has some wonderful reaction shots in my best friend's wedding , but she reacts far more than she acts . in one of the film's most ironic lines , julianne apologizes to michael for all the "" awful and not even terribly imaginative things "" she has done . bass might have been better served coming up with more imaginative things rather than apologizing for the ones he came up with . surprisingly , my best friend's wedding is still fairly entertaining , thanks to a few unexpected bursts of irreverence . director hogan , who is turning into a prime candidate to direct a musical some day , continues his fascination with lip-synching to pop chestnuts , setting a slick opening credits sequence to "" wishin' and hopin' "" and turning a rehearsal dinner into an impromptu sing-along to "" i say a little prayer . "" the latter scene is a showcase for rupert everett , whose hilarious supporting work as george eliminates all fears of yet another "" gay friend "" character . his every moment on screen gives the film a jolt of comic energy , and proves that it is possible to be both devilish and thoroughly appealing . julia roberts could have learned a few things by studying his performance . if this is what she feared about movie star roles -- that they would require her merely to show up , smile and toss her hair -- she may have had good reason to be concerned . while my best friend's wedding is pretty amusing , roberts' return to being a pretty woman is pretty ordinary .

1601,"screenplay : ed solomon , based on the comic book by lowell cunningham . producers : walter f . parkes and laurie macdonald . director : barry sonnenfeld . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , violence ) running time : 98 minutes . if batman & robin arrived as the summer film everyone was ready to hate , men in black arrived as the film everyone was ready to love . this was to be the antidote to a season filled with moribund sequels and lackluster high concepts , a cinematic life preserver for movie-goers drowning in over-promoted and under-developed bilge water blockbusters . it would bring together an appealing rising star , a savvy veteran character actor , an idiosyncratic director , a clever concept and fun visual effects . this , at last , would be something worth standing in line for . men in black the movie -- as opposed to men in black the much-anticipated event -- isn't worth standing in line for . it's a frisky , fairly enjoyable summer fantasy , one which avoids the common big-budget trap of over-staying its welcome . at the same time , it's a bit disappointing , and for an unexpected reason . men in black has been edited to the point where scenes collide awkwardly , where attempts at sub-plots cry out for more development . it's a film which actually _under_-stays its welcome . that says a lot for what is on the screen for just over 90 minutes . their responsibility is overseeing the earth's alien population -- alien , as in the extra-terrestrial kind -- as well as keeping the existence of those aliens secret from the general population . when director barry sonnenfeld plays that premise for its most outrageous and witty comic possibilities , men in black is a whole lot of fun . jones and smith have a solid rapport in a variation on the standard buddy-cop pairing , turning in performances which are knowing without winking too obviously at the audience . their supporting cast is sharp as well , particularly vincent d'onofrio in a hilarious turn as the sadistic alien bug who inhabits the skin of a redneck farmer ; d'onofrio's physical movements are even more hideously other-worldly than rick baker's make-up effects . the grandest , goofiest moments involve mib headquarters , rendered by bo welch's production design and eric brevig's visual effects as a cross between kennedy airport , ellis island and mos eisley spaceport . that wry charm , along with the collected talent in men in black , should have been enough to justify the hype . and so they might have been , if sonnenfeld had put together a film with a momentum to match its moments . the plot races from place to place so quickly that you're never given a chance to piece it together . as a collection of amusing individual scenes , men in black is just fine . it just never makes sense when precious minutes are devoted to half-hearted attempts at character development . it's not fair to call men in black unsatisfying , because there's a lot of great stuff in it . it does , however , feel unfinished ; it's great stuff not yet formed into a great movie . more to the point , it functions best as a set-up for -- oh bitter irony -- yet another big-budget summer sequel . only when compared to its current competition is it the summer masterpiece everyone was ready for it to be . calling a critic 'elitist' is like calling an accountant 'mathist .

"" you might swear that johnson had made steel 20 years ago , dusted it off and gussied it up with a few modern special effects , if not for the fact that shaquille o'neal would have been in pre-school at the time . the funny thing about steel is that it's so unfashionable it's actually refreshing . he simply acts out of a sense of responsibility . . . and perhaps it helps to have a certain nostalgia for the admittedly b-grade tv steel is modeled after , because it's certainly nobody's idea of stellar film-making . johnson asks little of his actors -- he's used to working with lou ferrigno , for heaven's sake -- offering them direction which seems to consist of "" stand there and read your lines . "" he seems perfectly aware that steel is a formulaic action film with stock characters and fight scenes placed at carefully spaced intervals , yet he also seems perfectly sincere about his subject . that sincerity is part of what makes steel so improbably satisfying . johnson refuses to wink at steel's selflessness , or to mock him for being such a square ; he refuses to take his straightforward narrative and turn it into a collection of incoherently edited battles peppered with one-liners . steel isn't going to dazzle anybody , particularly the kids who will make up most of the audience . they'll be used to cutting edge effects , chaotic battles and even more chaotic storylines , not the perfectly comprehensible ( if extremely simplistic ) narrative of steel . those kids may find it all pretty old-fashioned , but i hope there's still a place for old-fashioned heroes , the kind who say "" yes , ma'am "" and mean it . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1605,"it's the moment which is supposed to tell the audience that the film-makers are hip to their own derivativeness , that it's pointless to expect more than recycled genre conventions . maybe the skyscraper is now a school , and maybe the vacationing cop is now a surly teen computer whiz , but the rest will be chapter and verse from the contemporary action film bible -- "" die hard in a prep school . "" right ? well , yes and no . though masterminds has plenty of die hard in its dna -- including a member of the hero's family among the hostages ( ozzie's stepsister melissa , played by katie stuart ) , a suave villain with an accent ( patrick stewart ) and a hidden agenda for the bad guys -- the reference in the script is actually a clever diversion to distract viewers from all the other antecedents . if you've been watching movies at all over the past twenty years , you've seen masterminds before . you just haven't seen it all in the same movie . of course the primary audience for masterminds _hasn't_ been watching movies for the past twenty years ; in fact , it hasn't been alive for the past twenty years . and it's a fairly satisfying diversion for that audience , as well as one their parents don't need to worry aobut . in a sense , it's the way that it's least like die hard which makes masterminds a solid entertainment for youngsters : you don't need to count dead bodies to keep track of the hero's progress . it's unlikely that adults will find much worthwhile in masterminds , unless it's patrick stewart's jolly performance as the leader of the terrorists . he shows a great sense for delivering what the film's audience demands , sneering and threatening just enough so that it's worth a big cheer when he allows himself to be humiliated . he also understands that the plot of masterminds -- which adults will be ahead of by a solid hour -- is about as inventive as your average episode of "" scooby-doo ; "" you can practically hear stewart begging to end the film with "" . . . and i would have gotten away with it if it hadn't been for that meddling kid .

1607,"mike leigh does not create film stories in a traditional way . his unique method of constructing scripts out of workshops with his actors has made it a safe bet that you won't find flat , flimsy characters running around in his films . you also won't find many traditional plot-driven narratives . at first , we wonder why she bothered . the initial interactions between the two are awkward , the talk exceedingly small . leigh understands the power of shared history to connect people , whether friends or family , even when personalities are polar opposites . so far , so very good , except that the dynamic i've just described comprises less than half of career girls' 87 minute running time . the majority of the film is devoted to flashbacks of the girls' college days , where another possible reason for their friendship becomes evident : they are both so irritating you can't imagine anyone else putting up with them . leigh has put together more than enough fantastic work ( high hopes , life is sweet , naked , secrets & lies ) to have earned the right to a minor stumble , but the stumble in career girls points out the potential danger in leigh's style . if you're going to give the audience a character-driven drama , you'd better not give them characters likely to drive them into the lobby . after making several wonderful films filled with believably complex people , leigh has made half of a wonderful film by making only half of two wonderful characters . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1609,"long-time readers of this space will recall that i have never promoted the myth of critical objectivity . i am merely a man , folks , a flesh-and-blood film fan with preferences and pet peeves just like everyone else . brilliant special effects will never move me like a brilliant script will . i'm indifferent about baseball , but i love baseball movies . "" heartwarming comedies "" leave me cold . i'm too easy on woody allen sometimes . and so on . the matchmaker appears to have been made with a direct network connection to my cinematic soft spots . now you're just not playing fair . their combined charm is irresistable , flimsy though the story may be . on a number of levels , it's clear that the matchmaker needs a bit more fleshing out . her relationship with sean ( nicely played by david o'hara as a fiery idealist ) is better developed than you find in most romantic comedies , but we never understand why it might be truly important to marcy . it's all very pleasant , in an inconsequential sort of way . then again , if you add up all the things about the matchmaker which are very pleasant , you have a fairly pleasant film experience . first there is garofolo herself , a screen presence unlike any other in film . acerbic , smart and unconventionally beautiful , garofolo improves a story by her mere presence . she doesn't have as strong a character to latch on to as she had in the truth about cats & dogs , but she's still an energetic presence who's easy to root for . o'hara is also quite pleasant , as is o'shea as the ethically shaky matchmaker . and of course there's the scenery and the local irish color , which is very pleasant indeed . the matchmaker has a heavy strain of fish-out-of-water comedy to it , but it rarely reeks of formula thanks to mark joffe's low-key direction and garofolo's ability to underplay a reaction take . still , as the film strolls along towards its conclusion with a few unnecessary intrusions by the political sub-plot , it might be seen as a bit uninspired and tedious , objectively speaking . i'm not objectively speaking , of course . one viewer might find little to like about the matchmaker . another -- who shall remain nameless -- might spend 95 minutes smiling at a friendly face in a friendly place . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

"" atkinson deserves better . there are a few brilliant bean moments in bean : the opening sequence which finds him shaving every exposed surface on his head ; a super-charged ride on an amusement park motion simulator ; bean pushing a draped painting through a hallway as though it were a gurney . the situations set up by richard curtis and robin driscoll aren't really the problem in bean . it's director mel smith who misses the point that "" mr . bean "" isn't about other people reacting to bean's absurd antics ; it's about bean responding to his own absurd antics . in one sense , i'm being a bit more harsh than bean deserves , because it's still more entertaining than most hollywood comedies . atkinson is too energetic a performer to allow bean to drift into unwatchability , making for a film which will provide audiences with plenty of satisfying laughs . but i can't help cringing at all the miscalculations that went into bean , most notably the sentimental message which becomes unnecessarily obtrusive . mr . bean growing as a character ? stuff and nonsense . i'd much rather that the makers of bean learned the lesson and produce a bean film deserving of the name , one which doesn't suffer from forced attempts at creating a feature length narrative . let his beloved teddy have more than a token cameo appearance . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1613,"twenty years ago , a film like mad city would have been a provocative and disturbing exploration of how television news can exploit a story to feed our blood-lust . in fact , it was . . . it paddy chayefsky's brilliant script and peter finch's mesmerizing final performance as unraveling anchorman howard beale made network a classic of dark satire , spotlighting the natural culmination of an obsessive pursuit of ratings . it was just outrageous enough to be entertaining , and just plausible enough to be alarming . the notion that televison news isn't just about the news . . . well , it just isn't news . it never manages to arouse much more than nods of recognition , because the images and situations are familiar to the point of cliche : alda's self-important anchorman , the selective editing of a story to fit a pre-determined agenda , the absurdity of a growing media feeding frenzy . as an ethics lesson , it's strident but ineffective , preaching to a nation of converts about a problem they all know exists but have no idea how to correct . it's fortunate , then , that mad city does a solid job of giving its subject a human face . that face doesn't belong to dustin hoffman , though brackett is the story's central character . playing simple challenges any actor , yet travolta plays simple with a disarming effectiveness . the relationship moments between baily and brackett are among the strongest in mad city , though it also provides a few chuckles as the public sympathies sway in the breeze . like most "" message "" films , however , it begins to wilt every time it underlines its message . mad city's primary stumbling block is its obviousness -- of the character developments , of the plot progression , of the scolding tone the film takes towards its targets . it reaches an audience which doesn't find sensationalism disturbing , but it delivers its story as though no one else had told it before . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

"" director clint eastwood chooses an ideal , languid pace for midnight which turns it into the perfect southern story : in no particular hurry to get anywhere , yet still intriguing in its richness of detail . in berendt's novel , that fragmented approach turns the city of savannah itself into the story's principal character . the williams trial functions primarily as a lightning rod for the attitudes and perceptions of the city's inhabitants , in whom eccentricity is ultimately a matter of degree . there are , however , some vacuums hollywood abhors , and midnight in the garden of good and evil tries to fill two of them with some pretty ineffective stuff . hancock works wonders with the novel's decade-long time frame , condensing events with impressive economy . he also strains to shove the story's square pegs into the gaping round hole of studio picture paradigms . hancock and eastwood may very well have made the best adaptation of midnight possible within a studio system . the acting is first-rate from top to bottom ( including a sly and charismatic debut by the lady chablis as him/herself ) , eastwood's technical team delivers typical excellence , and many of the book's best situations are re-created with sharp humor . there's just something vaguely unsatisfying about midnight , and not just in comparison to its source material . this story cries out for a less conventional treatment , though it's still fairly unconventional by most standards . the makers of midnight had their heart in the right place , but the result teases with the promise of an off-beat exploration it delivers only sporadically . perhaps the answer to that screenwriting assignment is even trickier than the question . you don't . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1615,"screenplay : david franzoni . producers : debbie allen , steven spielberg and colin wilson . director : steven spielberg . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 153 minutes . amistad is no schindler's list . think it unfair if you must , but steven spielberg is going to face comparisons like that for the rest of his film-making career . in the case of amistad , those comparisons are going to be even harder to avoid , given the proximity in time ( it's spielberg's first "" serious "" film since the oscar-winning schindler in 1993 ) , the subject matter ( the trials of an oppressed people ) and the situational familiarity ( if it's the december after a spielberg dinosaur movie , it must be time for a spielberg fact-based historical epic ) . spielberg may never make another schindler's list -- even the most successful home run hitter isn't likely to knock _two_ world series-winning grand slams -- but he did raise his personal bar . now that we know what he's capable of , we're not going to let him get away with choosing less than stellar material . amistad is hardly a half-hearted effort ; in fact , there are a couple of scenes which rank with spielberg's best work as a director . it is , however , a piece of material which ends up providing far less impact than it should . amistad is at its best when cinque is telling his story , allowing the electrifying performance of djimon hounsou to take center stage . though he utters only half a dozen english words through the entire film , hounsou's impassioned work brings to life an intelligent man trying to understand a thoroughly perplexing new world . if it had ever been made clear that amistad is cinque's story , the film could have been a masterpiece . instead , david franzoni's script allows too many characters to flirt with the impression that the story is all about them . franzoni also tosses off one of the story's most crucial pieces of historical trivia -- that while slavery was still legal in 1839 , capturing africans was not -- as though it were common knowledge . the "" amistad "" case was a messy piece of history , but the script only serves to make it messier , obscuring the human drama in a muddle of over-plotting . when amistad does give the africans' plight its undivided attention , it's a gripping piece of film-making . as he did with the horror of the concentration camps , spielberg provides unflinching images of the horrors of slave ships without exploiting those horrors . he also creates a splendid sequence in which one african's bible lesson to cinque is cross-cut with one man's struggle of christian conscience . if only there had been more of those moments , more singularity of purpose , more complexity of character . spielberg brought in schindler scribe steven zaillian to do some doctoring on the amistad script , but the doctor couldn't turn merely good into great . amistad is a solidly made film . it's just no . . . well , you know . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1616,"for what it's worth , i correctly guessed the identity of the killer in scream 2 . . . well , sort of . i suppose i should feel satisfied at my own cleverness , since dimension and the makers of scream 2 have put so much effort into keeping that piece of information secret . even more so than in the original scream , writer kevin williamson goes to ridiculous extremes to keep the audience guessing whodunnit , so ridiculous that the film becomes too focused on the one thing which should have been least important . as a horror film , it's a solid piece of work ; as a satire , it's frequently hilarious . as a mystery , it tries way , way , _way_ too hard . jermaine ? marlon ? tito ? if you can keep the suspects straight without a press kit , more power to you . williamson often seems so concerned with turning every live body in sight into a potential suspect that he lets that question overwhelm everything else . it all builds to a revelatory climax drawn out so long past the point of diminishing returns -- loaded with confessions , motives and false finishes -- that you can't even see the point of diminishing returns from there . i'm being a bit harder on scream 2 than it might deserve , because that one big problem may be the only real problem . williamson's satirical darts are expertly targeted , not just at horror film cliches or the "" inevitable inferiority "" of sequels , but at the original film itself . the film-within-a-film "" stab "" provides a few wonderful moments , as do the audience reactions to some of the more improbable situations ( e . g . the dialogue is sharp , smart and not at all afraid of naming names ( cox's "" friends "" co-stars david schwimmer and jennifer aniston are among those skewered ) , a perfect counter-point to wes craven's crafty suspense scenes . if you're not ready to crawl out of your skin when campbell crawls across the unconscious form of her tormentor , it's time for a pulse check . scream 2 is so entertaining both as a chiller and as a chuckler that the lack of attention to those elements is a frustration . kevin williamson is carving out a new genre for himself which certainly seems to be finding an audience -- both screams and i know what you did last summer take off with the radical notion that umasking the monster is a good idea . there's just something deflating about a tense , comic horror film that turns into a scooby-doo episode . williamson has too much talent as a writer of comedy to keep getting side-tracked by conventions , even if they're conventions he's helping to re-create . scare us or make us laugh . . . we know you can do both . just keep the mystery machine parked at the curb . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1617,"of all the reasons i was pleasantly surprised by good will hunting -- and there were several -- the easiest to identify was its subversive awareness of its own genre . i called long ago for a moratorium on physician-heal-thyself psychiatrists as a cinematic type ; therapy sessions as revelatory contrivance seemed just as ready for mothballs . good will hunting can't possibly steer clear of every pitfall associated with therapy-centered drama , but it's conscious enough of those pitfalls to provide a goofy sense of originality . the script , by damon and his co-star and real-life buddy affleck , keeps the dialogue between will and sean generally smart and smart-alecky ( particularly sharp was a pastoral scene which will describes as a "" taster's choice moment between the guys "" ) . the arc of their relationship is convincing and patiently developed , with williams and damon sharing an impressive chemistry . the performances are consistently strong enough ( even robin williams in his "" bearded , ergo serious "" mode ) to carry good will hunting through its inevitable dips into confrontation , as well as a running time which could have used a judicious twenty minutes of trimming . strongest of all is damon himself in a dazzlingly charismatic piece of screen acting . both believably brilliant and convincingly rough around the edges , damon avoids the too-common actor's trap of white-washing his character's dark side . it's too conventional an instinct for a director who has rarely done anything the conventional way , offering damon a protection he simply doesn't need . as both actor and writer , matt damon gives good will hunting energy , soul and a welcome desire to avoid trite situations . it's a rare drama which satisfies without pandering , a feel-good , heal-good session which gives you just a little hope that every trip to the couch doesn't have to be a trip into cliche-land . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1618,"their earnest , well-crafted stories of folks caught up in the turbulence of political violence have moved many viewers to heap adjectives of praise upon their films . and while all this occurs , i find myself sitting and thinking , "" you know , it was good , but . . . "" sheridan and george's latest collaboration , the boxer , falls into a very similar category . there are always plenty of things to like about a sheridan film , most notably his ability to create a vibrant sense of place . the divided belfast of the boxer is a startling image , with its physical wall dividing the people even more concretely than the differing ideologies . the insanity and self-perpetuating violence of the irish conflict are starkly portrayed , with more ambiguity surrounding the question of right and wrong than most films on the subject -- including sheridan and george's own previous films -- have managed to explore . for all its welcome complexity of theme , however , the boxer tends to drift in the exploration of its main characters . nowhere is this more evident than in the love story between danny and maggie , a star-crossed romance which feels more obligatory than well-developed . furtive glances and snatches of conversation establish tension between them , but their connection is never entirely convincing . in one sense , it's an effective device which turns him into an abstract rallying point for the ira rather than an individual human being . none of which is to suggest that the performances aren't strong from top to bottom , because they are . daniel day-lewis brings a resigned dignity to danny ; his unwillingness to return to the ira's ways seems as much a result of fatigue than moral scruple . their stories always hold your attention , but they never engross the way great film stories do . perhaps my sense in the boxer , and with in the name of the father and some mother's son for that matter , is that sheridan and george are more interested in making a point than making a movie . the result is a cerebral film with too little gut-level emotion . sheridan and george are good film-makers , but they could be great if they were as attentive to their people as to their politics . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1620,"director : peter hewitt . mpaa rating : pg ( mild vulgarity ) running time : 83 minutes . the borrowers is the kind of goofy charmer of a family adventure film hollywood should be able to make it its sleep , if only it would bother . the premise posits the existence of 4-inch-tall beings called borrowers who live beneath the floorboards and in the walls of human homes , making their living off the bits and pieces we always seem to be misplacing -- a loose button for a plate here , a sock for a bed there . first : why can't more films employ special effects with the borrowers' unobtrusive whimsy ? visual effects supervisor peter chiang , production designer gemma jackson and cinematographers john fenner and trevor brooker have joined forces to fashion a warm , visually enthralling world for the film's characters , in which the oversized props and camera trickery serve a purpose besides calling attention to themselves . humans and borrowers interact convincingly , creating wild and thoroughly entertaining set pieces . it's a great-looking , lively piece of work with neat bits of throwaway business -- a monopoly card hung on the clocks' wall like a pop art showpiece -- and a crisp pace . the second , more disspiriting question : when and why did it become obligatory for every children's film to aim for cheap chuckles from bodily functions ? for most of its running time , the borrowers' slapstick comedy is disarming in its cartoonish innocence -- foam in the face , cheese on the head , exaggerated electrocutions and pratfalls . why , then , do we need to see peagreen immersed in a massive pile of dog droppings ? why the running gag about a flatulent hound ? is it really so difficult to fill 83 minutes with entertainment a parent can share with a child sans embarassment ? there's so much immagination throughout the borrowers that it's even more disappointing to find it swinging so typically below the belt . there's nothing particularly ground-breaking about the basic story-line of the borrowers , which melds the recent mouse hunt with a teen alienation sub-plot as arietty longs to find other borrowers . the appeal of the film comes not from narrative wackiness , but from the complementary pairing of john goodman's snarling villainy with the storybook delights of the film's overall look and feel . sure , it stumbles occasionally in the ways its most like most ostensibly "" family films "" of recent years . it's the ways in which the borrowers is least like its genre cousins which should make it satisfying matinee viewing . this is fantasy escapism which doesn't make you feel stupid for escaping . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1621,"i wanted to like eve's bayou even more than i did , for many of the same reasons i suspect some critics have been overly effusive in their praise . after all , here was a film with an african-american cast in which race was largely irrelevant to the story . here was a film directed by an african-american woman , adding some much-needed pigment and estrogen to a club even more conspicuously male than it is conspicuously white . here was a first time film-maker , and a pretty decent one at that , adding the "" excitement of discovery "" factor . and here was a film which was actually _about_ something . kasi lemmons' writing and directing debut certainly deserves better than to be singled out for the race either of lemmons or her cast . far from being a simple domestic drama , eve's bayou delves into the complex subjects of memory and perception . events are constantly being revisited and re-evaluated , in scenes crafted by lemmons with a seductive ambiguity . in the film's finest moment , eve's aunt mozelle ( debbi morgan ) recalls a painful moment as a reflection in a mirror , moving from observer to participant in a few short steps . it's a lyrical and thought-provoking film lemmons has fashioned , in which the interpretation of events becomes ever more challenging . lemmons does such a fine job of introducing ideas and creating images that the more fundamental failings of eve's bayou become all the more disappointing . the narrative grabs at bits and pieces of atmosphere -- period art direction , voodoo curses , french dialects -- without ever really settling into a convincing sense of place . as for the much-lauded acting . . . well , morgan is certainly solid as the solemn mozelle . other performances are far more sporadic , from a nondescript lynn whitfield to a bug-eyed diahann carroll as a cackling voodoo priestess . make no mistake , eve's bayou is a good film : deeply felt , consistently intriguing and often visually striking . it's also a wonderful thing that a female african-american first-time film-maker has done such impressive work . even adding those things together doesn't make eve's bayou a great film , however . certainly i'll be looking forward to lemmon's next project , when that raw talent as a director and passion as a story-teller join forces with a bit more focus and discipline . then it might be time to start talking about lemmons as an a-list director , irrespective of race , or gender , or how many films she has made . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1622,"producers : marshall herkovitz , edward zwick , arnon milchan , sarah caplan . director : marshall herskovitz . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , sexual situations , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 115 minutes . for quite a while , dangerous beauty tempts you with an irresistable combination of compelling substance in a glorious package . . . quite fitting , considering the premise . yes , even the now-married marco . if you smell a tale of degradation and class warfare in the making , sniff again . dangerous beauty actually paints quite a rosy portrait of veronica's life while presenting an intriguing history lesson in gender politics . when the other option is mute insignificance , prostitution suddenly seems considerably less cruel a fate . director marshall herskovitz wraps this tale in enough style , romance and humor that it's usually as entertaining as it is provocative . sumptuous production design renders 16th century venice in romanticized colors and dark interiors , accentuated by lucianna arrighi's marvelous costumes . the central pairing of sewell and mccormack generates heat and tension as the two characters negotiate the tricky parameters of their relationship . then again , mccormack never hits a single false note in her performance , her expressive face registering emotions ranging from innocence to astonishment to wicked wit . for well over three quarters of its running time , dangerous beauty is an unqualified pleasure . you can feel free to leave the theater when the plague strikes fair venice , because at that point it quickly degenerates into thematic proclamations and over-wrought courtroom confrontations . after offering well over an hour of subversive notions cloaked in costume drama , jeannine dominy's script plants veronica on a soapbox for the deliver of an i-am-renaissance-woman-hear-me-roar manifesto , inspiring all and sundry to leap to their feet in an "" oh captain , my captain "" show of solidarity . don't let those cheap theatrics wash the good taste of the rest of dangerous beauty out of your mouth . mccormack's radiant performance and an unusual exploration of primitive feminism give it the real punch its forced conclusion tries too hard to provide . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1623,"director : richard linklater . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( frequent profanity , violence ) running time : 122 minutes . i've got to be honest with you : if i were producing a "" true crime "" bio-pic , richard linklater would not be my first choice as director . in fact , i'm not sure he'd make the top fifty . not exactly the stuff of which blazing shootouts and narrow getaways are made , is it ? as one might expect , there is an amiable , unhurried pace to richard linklater's the newton boys . the surprise is that it turns out to be one of the film's most appealing qualities . from the opening credits , it is clear that linklater is aiming for an old-fashioned whimsy in his telling of the tale . the title cards are styled after silent films , with "" the players "" introduced in sienna-tinted head shots , tipping their hats to the camera . the newton boys generally paints its protagonists as light-hearted , almost casual outlaws , polite young men who happened to be very good at robbing banks and milked one effective modus operandi for all it was worth . even the obligatory montage sequence , spinning newspaper headlines and all , is edited with a less frantic sense of urgency than you might expect . the newton boys is such a lightweight bit of history that it sometimes threatens to float away entirely whenever there's not a robbery going on . the characters are energetically portrayed by the top-notch cast , but they're little more than a token trait a piece -- joe is the religious one , brentwood is the cautious one , jess is the cocky drunken one , dock is . . . well , the _other_ cocky drunken one . even then , the attempts to flesh out his life -- a romance with a single mother ( julianna margulies ) , ill-fated attempts to funnel his ill-gotten gains into legitimate businesses -- feel half-hearted and only sporadically effective . still , there's something undeniably charming about the newton boys , some intangible alchemy between the actors' obvious enjoyment of their roles and a story with no greater agenda than spotlighting a previously unknown bit of americana . two hours may be a bit too much time to support the substance of the newton boys , but if you've indulged linklater's episodic films in the past , you probably won't be disappointed by his willingness to wander down the side roads of a story . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1624,"i recall being only mildly impressed with david mamet's house of games when i first saw it a decade ago , despite general critical acclaim . sure , it was a meticulously crafted intellectual puzzle , and , even more impressive , it was a puzzle which didn't fall apart completely as you were thinking about it on the way home . with lindsey crouse serving serving as its remote heroine , however , all its unpredictable twists felt like they were taking place in a vacuum , leaving little reason to care about anyone in the story . crafty , yes , but soulless . five years of wading through cinema at its most mind-numbing has given me a new appreciation for meticulously crafted intellectual puzzles , even if they are of the soulless variety . mamet's new psychological mystery the spanish prisoner , a thoroughly intriguing cinematic engine , definitely falls into that category . unfortunately for joe , little of that milk looks likely to end up in his cup . it's best to cut off any plot summary at this point , lest certain turns of narrative be inadvertently revealed . suffice it to say that the spanish prisoner tackles familiar mamet subjects like breakdowns in trust and deceptive appearances , accompanied by the familiar-bordering-on-cliche staccato rhythms of mamet's dialogue . it also features crisp pacing courtesy of editor barbara tulliver , and yet another insinuating score from the gifted carter burwell . most significantly , it features a story which manipulates in all the best senses of the word . in an era where most films leave you suspecting the re-writes had been commissioned from a room full of chimps , the spanish prisoner treats an audience with respect -- no cheap tricks , no flip-a-coin-to-pick-the-killer endings , just a smart and surprising entertainment . there's a lot to admire about the construction of the spanish prisoner , but it shouldn't be so difficult to find a sympathetic human protagonist to guide a story like this . while steve martin does marvelously cagey work as the mysterious jimmy -- he's one of the few cast members who seems to have a grip on mamet's style -- scott feels as though he's being pulled grudgingly through the story because _somebody's_ got to be the hero . even with its lack of a vibrant hero , i can't be too hard on the spanish prisoner . in fact , that absence only really started to bother me on the way home , which is usually where the plots of such films start to bother me . i do wish that mamet , who clearly has mastered the art of plotting , could make his films as emotionally compelling as they are intellectually satisfying . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1625,"screenplay : peter howitt . director : peter howitt . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 105 minutes . how much does that one , seemingly inconsequential variable change the woman's life ? sliding doors is a gimmick film , the gimmick being that it allows us to watch both alternate courses determined by that one moment . sliding doors works on enough different levels that i wonder whether it succeeds because of its gimmick or in spite of it . as a straightforward relationship comedy , it's generally delightful , crafted by writer/director peter howitt with unusually sharp comic dialogue . the principal characters are uniformly well-drawn , from the unsteady confidence of paltrow's helen , to the genial wit of hannah's james , to the confused and almost sympathetic philandering of lynch's gerry . even a minor supporting performance from douglas mcferran as james' no-nonsense best friend shines with energy and humor . howitt explores familiar modern romance territory , but does it with enough intelligence and commitment to the characters that it feels fresh . of course , he's also playing an extended game of "" what if "" , one which sometimes intrudes on the perfectly enjoyable conventional narrative . though rookie director howitt handles the interplay between the story-lines with surprising deftness , the shifts from one plot to the other often deny both plots momentum . nowhere is this more evident than during a pair of climactic confrontations , where howitt cuts back and forth to the point of distraction . he may be intending to build tension , but instead he builds frustration , using neck-stapping editing to show the pivotal moments occurring simultaneously while sacrificing dramatic urgency . a version of sliding doors which offered a simple , smartly-written romantic triangle might have been just as winning without all the fuss . it's also true that something would have been lost . though at first glance sliding doors seems to flirt with the celebration of fate and destiny so popular in recent love stories , howitt offers something a bit more thought-provoking than that . by allowing us to get to know the characters -- and helen in particular -- as well as he does , he gives us much more reason to believe that destiny is simply the tendency of people to act according to their character . helen's determination , pride and sense of self-worth are what make it likely that any course of her life will have a happy ending , not the capricious opening or closing of a pair of sliding doors on a train . the film may be a bit of speculative gimmickry , but it's also something more -- and less -- than that . in some alternate reality , peter howitt may have made sliding doors a romantic comedy without a gimmick . like helen's life , it's hard to know for sure which version would have been more engaging and appealing . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1627,"screenplay : rita hsiao , christopher sanders , philip lazebnik , raymond singer & eugenia bostwick-singer . mpaa rating : g ( mild cartoon violence ) running time : 90 minutes . ever since the little mermaid re-vitalized disney's animation efforts in 1989 , the studio's annual animated feature has been one of the year's most scrutinized releases . now that no one expects $300 million every time out of the gate , maybe disney will get the credit it is due for pushing the limits of animated film-making . mulan defies convention yet again , bypassing the well-trodden ground of western literature and mythology to tell a 2 , 000-year-old tale from chinese legend . the "" yentl goes to china "" plot line is basic disney stuff on a certain level -- yearning young protagonist , societal restrictions , complicated romance , lessons in personal growth and tolerance of individuality all around . it's a bit surprising then to find the set-up as drawn-out as it is in mulan . though there's a bit of comic relief in the bumbling encounter with the matchmaker , the first half hour is largely devoted to character development and motivation -- good things on general principle , of course , but over-indulged here to contribute to an extremely slow start . it doesn't help that the early songs by david zippel and matthew wilder -- yes , the same matthew wilder of "" break my stride "" fame -- are the kind of uninspired post-howard ashman ditties which make you wish someone could get over the broadway musical paradigm for animated features . that opening 25-minute stretch is plenty earnest , but it's hardly confidence-inspiring . when mulan finally does hit its own stride , beginning with the visually striking sequence in which mulan leaves home , it's a solid and energetic piece of work . the script incorporates comic relief into its redemption story much better than pocahontas or hunchback wedged in its token gags , providing a fine showcase for eddie murphy's fast-talking dragon and harvey fierstein's entertainingly incongruous voicing of a he-man soldier . the musical numbers also pick up steam in the second half of the film , perhaps not providing break-out hummable hits but at least setting a firm musical tone . mostly , however , the film becomes a dazzling adventure , highlighted by a spectacular battle sequence between huns and chinese soldiers in a snowy mountain pass . by the time the sharply-paced climactic confrontation rolls around , with its balanced doses of humor and suspense , you may have forgotten mulan's less-than-stellar start . i suppose what gives mulan an added kick are the touches which stray from familiar disney patterns . notably , the villainous shan-yu remains in the background for most of the film as a mysterious genuine threat -- no comic sidekicks , no songs , no glib one-liners . that leaves more time to develop mulan's resourcefulness , creating a smart and savvy heroine who happens to be an asian woman , a rarity not just in animated films but in films of any kind . this may not be the kind of cuddly , inviting film of which stuffed animal sales and video buying binges are made ; indeed , it may be over the head of kids much younger than 7 or 8 . fact is , it doesn't exactly warrant that ubiquitous disney label of "" masterpiece .

"" and yes , it does give mulder and scully a bit of quality personal time together . but does it throw open every door and tie up every loose end ? please . . . you'd be more likely to find the cigarette-smoking man chomping away on nicorette gum . yet there's something strange about moving the show's moody claustrophobia to the big screen . cinematographer ward russell maintains the high quality which has long made "" the x-files "" one of the best-looking shows on television , but the problem is less one of style than it is one of scale . blown up larger than life , the conspirators seem less sinister , the situations less sublimely creepy . the atmosphere may leave some fans wondering who took their mulder and scully and dropped them into a summer action blockbuster . which brings us to question number two : how does the x files play if you've never seen mulder and scully before in your life ? quite simply , it's an sharp suspense thriller which sets up the characters and situations with impressive effectiveness and economy . director rob bowman complements the necessary exposition with energetic , visually arresting set pieces , creating a visceral entertainment as satisfying as anything else you'll find in a multiplex . though "" x-files "" novices may be left behind with references to the lone gunmen and mulder's notoriously deadpan demeanor , it doesn't take familiarity with the series to get a charge out of the well-paced chases , or a chuckle out of mulder using a poster from a certain 1996 blockbuster as an impromptu urinal . it's important for those viewers to know that they can have a perfectly enjoyable time with the x files and still not understand exactly what's going on after the film has ended . in fact , the x files may work best as a cunning lure , drawing potential new viewers into the fold with a final shot that might as well have included a "" to be continued . . . "" caption . regular viewers , on the other hand , have seen better stories with these characters . maybe that should have been the real first question : how do you make a unique film event from a series where the quality already regularly surpasses most theatrical films ? the truth is only partially out there in the x files , and the truth is that x-philes with high expectations may be much harder to please than the average summer movie-goer . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1629,"in contemporary popular art , there's a very fine line between sheer brilliance and head-smacking pretentiousness . it's a line most visionary film directors flirt with on a regular basis , to the point of tying said line into the occasional sheepshank knots . it almost seems as though , for all their periodic misfires , film-makers like david lynch , terry gilliam and stanley kubrick have no choice but to take you places no one else can or will take you . you suspect that even though the film you are watching may not be great , the creative mind behind it could be . darren aronofsky's debut feature pi may not be a work of pure originality -- the echoes of lynch's eraserhead are too distinct -- but i can virtually guarantee you won't see anything else like it this year . at its core , pi is an icarus fable of a man reaching for knowledge beyond his capacity to handle it , with a side order of cyber-era isolation cautionary tale . aronofsky uses voice-over narration effectively to get us inside max's seizure-wracked head ( with superb musical assistance from clint mansell of pop will eat itself ) , showing us the world as an actualized paranoid fantasy viewed through a self-imposed cage of computers . pi might have been a frighteningly engrossing character study if only sean gullette had been able to match the intensity of the material . his steven wright-as-computer geek demeanor suggests a typical socially-challenged nerd more often than a man spinning into madness ; though he didn't need to bug out his eyes and foam at the mouth , he did need to place max close enough to the edge for us to see the bottom from there . gullette's competent but distant performance lowers the stakes of pi's twisted conspiracy theoretics . yes , he does stretch too hard at times to achieve his lynchian vibe -- grainy black-and-white photography , a mysterious sticky substance , blinding flashes of light and a brain covered with ants do not necessarily a profound statement make . but who else would construct a psychological thriller around large number theory , wall street and the kaballah ? who else would create visuals as distinct as max's techno-organic apartment , or make an audience squirm so violently at the do-not-try-this-at-home use of a certain power tool ? and who else has demonstrated the cinematic instincts to turn a scene of a man writing down numbers into something more tension-packed than a dozen hollywood chase scenes . the most obvious antecedent may be lynch , but even lynch's hypnotic images have rarely been this kinetic . though aronofsky may have been limited by finances , available talent or technical constraints , he has created a work which leaves you hungry for what he could do next . pi is the creation of that one film-maker in a hundred who seems unlikely to make movies by the numbers . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1630,"if you've ever seen or read an interview with vincent gallo , it's probably obvious why he decided to make his own movie : other people seem to irritate him to distraction . so rather than make a film with all the folks he holds in such contempt , gallo decided to do it all himself . wearing that many hats should qualify him as some sort of rack . fortunately , gallo has the head and the talent to pull it off for the most part . a visually provocative if occasionally under-developed character study , buffalo '66 tells the story of billy brown ( gallo ) , a lifetime loser from buffalo , ny . the premise sounds like the set-up for farce or black comedy , but buffalo '66 is actually a sharply-observed character study . gallo's billy is a portrait in emotional immaturity , his child-like name indicative of his inability to act like an adult . gallo is superb in front of the camera , but he's just as impressive behind it . typically , actors-turned-directors point their camera at the actors and let them do their thing . there's nothing typical about gallo , however . his direction tends towards the showy , but the show always reaches for a specific emotion . with the instincts of a visual artist , gallo makes buffalo '66 undeniably visual . it's only as a screenwriter that gallo comes up wanting . as complex and well-developed as billy may be , layla is that sketchy . the talented ricci tries to invest some real humanity in the character , but too often she's little more than a powder blue baby-doll fantasy . that choice only makes sense if buffalo '66 is an elaborate surrealist fable , which would negate much of the compelling pathos in billy's character . still , it's hard not to notice how much more gallo does right with buffalo '66 . he may have stretched his diverse talents thin , but he proved he could do it his way . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1631,"screenplay : don roos . director : don roos . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 100 minutes . the opposite of sex may actually be too limiting a title for screenwriter don roos' tart-tongued directorial debut . after winding its way through relationship comedy , road picture grit and a dozen genre stops in between , it turns out to be the opposite of nearly everything it first appears to be , including : long-time readers know of my disdain for voice-over narration as a substitute for effective film storytelling . the opposite of sex opens with a warning from dedee truitt ( christina ricci ) , the 16-year-old vixen at the center of the story : "" if you're one of those people who don't like movies where some person you can't see talks the whole time and covers up the holes in the plot . . . then like most of dedee's comments , that one isn't particularly trustworthy . roos turns dedee's bitchy , politically-incorrect narration into an effective tool for understanding characters and subverting expectations , enough to make me soften my absolutist anti-narration stance . that's not to say that the film is all about caustic indifference . in fact , it's . . . roos has little interest in wallowing in indie-pic nihilism . despite the multitude of quirky touches , the opposite of sex is a surprisingly human story of people for whom sex is either frightening , or manipulative , or a substitute for something more substantial . playing a character so profoundly disappointed by life that everything and everyone similarly disappoints her , she moves and speaks like a perpetually constricted sphincter muscle . it's a brutally funny and quite touching performance , one of the year's best . it also makes it clear that the opposite of sex is . . . for some reason , roos ( single white female , boys on the side ) has generally written much more compelling female characters than male characters through his career . even lyle lovett , as the gentle sheriff with a crush on lucia , is given too little shading for the important role he ultimately plays . only martin donovan , always adept at fleshing out minimalist characterizations with piercing glances , emerges fully-formed . roos covers up several weaknesses with his sharp dialogue , but he can't hide the sketchy male roles , nor the fact that the opposite of sex is . . . every once in a while , roos gets overtly cinematic on us -- a slow pan after a gunshot is heard , a sentimental montage of bill after matt leaves . otherwise , the opposite of sex might as well be a stage play , a collection of static medium compositions of characters in conversation . fortunately , those conversations are full of quotable lines and keen insights into the way we use and abuse sex , and vice-versa . don't expect dumb comedy , gratuitous titillation or cheap sentimentality from the opposite of sex . you're going to get the opposite of all that . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1632," i don't believe in fate ,  says erin castleton ( hope davis ) , the wistful heroine looking for love in next stop wonderland , but _someone_ calling the shots on contemporary romantic comedy sure does . earlier this year , sliding doors offered yet another speculative stab at how and why we meet our soulmates . something in the zeitgeist has film-makers falling over themselves to convince us that mr . or ms . right is out there , somewhere , just waiting for us to go to the right party or step on the right elevator . next stop wonderland falls into that category , but only in the most nominal sense . the reason next stop wonderland never feels exactly like a fated romance is that it feels so grounded in the simple reality of its protagonist . it's as complete a female characterization as we've seen this year -- she's smart , clever , just vulnerable enough that you feel for her , just tough enough that you trust her . anderson directs with a 1990s woody allen vibe , complete with jump edits and hand-held camera work , yet the film never comes off as derivative of either the allen oeuvre or other sleepless-style comedies . a character who grabs your interest can do that for a story . gelfant is appealing in a low-key way , but he never gets the audience as emotionally invested in alan's hopes and dreams as davis does in erin's . the odd fringe benefit of this imbalance is that it takes the focus off the question that dogged other films employing this gimmick : why should we think these two people belong together ? the coda which has been added since the film screened at the sundance film festival makes that concern even more central . the ending is no longer happy just because these two people meet , but because it looks like they could be happy together , and davis's delightful performance invests us in her happiness . next stop wonderland is a sweet and entertaining fairy tale not just because she finds prince charming , but because the one fate we care about -- erin's fate -- is the only one the film is realy concerned with . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1633,"screenplay : david levien and brian koppelman . director : john dahl . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 119 minutes . in the ongoing tastes-great-less-filling verbal war of attrition between john q . critic and joe b . average movie-goer , a crucial common ground often gets overlooked . on the same fundamental level , every one of us loves to be taken somewhere we've never been before , to be told a story in a way it's never been told before . at their most engrossing , movies offer the giddy thrill of the utterly new . at its most engrossing , that's exactly what rounders offers : a fascinating glimpse inside the world of high-stakes poker . and oh , how much we learn while he does so . writers david levien and brian koppelman use damon's narration much the same way ray liotta's narration was used in goodfellas -- as a sociology lesson . it's utterly fascinating , whether the setting is a back alley card room or a gaudy atlantic city casino . damon anchors the story in a solid performance as a man beginning to understand that he has a gift , not a problem . though hooked on the thrill of winning , he's no different than a performer hooked on the thrill of an audience's reaction . rounders has such a solid hook that it's disappointing to watch it drift into a handful of distracting sub-plots . even the old-school chemistry between damon and norton -- full of almost-charming , can't-help-myself sleaze as the compulsively crooked worm -- feels less genuine than it should . if anything positive comes out of these half-formed relationships , it's the sense that mike's best friend is really the game . damon's charisma is never more potent than in the climactic showdown with the russian gangster who beat him in the game that broke him ( john malkovich , employing his dead eyes to perfect effect and a boris badinov accent with considerably less success ) . for that confrontation , the narration grows conspicuously silent at key points , trusting you to grasp the game to which you have been introduced . viewers who used to think of poker simply as gambling may have to re-think their position after sitting through rounders . this tale shows us a different world entirely -- the world of card-player as tortured artist . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1634,"screenplay : todd alcott and chris weitz & paul weitz . mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , violent situations ) running time : 83 minutes . so dreamworks' antz gets to be first out of the gate in the computer-animated insect sweepstakes , beating disney/pixar's a bug's life to the screen by a good two months . the folks at dreamworks probably felt that meant they could set the standard and avoid comparisons , but that's not entirely true . disney's 1995 toy story became the first , best standard-bearer , a wonderfully witty adventure which established that no amount of visual virtuosity could push aside the power of a great script . there was little doubt that three years of technological innovation would make antz more spectacular to look at . the question was whether these anthropomorphized insects would be asked to carry a story that felt like twenty times their body weight . it looks like the film-makers behind antz learned the right lessons from toy story . antz may not be in toy story's league when it comes to charm and ingenuity , but it's a clever and appealing piece of work in its own right . the goofy socio-political overtones of z's struggle for individuality are good for a few chuckles , though it's not entirely clear from one moment to the next what the "" message "" is . at other times , the needs of the many are shown to outweigh the needs of the few . and that's not the only place where the story feels less than cohesive . sub-plots abound , many of which fill time without moving the story anywhere . the ideas for individual scenes play much more effectively in the moment than they do upon reflection , where they don't feel completely unified . then again , it's hard not to be caught up in the moment while watching antz . the visuals are nothing short of spectacular , in terms of both scale and individual detail . when thousands of ants form a wrecking ball or a column to serve a unified purpose , thousands of individual limbs and antennae waving , the effect is dazzling . there are also some effectively creepy images of a war between ants and acid-spewing termites ( the kind which might spook youngsters ) . perhaps even more breath-taking are the facial expressions created for the characters . the movements and reactions are so complete that every ant becomes real on the screen . with so much attention lavished on giving the characters personality , antz never feels merely showy , as impressive as it is from start to finish . not that the animators were solely responsible for giving the characters personality . antz boasts an impressive cast of voice talent , from hackman as the eugenically-inclined dictator-in-waiting to christopher walken as he morally ambivalent henchman , from stallone deftly playing good-natured lug to dan aykroyd and jane curtin as a pair of wasp-ish wasps named chip and muffy . but the star of the show is woody allen , bringing his inimitable , anxiety-ridden nebbishness to z . some of his lines are pure vintage woody ( on whether he "" laughs in the face of death "" : "" actually , i generally . . . make sarcastic remarks behind death's back "" ) , which makes it even more of an incongruous pleasure thinking of him as a romantic action hero . his voice performance is one of several reasons antz is plenty of fun , if often in an inside-jokey , over the head of kids kind of way . as a story it's uneven , but it still satisfies ; it may not be toy story , but few things are . and it has succeeded at setting a reasonably high bar for the next computer-generated bug film to jump over with all six legs . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1635,"screenplay : stanley tucci . director : stanley tucci . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , sexual situations ) running time : 102 minutes . it has long been one of my most closely-held dramatic axioms that there is no middle ground when it comes to the execution of farce . either a writer and director get it , or they don't . if they get it , the result is exhilarating comic brilliance . if they don't get it , the result is nearly unendurable . and never , i believed , could the twain meet . another false dichotomy bites the dust . writer/director stanley tucci's the impostors is old-fashioned farce that floats along amusingly , yet only occasionally hits the high notes that turn chuckles into gut-busters . it's a classic screwball farce set-up , which tucci cleverly chooses to place in the classic screwball farce era of the 1930s . opening with a great bit of pantomime accompanying the opening credits , tucci establishes arthur and maurice as protagonists in the mold of the classic silent film comedians -- lovable losers , not above a bit of duplicity if it suits their purposes , yet ultimately heroic ( and , in particular , chivalric ) . the pre-shipboard scenes , though little more than isolated comedy sketches , do a nice job of showing the chemistry between the two . by the time the intercontinental hits the open sea , tucci and platt's starving , utterly sincere artistes have generated plenty of good will . i was ready for the impostors to soar once arthur and maurice began dashing from stateroom to stateroom ; instead , it levels off at a pleasant cruising altitude . tucci populates the ship with plenty of goofy characters -- a fascistic head steward ( campbell scott ) , a suicidal entertainer incongruously named happy ( steve buscemi ) , a wallflower heiress ( hope davis ) , a deposed monarch-in-hiding ( isabella rossellini ) -- clearly intended to make arthur and maurice look like the sane ones in a sea of chaos . yet he doesn't allow these characters to function in scenes that build comic momentum . tucci's gags are mostly of the hit-and-run variety . while there are a few admittedly hilarious ones , they seem like wasted opportunities to do what great farce does best : have each comic moment draw from the previous comic moment , and lead into the next comic moment , in a hysterically unstoppable domino effect . those missed opportunities are most evident when tucci _does_ allow a scene to build momentum . such fourth wall-breaking captures farce at its anything-for-a-laugh finest . more often , tucci goes for the gentle touch which worked so well in big night . as frisky and unpretentious a comedy as the impostors is , it traffics in an unnecessarily restrained level of lunacy . tucci's spin on monkey business has plenty of funny business , but it doesn't let anarchy reign quite as often as it should . it's that rarest of comedic animals : the merely-good farce . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

"" pleasantville digs into the barely-concealed anxiety and xenophobia at the heart of so much political retro-think , yet that's not even the film's most daring idea . ross has the guts to take on the notion of original sin itself , suggesting that the very passion and curiosity which lead to upheaval in paradise are also what make us most alive and most human , giving color to an otherwise monochromatic existence . it's unfortunate that ross gets a bit too self-congratulatory about his social satire , particularly in the final half-hour . as tensions build in pleasantville , the battle becomes a clash between those characters still in black-and-white and those whose new , life-changing experiences have left them "" colored "" -- and that may be the _least_ consistently underlined point . pleasantville is a funny and thoughtful film , the kind that works best before it starts tattooing the moral of the story across your backbrain . it's plenty entertaining just watching the mythology of the "" good old days "" laid bare , exposed as a comforting fiction far removed from a world where coping with change is more productive than demonizing it . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1637,"making a movie about racism is virtually a no-win proposition . ninety-nine percent of the time , a film-maker will spend two hours making it excruciatingly clear that racism is bad , inspiring either righteous nods of approval or rolled eyes at the explication of the self-evident . we all feel good abour ourselves as right-thinking people , but we get the point already . what more is there to say if you're only making a cinematic sermon for the choir ? it's a risky endeavor -- you might find people chastising you for not making racism obviously bad _enough_ -- but it's the most potentially compelling . for all its flaws , american history x grabs you because it throws you inside the racist mind more effectively than any film i can remember . the center of that exploration is edward norton's creepy-smart performance as derek vinyard , a young skinhead we meet in two incarnations . those flashback sequences are by far the most effective , photographed by director tony kaye in icy black-and-white . remarkably , they begin from the premise that derek and danny are both intelligent rather than red-neck morons . derek is chilling because he's not merely spewing bile and epithets -- he's making racism _make sense_ like a master rhetorician . it's that kind of audience-baiting that makes portions of american history x so disturbing , particularly in a neighborhood basketball game sequence where kaye masterfully manipulates viewers into siding with derek and his skinhead cronies . the second shows us the reason for derek's incarceration -- the murder of two black carjackers -- in a moment more shocking than you might think movies can be any more . norton is perhaps at his most brilliant in this sequence ; his raised eyebrows of triumph as he is being arrested may be the most memorable single moment of screen acting this year . it's hard to imagine american history x ever getting made without the redemption/salvation angle , but it would have been much stronger without it . even more unnecessary is the contrived device in which danny is forced to write a history paper on derek's road to ruin , leading to a resolution that feels disappointingly pat . there's a grand sense of shakesepearean tragedy to the conclusion , but not nearly the intensity of emotion present as we're pulled into derek's racist world . we get that racism is bad . american history x works because it risks showing us why some people believe it's good . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1642,"director : brian helgeland . lots of action films go the anti-hero route , offering protagonists with single-sentence motivations who kill at least as many people as the ostensible villains of the piece . the assumption is that we'll be on the side of the star because . . . well , it doesn't matter how nasty or brutal arnold schwarzenegger or steven seagal get -- if they're the first name on the marquee , they're the ones whose gunplay and fisticuffs are cheered . mel gibson is a different case entirely . there has always been something genuinely unstable behind his eyes when he wants there to be -- mad max , the original lethal weapon , conspiracy theory -- but also something genuinely wounded that makes his instability as sympathetic as it is menacing . along the way to his goal , porter encounters plenty of intriguing characters , which is half the fun of payback . payback works in large part because it's not just mel gibson running around shooting and getting shot at . the whole atmosphere of the film is bleak and corrupt , from ericson core's bleached cinematography to the cold brick of richard hoover's production design . though it comes with a dose of humor , it's usually humor of the black variety , and the film rarely strays far from pulp crime thriller territory . there's violence , and then there's _violence_ , and then there's payback , which never shies away from the roughest rough stuff from the opening scene of un-anesthetized surgery . where a slap might suffice , a pistol-whipping shows up instead ; where you might expect a good old-fashioned roughing up , you can count on the strategic application of a sledgehammer . porter's world is certainly a brutal one , and porter himself is a brutal guy , but after a while it all starts to feel like overkill . you reach the point where you don't need to see val beat up a woman and shoot a dog to figure out that he's not too nice a guy . fortunately , it all comes back to gibson , whose monomania about his $70 , 000 makes just enough sense to keep the plot moving . there's a bit too much effort directed towards making porter seem sensitive through his relationship with a high-priced call girl ( maria bello ) -- apparently the result of gibson's initial dissatisfaction with director and co-writer brian helgeland's relentlessly dark tone -- but it all seems like unnecessary effort . payback only works as entertainment because gibson himself conveys all the reason we need to get behind porter . if you can get past all the bloodshed and brutality , you'll find a surprisingly slick and surprisingly smart action thriller in payback . the amazing thing is that , by all rights , you _shouldn't_ be able to get past it . credit gibson for giving us the kind psycho you can't help cuddling up to . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1643,"screenplay : joao emanuel carneiro and marcos bernstein . director : walter salles . some day soon , i'm going to put together a list of the most over-used premises in film history , the ones which describe the entire story arc in a single sentence . to be fair , and to recognize that certain plots become canonical for valid thematic reasons , i'll even try to note examples of each that managed to add a spark of originality . such stories usually begin with characters that are crusty but identifiably loveable , making the journey little more than a waiting game until the resident adorable tyke trims off the crust . dora , on the other hand , is a fairly grim piece of work . fernanda montenegro uses her wonderfully weathered face to create dora as a grandmotherly con artist , and not the kind of devilishly adorable con artist justified in most films by the fact that he or she steals robin hood-like from the rich . it's eventually obvious that central station is about dora's quest for her own father more than it is about her quest for josue's father , but that's exactly what gives the familiar story more thematic weight . the cute bonding moments between dora and josue are few and far between , allowing director walter salles to concentrate on the fact that the journey changes dora more than the child does . for most of the film , her anti-social personality feels completely genuine , not in the least like a device for an uplifting conclusion . inevitably , though , central station has got to reach its uplifting conclusion . and it is only when that happens that central station feels false , even though the change is necessary in order for it to be dramatically satisfying . montenegro is a deft enough actress to limit the burden of schmaltz , but she can't change the fact that the script tells her that , by god , she's going to learn important lessons . central station is still a good film , satisfying for three-quarters of its length as a character study . there's just no way it can escape completely the conventions of its single-sentence story . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1644,"director : joe johnston . mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 108 minutes . october sky is a tough sort of film to get people to look at clearly . touted in its marketing campaign as "" inspirational "" and "" triumphant "" -- usually code words for "" sentimental "" and "" heavy-handed "" -- it could easily lead more cynical movie-goers to dismiss it sight unseen as mawkish foolishness . others , of a more feel-good nature , will think they have seen a great film simply because , well , it makes them feel good . it's hard for both potential sets of viewers to get a handle on why october sky works -- it avoids most of the traps the former group fears , while delivering the satisfying emotional resonance the latter group desires . this , of course , is the cue to begin your typical triumph of the spirit , winning-against-the-odds , kids-wiser-than-their parents crowd-pleaser . in some ways , the elements in october sky are quite typical : a determined young hero , societal obstacles , a big climax at a competitive event . yet there are enough ways october sky is _not_ typical to make it surprisingly effective . director joe johnston , best known for special effects-driven films like jumanji and the rocketeer , lends energy and humor to the montage of failed initial attempts at rocket flight . the production creates a complete , convincing picture of its small-town world , treating its characters with a clear-eyed realization that they're neither simple hicks nor salt-of-the-earth country folk . and there's something fundamentally , unconventionally appealing about a film where teenagers are obsessed with an intellectual pursuit , a film where the protagonist proves his innocence of a suspected crime by using a mathematical formula . it is also unconventionally appealing to see a father-son relationship treated with such sensitivity and intelligence . certainly it helps that an actor as subtly gifted as chris cooper is playing john hickam . too many actors would have made him a gruff thick-head who converts to understanding just in time for a big hug ; cooper makes john's stubbornness both caring and slightly dismissive of a boy acting smarter than his own pa . jake gyllenhaal is equally enjoyable as homer , making his fascination with rocket science an expression of his desire to explore the universe beyond coalwood . the interactions between john and homer form october sky's emotional backbone , and nearly every one of them is pitched at a level of conflict which seems honest rather than movie-conflict shrill . there are a number of occasions when october sky does begin to feel like its more convention-bound cousins . there is an obligatory romantic sub-plot for homer which appears and disappears so quickly that there hardly seems to be a point ; an illness experienced by homer's favorite teacher ( laura dern ) , while historically accurate , further bogs down the narrative . the last half-hour of october sky is not nearly as well-paced as the first hour , dragging out homer's journey to the national science fair , but that doesn't detract from the film's many pleasures . october sky is inspirational , and it is triumphant ; it's also smart , well-written , and well-acted . this one shows that feel-good movies don't also have to be feel-dumb movies . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1645,"screenplay : guy ritchie . director : guy ritchie . it's tough to knock a film as undeniably invigorating as lock , stock and two smoking barrels without coming off as an impossible-to-please crank . yes , it's generally funny , clever and unpredictable ; true , it's plotted with a precision that should make aspiring screenwriters take notes ; indeed , it has visual style to spare . guy ritchie's caper/comedy/thriller has a savage entertainment value that's awfully hard to find anymore . it's also a film without an ounce of humanity , a narrative machine where the fun feels hollow because the characters come with names and virtually nothing more . that's a problem that really only nags in hindsight , since you'll spend all your viewing time just trying to keep up . believe it or not , that's the simple part of the multi-layered plotting in lock , stock and two smoking barrels . there are plenty of occasions during the first half of the film when it feels over-populated , over-plotted and over-directed , sending situations , vertiginous camera angles and new faces at the audience in overwhelming waves . only ritchie's appealing wit might keep you from throwing up your hands and throwing in the towel . fortunately , the second and third acts offer so much propulsive action that forgiveness for the early excesses becomes fairly easy . ritchie manages to pull all these threads together quite deftly , creating a series of confrontations which continuously whip up new permutations of violence , dark humor and surprise . there are missteps here as well -- including a depiction of the protagonists' celebrating an apparent victory which resembles a drinking binge by the monkees -- but the caper itself is engrossing enough to help hide them . lock , stock and two smoking barrels blindsides you with its sheer momentum , the pieces falling into place so rapidly that you can't help but admire ritchie's audacity . it's considerably harder to admire his thoroughgoing lack of interest in his characters except as gun-toting props . every bit of color in the film's performances comes from the use of physical types -- the bald , imposing barry ; the short , high-strung rory ; strapping but soft-spoken big chris . quentin tarantino often is credited with inspiring a slew of nihilistic comic-crime imitators , but tarantino's way with actors and redemption-hungry characters has always given him away as a closet humanist , and has always tempered his infamous violent streak . you can't knock a director in 1999 who at least makes you want to watch . you just wish this rowdy bit of entertainment made you want to care about something , anything , besides how many bodies will pile up before the credits roll . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1647,"screenplay : ken scarborough , based on characters created by jim jinkins . director : maurice joyce . mpaa rating : g . running time : 77 minutes . there are two basic kinds of "" family films "" that come to your local multiplex . in one category are those that genuinely deserve the name "" family film , "" the kind that can actually keep an adult entertained while remaining appropriate for kids . in the other category are the generally inspid , generally tv-based tales made exclusively for non-discriminating sub-teens . with no experience of the television series on which it was based , i went into doug's 1st movie expecting the latter . instead , i found something halfway between the two : a good-natured , good-humored kids' film that actually treated young viewers as though they had intelligence . the plot for doug's 1st movie returns to some recurring threads from the "" doug "" show which originated on nickelodeon before moving to abc saturday mornings . should he risk derision by helping herman and taking on mr . bluff , or focus on staying in patti's good graces ? in fact , it's not really much of a dilemma at all . doug is the nicest of nice guys , an easy guy for his peers to relate to . like most adolescents , he's a little insecure , but he always tries hard to do the right thing . that's the basic , simple appeal of doug's 1st movie : it's a message movie for kids in which the message is "" be decent , "" and where the message isn't obscured by special effects or infantilism . sure , it moves at a fairly pokey cartoon pace , but that's a welcome respite from animated films that behave as though kids will only sit still for frantic action . parents may even be sitting still for some of the funny asides in doug's 1st movie . though ken scarborough's script is hardly heavy on adult references , it does feel slightly smarter than most cartoon scripts . i don't think a single line in the film would be over the head of a 12-year-old , yet somehow i still felt in on the joke despite the fact that most of the humor centered on schoolkid types ( the whiz-kid nerds , the stuck-up rich girl , the minor-league bully and his cronies ) . the best point of comparison for doug's 1st movie is probably the "" peanuts "" television specials and features of the late 60s and 1970s -- they were both sincere and engaging , and easy for families to share . doug may not stand "" peanuts' "" test of time , but it's a solid choice for parents who like the idea of a film that doesn't condescend to their kids . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1648,"our collective existential/millennial/y2k-bug angst now has been channelled officially into one cinematic premise : the line between reality and virtual reality is growing too thin for comfort , and cyberspace is intruding on our personal space . though the marketing campaign ( and official web site ) teases us with the cryptic question "" what is the matrix ? "" , it wouldn't be giving anything away to say that it's something you'll be seeing a lot of over the next few months . we'll all be fortunate if what we see is as kinetically entertaining as the matrix . if that description seems a bit coy , it's only because part of the fun in the first half of the matrix is allowing its bizarre cosmology to unfold . though there's plenty of exposition required to explain what's going on in the matrix , the wachowskis manage to do it with a wink and a smile , investing the expository segments with wit and imagination . the film's first hour is somewhat slow going , yet even while waiting for it to gain momentum there's a certain confidence that it will . and boy , does it ever . the action sequences in the matrix are some of the best in a long time , combining wicked visual effects ( familiar to those who've seen any gap commercials lately ) with creative choreography . fully aware that they're dealing physics of their own invention , the wachowskis let loose with both barrels , sending the matrix over-the-top and into the realm of video game excess . amazingly , it almost never feels like a video-game movie , thanks mostly to the wachowskis' sure-handed pacing but also to some ingenious casting . the matrix is a blast , but it's never a dumb blast . there are plenty of places where it feels like the matrix could have been tidied up a bit -- a lengthy chase here , a pointless romantic angle there , a conversation about why everything tastes like chicken over there -- to bring the running time down below two hours . it's the kind of movie that will turn off plenty of viewers , either because of its violence , its convoluted story or its pokiness in getting to the good stuff . others will see the matrix as the kind of film that makes use of action and special effects instead of being used by them , the kind of film that takes that extra moment to turn its big showdown into a classic spaghetti western confrontation . if virtual reality is the flavor of the month , plug me in to something like the matrix , and give me a world where the adventure is worth two hours of my time . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1649,"producers : leslie urdang and michael hoffman . director : michael hoffman . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , brief nudity ) running time : 115 minutes . the cinematic cynic in me suspects that the lofty , unwieldy title of william shakespeare's a midsummer night's dream has as much to do with timely marketing as it does with a nod to literary fidelity . after all , when adults are flocking to the oscar-winning shakespeare in love and teens are catching "" the taming of the shrew "" turned into 10 things i hate about you , the bard would seem to be riding a unique wave of cross-demographic hipness . to that extent , this midsummer night is truly william shakespeare's in its mix of disparate elements , with all the delights and potential pitfalls that accompany them . at its most basic level , a midsummer night's dream is a precursor to bedroom farce without the slamming doors ( doors being hard to come by in the forest ) . as the enchanted lovers become a circle of frustration -- lysander is made to love helena , who still loves demetrius , who still loves hermia , who still loves lysander -- saucy exchanges alternate with good old-fashioned female mud wrestling . it takes more than a little while for the film to find its pacing , hindered by the atypically awkward work of strathairn , but once the pleasantly low-tech , stage-set world of the forest becomes the focus , the high and low comedy both begin working . it's an interesting interpretation , but one that doesn't always mesh with the other players . the other major sub-plot becomes both a midsummer night dream's high point and its source of greatest disappointment . unfortunately , hoffman doesn't exploit kline's performance for all it can offer , never really delivering a satisfying resolution to the character he has set up . the bumbling performance is pure slapstick -- malapropped lines , misaligned props , over-the-top acting and , to quote shakespeare in love , a bit with a dog . it's a sweet note on which to end a play of sometimes discordant tones , perhaps making this dream seem less uneven that it should . the course of this tale about the course of true love never does run smooth ; it merely offers a fanciful comedy deserving enough of the author's name . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1650,"perspective is a curious matter . sometimes , a thing is entirely how you look at it rather than the thing itself . even in the mind , style can triumph over substance . there is an abundance of style on display in three seasons , enough to cloak its lapses in substance . the narrative consists of four largely independent stories of life in modern saigon . visually , three seasons is a remarkably assured piece of film-making , using the contrasts of ancient , war-time and modern vietnam to perfection . cinematographer lisa rinzler captures flower-showered streets and lotus gardens with a warm glow , helping make three seasons an often enchanting tone poem on the conflicts inherent in introducing the contemporary into the conventional . as a narrative , it's considerably more inconsistent , as one might expect from the multiple independent story-lines . by far the most effective is the tale of cyclo driver hai , given the strongest emotional and thematic pull by don duong's exceptional performance . at its core his is a tried-and-true hooker with a heart of gold story , yet something in duong's manner makes the cliche more resonant , his attempts to "" save "" lan more ennobling than predictable . each of the other tales has its moments , but they come more sporadically . keitel's american perspective feels particularly intrusive , almost like a sop to american audiences ; what's more , it adds a title-confounding fourth story to the three seasons . though three seasons rarely inspires seat-shifting , it's never as engaging as it is when the focus is on hai . still , the stories do ultimately come together as tales of healing , of reconciling vietnam's troubled past with its challenging present and future . as the first american production shot in vietnam since the war , it's also an often-compelling cultural document . there's little doubt that three seasons feels somehow more "" significant "" because it is so gracefully and beautifully composed , but that's hardly a cause for consternation . if it pushes plenty of the right aesthetic buttons , that only proves that glamour can change one's perspective , as it clearly has in a post-war saigon where coke adds life . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1651,"tom tykwer's run lola run is pure cinema at its most maddening and invigorating . few films this year will leave viewers as charged from experiencing the film medium in the hands of someone who knows how to use it ; few films this year pack so much reckless energy into a tight 81 minutes . and few films this year not directed by george lucas will put more effort into telling a tale about people who don't really matter as characters . run lola run is a giddy exercise in overkill combining splendid bursts of audacity with a largely "" who cares "" narrative . if manni and money are not at the designated pickup spot at noon sharp the same day , manni is almost certainly a dead man . the crux of tykwer's premise is showing us three alternate fates for lola and manni based on those caprices of chance . it's a gimmick that allows him to turn a short film into a feature , but it works better than you have any reason to expect . each segment comes with at least one surprising twist , the kind of detail that shows tykwer's rare talent for being ingenious without being self-congratulatory about his ingenuity . the most surprising twist of all may be the welcome flippancy in his gloss on the usually heavy topics of fate and chance . his best-executed running gag involves staccato , freeze-frame asides in each segment showing how lola's encounters with complete strangers -- changed by a matter of seconds in each variation -- change those peripheral lives as well . tykwer uses his marginalia better than many filmmakers use the entire page . often , however , it's all just a bit . . . much . the collisons of animation , video , still images and film seem to exist as much because they can as for any practical reason ; surrealist touches like lola's ability to shatter glass with a scream are more befuddling distraction than artistic nuance . all the busy-ness of tykwer's business does an effective job of distracting from just how emotionally weightless it all is . the quiet interpersonal moments between lola and manni , inserted between the alternate reality segments , should have been striking for the insight they provide . instead , they're striking because they're about the only chance you have to catch your breath . still , it's hard to resist a film that maintains such a relentless pace and squeezes so much pleasure from such a simple concept . it's also hard to resist the charisma of franka potente , the wild-eyed star whose furiously pumping legs fuel run lola run . if there had been the hint of a person behind that personality , run lola run could have been sheer brilliance . even without that strong human story , it's still the sort of action-packed crowd-pleaser that makes so many blockbusters look so sadly bloated . the sheer momentum of tykwer's techno-pop-pulsing direction makes the film an entertaining jolt to the system , even if it's all ultimately auteurist eye candy . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1652,"screenplay : tab murphy and bob tzudiker & noni white , based on the novel _tarzan of the apes_ by edgar rice burroughs . directors : kevin lima and chris buck . mpaa rating : g ( adult themes ) running time : 85 minutes . the opening ten minutes of disney's tarzan represent as gripping and mature an example of animated film-making as i've ever seen . that dark , dazzling prologue works not only on its own dramatic terms , but also at shifting expectations -- perhaps tarzan could stand on its own as more than re-cycled motifs from the jungle book and the lion king . tarzan continues disney's impressive streak in recent years of incorporating more serious themes into its animated features . there are moments when it's easy to forget you're watching a film marketed at kids , from the effective interpersonal moments ( energized by driver's charming vocal performance ) to the twist on the obligatory musical numbers that turns most of them into transitional bridges . the animation itself feels more grown-up , even when the flashy "" deep canvas "" technology turns a trek through the trees into a ready-made theme park ride . where its animated features are concerned -- and its live-action kid flicks , notoriously , are not -- it's clear disney genuinely cares about creating complete , resonant stories . it's also clear that disney cares plenty about making sure the cash cow isn't cut just for the prime rib audience . there are kids' club burgers to be sold as well , which means comic relief that's a relief only when it goes away . both characters , plush-toy cute though they may be , feel like tacked-on creations contributing a slapstick silliness the story just doesn't need ; the pointless show-stopper "" trashin' the camp "" in particular seems to belong in another film entierly . even the nasty clayton is out of place , adding an external conflict only because tradition has dictated it . there's nothing wrong with disney making purely amusing kiddie fare like hercules and aladdin . there's also nothing wrong with letting the deeper stories be deep . the issue isn't whether tarzan should have been plodding and somber , because it's clear that the core narrative could provide all the entertainment a viewer of any age could want . there's plenty of humor in the interactions between tarzan and jane , and plenty of adventure in tarzan's various encounters with jungle beasts . tarzan is a solid film , stronger in its basic filmmaking elements than most wide-release films , but it might have been a spectacular one instead . disney will never go broke relying on the successful disney animated formula , and they'll continue to turn out largely enjoyable family films . they'll also have trouble breaking free to make a stirring , utterly unique animated film , one that fulfills the potential of tarzan's magnificent first ten minutes . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1653,"screenplay : david mamet , based on the play by terence rattigan . director : david mamet . mpaa rating : g running time : 100 minutes . depending upon one's point of view , the winslow boy is either as unlikely a piece of material as one could expect from david mamet or a perfect fit in the mamet oeuvre . certainly it's surprising to find mamet directing a script by another writer , even more surprising to find the ultra-contemporary mamet directing a period piece , and more surprising yet to find the profanity-happy mamet directing a g-rated script . there's also something perfectly mamet-like in the film's themes of people seeking the truth of things behind the formalized dance of conversation . mamet isn't straying far from comfortable ground , but he strays far enough to find an intriguing new perspective on film-making . the winslow boy may be his finest work as a film director , perhaps because he's working from a less tightly-controlled script . a contemporary movie-goer might expect the winslow boy to turn into a courtroom drama , chock full of witness stand backpedaling and banging gavels . rattigan's text is more concerned with subtler matters than the melodrama of legal confrontations , including issues still resonant fifty years after the play's debut . the story also attacks the casual dismissal of pursuits of justice , not on the basis of right or wrong , but on the basis of how annoying it is to have normalcy disrupted . as thought-provoking as the winslow boy may be , however , it's often far too sedate in its interpersonal relationships . the characters in the winslow boy face consequences for their choices , but the choices are more interesting to rattigan than those consequences . there's a merchant ivory vibe to the repressed emotions without the merchant ivory readiness to show the intensity behind them . mamet has never been known for his emotionalism , but the fault here appears to lie far more with rattigan . indeed , mamet takes some of the simplest scenes and charges them with more feeling than they might deserve ( notably arthur's demand of honesty from ronnie ) . he has always been a remarkably efficient film director , and the winslow boy certainly doesn't stray in that regard . hawthorne is brilliant , northam is appropriately enigmatic , and even rebecca pidgeon seems vaguely human . there's little mamet can do with the huge chunks of dialogue involving exposition of off-stage events , or to fill in the spaces between the people , but he does a lot with a story that's more conceptual than actual . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1654,"screenplay : trey parker & matt stone and pam brady . director : trey parker . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , adult humor , cartoon violence , sexual situations ) running time : 81 minutes . south park : bigger , longer & uncut is crude and profane . it's more-than-occasionally offensive . it's naughty just to see how much naughtiness you can get away with . it's repetitious in its dependence on obscenity from the mouths of babes . this is about as vile and inexcusable as comedy film-making gets , a distillation of everything people fear popular culture is doing to our sensibilities , and i laughed so hard i thought i'd harm an internal organ . there's no question that "" south park "" is for a very specific taste , or lack thereof . even those who had been embracing the series now seem to have tired of trey parker and matt stone's crass market approach to grabbing laughs , as evidenced by the show's plummeting ratings . bigger , longer & uncut's missed jokes and sniggering immaturity probably wouldn't surprise even the staunchest "" south park "" fan ; its sporadic brilliance may surprise everyone . the premise is a reflexive commentary on "" harmful "" film-making , with the show's four young pals -- eric cartman ( parker ) , stan marsh ( parker ) , kyle broflovski ( stone ) and kenny mccormick ( stone ) -- learning some interesting words from an r-rated feature film starring scatalogical cartoon stars terrance & phillip . the children's profane outbursts cause a parental panic in which terrance & phillip's home nation of canada is held accountable for many societal ills . the broad pot-shots at censorship and moralistic hysteria aren't surprising coming from parker and stone , who have been heralded as harbingers of the apocalypse themselves . they get in a few swipes at the mpaa ( which branded parker's orgazmo with an nc-17 ) , taking particular aim at the greater concern with vulgarity than with violence . the target may be easy and some of the jokes obvious , but parker and stone keep the chuckles coming at the expense of those who would condemn them . as it turns out , the film is far less effective as social satire than it is at pop culture parody . you see , bigger , longer & uncut is a musical , with many of the numbers by parker and composer marc shaiman patterned after the recent disney formula . parker and stone then switch gears to target les miserables , as the children's "" la resistance "" movement opposing their parents' proposed execution of terrance & phillip generates numbers keyed to "" one day more "" and "" a little fall of rain . "" the fifteen songs provide the film's most riotous moments , including terrance & phillip's explosively obscene ode to molestation and satan's tender ballad about his quest for happiness . you may never feel guiltier about laughing harder . a style like parker and stone's , similar to scattershot predecessors like mel brooks and the zucker-abrahams-zucker team , is bound to produce its share of duds like the go-nowhere jabs at a perpetually horny saddam hussein . many viewers will just be turned off by the use of homosexuality or military racism as punch lines , or even the whole idea of easily-influenced kids in today's charged post-columbine high climate . south park : bigger , longer & uncut isn't going to make anyone prouder to be an american , or any less convinced that movies are all about shock value . it's not even going to earn points for preaching to the choir about letting parents do the job of parenting . it may do nothing more than leave you choking back the laughs for fear of acknowledging the power of your inner 12-year-old . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1655,"you have to know what you can expect from writer david e . kelley -- and what you _can't_ expect -- to have a chance of enjoying the determinedly quirky lake placid . he delights in creating eccentric characters , giving them outrageous things to say , and hoping that our amusement and affection for those characters will carry us through stories where his main goal is making a social statement . this isn't a master of plotting we're talking about here . if you can swing with kelley's off-beat sense of humor , you're in good shape ; if not , you're in for a long night of eye-rolling and teeth-grinding . for lake placid , his first thriller , kelley abandons the social commentary entirely to give his goofy characters plenty of room to work , in a genre where plotting isn't particularly vital . the result is an occasionally hilarious insult comedy only occasionally interrupted by a monster movie . the combination of tightly-wound urbanites and laconic locals provides most of the comic fodder in lake placid . when it works , it works wonderfully , particularly when platt and gleeson square off . platt always shines when given the role of the big-mouth , making him an ideal actor for kelley's tart zingers . gleeson , meanwhile , lends keough a restraint and dignity you wouldn't expect from a character who's a skeet for put-downs . movie-goers who can enjoy a film simply by revelling in quotable lines , including a sly shot at woody allen's infamous "" the heart wants what the heart wants "" comment , are in for a real treat those expecting something akin to an actual thriller , on the other hand , are in for a disappointment . the first hour of lake placid includes a couple of graphic dismemberments and a few animal carcases , but not much else in the way of scares . in fact , the entire premise generally seems like an excuse to put these four characters in the same place and let them snipe at each other . and as clever as kelley's writing can be , it's distracting when he calls attention to his own cleverness ( a notion to which any number of "" ally mcbeal "" detractors can attest ) , or grows infatuated with the lack of restrictions on an r-rated film's dialogue . lake placid is basically a one-type-of-joke film . how quickly one tires of that one type of joke will go a long way towards determining one's enjoyment . fortunately , kelley and director steve miner don't give that joke much chance to grow tired , wrapping up the proceedings in a tidy 80 minutes . that includes a corker of a conclusion , with more tension and narrow escapes in five minutes than in the rest of the film combined . the climax is almost enough to fool you into thinking lake placid was actually a thriller , instead of a farcical comedy with expensive mechanical reptiles . kelley has already proven himself a writer for very specific tastes , and lake placid isn't a tremendous stretch in his oeuvre . it is , however , very funny when it's supposed to be . you just have to be prepared for something unconventionally effective when the creator of "" ally mcbeal "" does jaws . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1656,"after flaming out spectacularly in its last few attempts at feature animation -- gems like quest for camelot and the king and i -- warner bros . finally figured out how to guarantee a decent story : they re-made e . t . as a cartoon . technically , of course , that's not what the iron man is . on a fairly superficial level , the iron man is a cold war allegory about paranoia turned against anything unfamiliar . screenwriter tim mccanlies and director brad bird drop in little tidbits of period detail -- hogarth's fascination with radiation/mutation films , his friendship with a beatnik scrapyard owner/artist ( harry connick jr . ) -- but they don't really take full advantage of their setting . the decision to set the film in 1957 maine seems fairly arbitrary , especially since hughes' book was not . a bit more successful is the thematic treatment of the giant as a weapon that learns how to be human . some viewers may shift in their seats at the "" guns kill "" message-mongering , but it's intriguing to see a family film tackling the notion of a sentient being accepting responsibility for its own moral choices , and finding heroism in the process . the iron giant ultimately does prove entertaining not because of its astute observations about 1950s america or gun control , but because it's a classic "" boy and his dog "" story -- e . t . the set-ups are familiar , but familiarity doesn't have to mean laziness . as directed by "" the simpsons "" and "" king of the hill "" veteran bird , the iron giant has a slightly subversive sense of humor and a lively pace , giving the oft-told tale its own unique spice . it's e . t . -lite , to be sure , but it still pushes the right buttons . on a technical level , the iron giant may not dazzle like some recent disney features . while the integration of the digitally-created giant and the conventionally-drawn characters is seamless , the backgrounds come out a bit flat and the colors somewhat muted . yet the toned-down animation may actually work to the iron giant's advantage . there's more innocence to the character design , more simple charm in the laid-back direction . i'm not sure the iron giant earns the big emotional crescendo it's looking for when hogarth finally stares skyward at the giant and says "" i love you , "" but the fundamental appeal of the relationship between a lonely boy and his alien puppy is always in effect . if it's true that there are no new stories to tell , the success of a film is always about the time the filmmakers invest in telling the old stories well . so e . t . you'll still probably be pulling for him to turn on his heartlight . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1657,"movie people love making movies about movie people -- they validate film-making as the most fascinating of all pursuits , even as they allow tinseltown to tweak its own inflated image . it's a wonderful mystery of the film industry that so much self-absorption and self-loathing can co-exist without some sort of matter/anti-matter explosion . too often , though , the tweak doesn't take . steven seagal playing himself in my giant was unconvincing as a pompous , difficult star playing a pompous , difficult star ; burn hollywood burn was as brainless and misguided as the films it intended to satirize . for every the player , there are half a dozen attempts at insider humor too self-congratulatory to tap into what's truly goofy about hollywood . ramsey has no interest in the project , but bowfinger has a creative solution . little does bowfinger know that the strange things happening around kit are sending the already-edgy celebrity into a full-fledged paranoia . the key is that he knows how to do it with affection , finding the absurdity in film culture and conventions while still recognizing their magical appeal . in a sense , bowfinger is a broad , contemporary re-working of ed wood , the story of a guy so determined to make his mark that he'll go to bizarre lengths to do it . martin the actor lets go of his recent flustered everyman persona to find a guy willing to look ridiculous to be a player . the scattershot approach to hollywood satire should have fallen flat , and on occasion it does feel somewhat forced . director frank oz certainly deserves some credit for his deft touch , but the real anchor of bowfinger is eddie murphy . unlike seagal , murphy appears genuinely willing to poke fun at his history as holy terror . it's a wild , wired performance , complemented by his second role as jiff , the geeky kit ramsey look-alike bowfinger hires as a stand-in . jiff not only lets murphy subtly satirize his fondness for playing multiple roles ; he provides a sympathetic face for an innocent's sense of wonder at the world of the movies . murphy should always be this loose and entertaining . bowfinger isn't a perfect comedy , at times pushing its thin premise farther than it can sustain . heather graham's secretly machiavellian ingenue grows a bit tiresome , and the mindhead gags often feel timid and blunted . when the set pieces work , however -- jiff's terrified journey across a freeway , or an attempt to spook kit in a parking garage , or gathering a "" crew "" at the mexican border -- they're wonderfully funny stuff . it's also a movie about movies that doesn't get caught up in its own hipness . when steve martin wants you to laugh at something about hollywood , you know it's out of authentic whimsy , not a movie star's hypocritical attempt to cozy up to the laypeople . as a result , bowfinger feels relaxed and honest , a satire with enough wisdom to recognize there's still something delightful about being a film-maker . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1658,"screenplay : hirokazu koreeda . producers : masayuki akieda and shiho sato . director : hirokazu koreeda . mpaa rating : unrated ( adult themes ) running time : 118 minutes . hirokazu koreeda's after life is a film that stirs the imagination instantly -- which is fortunate , because the overflow of good will has to carry through an ill-conceived conclusion . the provocative premise combines the post-mortem bureaucracy of defending your life with a conversation from city slickers about the best days of one's life . the memories about which they speak are intriguing enough in their own right -- some with tales about childhood innocence , others with accounts of adult adventures -- to spark reflections by viewers about their own favored recollections . more intriguing still is after life's exploration of the nature of memory as a combination of things as they were and things as we wish they could have been . even the conceit of creating a film version of an imperfect memory -- rather than using the archived videotapes of people's lives available to the case workers -- emphasizes the power of filtered , romanticized remembrance . for over an hour , after life delights with reflections on what we remember and how we remember it , letting the steady stream of interviews flow over the loose narrative structure . in the course of helping watanabe -- who considers his life so mundane that there's not a moment worth remembering -- mochizuki struggles with unresolved issues from his own life . after spending most of the film as effective supporting players , the rosencrantzes and guildensterns of after life cold-cock this "" hamlet "" and make it all about them . there's nothing inherently wrong with a movie about the longings of otherworldly guides , unless you count the fact that it's already been done a few times . but after life shouldn't have been one of those movies , since it already had so much going for it as meditation on transcendent life experiences . there's a strange appeal to the production's heaven-as-low-budget-independent-film-set look , and plenty more appeal to the tales of the deceased . it's hard not to suspect that after life would have made an extraordinary documentary , since koreeda's steady , concentrated medium shots of the characters describing their memories are so effective . maybe then koreeda wouldn't have been tempted to leave the strengths of his film -- which are plenty strong -- for the supernatural melodrama of long-lost loves . in my memory , this one will linger as a good film that could have been great . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1659,"producers : armyan bernstein and amy robinson . director : sam raimi mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , brief gore ) running time : 138 minutes . arguably his two strongest performances -- in two of his strongest films -- have come when he was dealing with baseball : bull durham , and field of dreams . there's something about costner , some combination of his convincingly athletic build and his aw-shucks , laconic manner that makes him well-suited to tales of our peculiarly mythologized national pastime . it's only natural that he'd want to return to the diamond for a film like for love of the game . could he maintain his perfect batting average , even playing a non-hitting american league pitcher ? the short answer is yes , though it's more of a solid single than field of dreams' ground-rule double or bull durham's inside-the-park home run . for love of the game is deftly constructed as perhaps the ideal date movie -- it's a love story that also happens to be a baseball movie . though costner is plenty agreeable in his easy-going way , it's preston who really sells the romantic side of the story . the chemistry between preston and costner is solid , but there's a nagging sense that there's much more to know about billy . the absence of any previous romantic history for billy robs the love story of context ; it's hard to see the person he was , so we can feel for the person he needs to become . some of that context is provided by the baseball sequences , which are satisfying in their own right . though there are a couple of technical blunders -- a scoreboard that shows no hits for both teams shortly before the announcer says the tigers have two hits -- the game sequences do their job as character development . still , it's sometimes difficult to lock into the fate of billy and jane's relationship , not because of the distractions of the game sequences , but because billy remains so enigmatic . in another sense , that mystery could simply be a distraction from a viewer's confidence that these two people actually belong together . make no mistake , for love of the game is fundamentally satisfying -- it can't help but be with _two_ big payoff scenes -- and well-acted . director sam raimi delivers the crowd-pleasing goods , and the film delivers more laughs than you might expect . i only wish billy chapel had been more of a complete character , and less one of those baseball icons costner has exploited so successfully in other films . it just could have been better . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1660,"like cats and dogs , guinevere is a tale of a young woman's self-realization through photography ; also like cats and dogs , and much to its advantage , it's a story elevated by a radiant lead performance . it's almost too easy to use the film's title for emphasis , but it's also true : in a film that runs out of gas before it runs out of time , sarah polley shines like cinema royalty , making it far easier to overlook guinevere's tactical errors . there's no question that polley -- who dazzled in the sweet hereafter and stole the multi-character go -- is turning into one of the most gifted actresses of her generation . like janeane garofolo in the truth about cats and dogs , she makes insecurity genuinely affecting instead of merely affected , doing things with her mouth and her eyes that make your heart want to break . there is a scene involving connie's first sexual advances that has been played in any number of films with a soft-focus earnestness ; polley giggles and shifts with nervous energy , finding the awkwardness at the heart of initial intimacies . she is ably complemented by rea -- who takes an alcoholic lecher and manages to make him as sympathetic as he is slimy -- and jean smart -- a caustic delight as harper's mother . the tone grows unnecessarily "" heavy , "" turning a frisky coming-of-age piece into one of those "" i was never the same after that summer stories . "" while it's bitterly funny watching mrs . sloane dissect connie's motives , it provides too simple an explanation for the complex dynamics of a potentially interesting relationship , and ultimately shifts the balance of the film away from harper and towards connie . though wells' guinevere has a lot going for it in the way of sharp dialogue and finely crafted character moments , the film-maker stumbles when she doesn't realize that the best thing she's got going is polley . in this bright young actress's capable hands , this story of lessons in love earns solid marks . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1661,"mpaa rating : unrated ( could be pg-13 for adult themes , profanity ) running time : 80 minutes . francis veber writes an interesting brand of farce . where most farce either soars or crashes , veber's occupies a little-seen middle ground : funny enough that people like it , but not so spectacular that it intimidates hollywood's remake-happy execs . "" we can do this even better , "" they quite reasonably say to themselves . the simple talent for being just entertaining enough suddenly doesn't seem quite so simple . set almost entirely in brochant's flat , the dinner game certainly feels like the stage play adaptation it is . occasionally , that means the film feels claustrophobic , with people waiting for phones to ring or doors to open . veber can be something of a minimalist farceur , his direction taking the blake edwards route of getting out of the way of comic situations rather than trying to contribute much to them visually . his best trick is cutting to stone-faced reaction takes by lhermitte and francis huster ( as brochant's pal ) , and his pacing isn't exactly spectacular , especially in an 80 minute film . by no means is this a film-maker without his flaws . there are punch lines in the dinner game that should be obvious from the moment they're a speck in the distance , yet somehow they still manage to zing . villeret's pignon is an exaggerated creation , to be sure , but his bizarre goofs are made endearing by his obvious desire to be liked ; he's like a great dane who wags his tail so hard he knocks over everything around him . the dinner game generates some big-time laughs , and does generate momentum towards its climax , when a visit by a tax auditor ( daniel prevost ) creates even more chaos . veber does predictably try to find a moral to the story , allowing brochant to learn a lesson about using cruelty as a spectator sport . it's a token effort , since neither veber nor lhermitte seem much interested in developing brochant as a character until the final five minutes . there are also a couple of jokes that just don't work in translation -- puns that feel too forced , and a put-on belgian accent that's only as riotous as your familiarity with belgian accents . still , the dinner game amuses and entertains persistently , if not consistently , mining its basic dolt-with-fuming-straight-man premise for all it's worth . that final point should be emphasized , since the internet movie database notes that veber is preparing his own english-language version of the dinner game . he should know by now that one moderately appealing comedy is generally all his farces are worth . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1662,"invites the tag line for american beauty , and rarely has a two-word advertising campaign so effectively captured virtually everything a film has to say . it's easy to understand much of the praise , since it captures you in its world virtually from the first frame . it's also a surprisingly simple film in which the notions that should be its subtext dominate its text . simultaneously gripping and frustrating , american beauty is the best film of the year that irritated the hell out of me . this , first and most important : kevin spacey is brilliant . that's not exactly news , since spacey has been brilliant on a regular basis for several years , but in american beauty he burns himself into an incredibly difficult role . there is a hyper-real feeling to much of the film -- a sense of people perceiving the world and people around them at an exaggerated , almost grotesque level -- yet spacey finds the ideal balance between lester the comic sadsack and lester the rejuvenated man . he grips alan ball's best lines of dialogue and spits them out like bullets , dominating the film so completely you may not realize how little screen time he actually has . the twisted , surreal vision of america provided by ball and director sam mendes -- even with its now-preditable assault on soul-deadening middle class life -- could have made for a masterpiece with a revelatory sensitbility at its core . instead , it's a very good film that makes a very rare mistake . where most films exist entirely at the surface level , american beauty exists entirely _below_ the surface , which is both tragic and ironic . it's easy to say that american beauty is about finding joy in the improbable places already around you instead of seeking unattainable ideals of joy , because the film makes this message excruciatingly clear in ricky's comments about his obsession with videotaping , as well as lester's narrative voice-overs . the ostensibly surprising moments in american beauty begin losing their power to surprise , since the film keeps telling you that things are not what they seem on the surface . it never allows a moment to let the surfaces just be surfaces , opting instead to spell out that real beauty is a wind-blown plastic bag . amazingly , american beauty still manages to be occasionally spell-binding , even as it stumbles through its literalism . mendes shows an impressive command of film language for a rookie with stage roots , using the talents of cinematographer conrad hall and composer thomas newman to create strong , always consistent vision . american beauty dazzles , it entertains , it shows off an actor at the top of his form . it just isn't nearly as enlightening as it seems to be , because it never asks the viewer to do too much work . as good as the film is , it isn't necessary for us to look closer . the film-makers have done all the looking for us . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1663,"screenplay : quentin tarrantino . what do you say about a movie when you thought it was filled with great scenes , but that they didn't add up to a great movie ? as one might expect from that pairing , this is no tea party ; it's a violent , high energy thrill ride filled with quirk characters usually engaged in shooting , getting shot at , beating the hell out of someone , or getting the hell beat out of them . the pacing is frantic , and the character interplay generally engaging . perhaps the problem is that when it's all over , i'm not quite sure whether there was a point beyond a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing . the first half-hour of true romance , focusing on clarence and alabama's whirlwind courtship , is perhaps its most coherent . the story is focused on two characters , and we have a chance to get to know something about them . as clarence , slater is cool and charismatic ; arquette is appealing in a sketchy role ( tarrantino seems to need some work writing women ) . from there , the story launches into a collection of vignettes , many of which pack a solid punch . bronson pinchot has some standout moments as a hollywood sycophant with a particularly weak stomach . scene after scene was either hilarious or gripping or both , but i felt distracted by the sheer number of supporting characters who appeared then disappeared all in a matter of minutes . it's an odd sort of compliment which becomes complaint : i didn't get enough of almost every character . the cast list is filled with "" names , "" but michael rapaport as clarence's struggling actor buddy has more screen time than most of them . much as it did for me in the player , though to a lesser degree , the star counting just got in the way . the story is fairly simple ; what makes the film stand out is tarrantino's marvelous ear for dialogue . there's not a cliche'd line to be found , and it makes the characters vibrant and alive . unfortunately , tony scott doesn't do the script the justice it deserves . i readily admit that i consider scott a hack as a director . with the intensity of tarrantino's material , a subtler touch is required . i give scott credit for a nifty roller-coaster sequence , but apart from that the monotony of the direction wore on me . i expected to hear "" take my breath away "" at any moment . when it comes right down to it , i was entertained by true romance . tarrantino knows how to deliver action and sharply drawn characters which keep the viewer engaged . i should also make special mention of hans zimmer's infectious calypso-tinged percussion score , which lent a heightened sense of the surreal . for me , however , this was a textbook case of the whole not equaling the sum of the parts . there was no real emotional linchpin , like mr . orange in reservoir dogs , to engage me beyond the purely visceral , and i can only care about a movie so far if i didn't care about any of the characters . like the roller-coaster in the film , true romance offers on philosophical truths , just a neck-snapping , gut churning white knuckler of a time . if that's what you're looking for , that's what you'll find .

1664,"miramax is marketing into the west as a "" family film , "" and while it's admirable to do so , i'm not sure it's the best idea . on the one hand , the deliberate pace appeared to lose the children in the audience when i saw the film . on the other , adults without children tend to stay away from "" family films , "" and that would be a shame . into the west is a charming , wise and gentle film that shows enough confidence to build slowly to a satisfying climax . i spent the first half hour or so of into the west a bit edgy and uninvolved , but it slowly began to occur to me that there might be an intentional reason . the scenes set in dublin are dark and claustrophobic , but as the action spreads into the irish countryside the film takes on a lyrical majesty . while into the west is not quite as successful overall , there is still a quiet grace to the visual narrative , thanks to cinematographer tom sigel's beautiful photography of hills and coastlines . the performances are not quite as engaging as the look of the film . gabriel byrne , as the dour and laconic papa , doesn't carry off his emotional scenes particularly well . ruaidhri conroy is sharp and good-natured as the protective older brother , if at times a bit affected . ciaran fitzgerald , however , is a scene-stealing charmer with great comic sensibility . the two are just right as brothers , and their scenes together are light and well-directed . if jim sheridan's script is a bit thin , it's because the story is secondary to the feel of the film . the villainous horse breeder and his police-officer henchman are perfunctory characters ; the story might have been done just as well without them . i also thought the portrayal of the travellers was underdeveloped , but i'll admit that's because i've studied celtic folklore and wanted to see more . still , i never really minded the lack of depth because the mystical tone seemed right on . i noted earlier that into the west was less successful as afilm for children , and that assessment comes simply from listening . if you've ever seen a movie with an audience comprised largely of children , you know that you get a minute-by-minute account of what they think about it . an older boy said simply , "" nothing's happening . "" while hardly a scientific test , these and other comment seemed to suggest that young ones without long attention spans might be less than enthralled . it's not a rollicking adventure , or a home alone-style comedy . however , for anyone with a taste for rich atmosphere spiced with a touch of magic might be pleasantly surprised .

1665,"steven soderbergh's the limey is sort of an action crime-drama -- only there's not all that much action , and relatively little crime . it's sort of a character study -- only there's not a whole lot of the main character to study . it's sort of an avant garde experiment by soderbergh -- only soderbergh has been plenty more avant garde in the past . the limey keeps nudging you for artistic respect , and you keep thinking you might give it more if only it would stop nudging . intriguing films don't often feel as minimally satisfying as the limey . on the surface , it seems like it has plenty going for it ( though surface is one of the main things it does have going for it ) . i suspect the limey would have felt like a 25-year-too-late episode of "" mannix "" if soderbergh hadn't jolted the film's visual style . in effect , he turns most of the film into an extension on his clooney/lopez seduction sequence in out of sight -- flashing forward , flashing back , laying dialogue from one scene over images from another . it might have come off as simple gimmickry , if it weren't such an effective method of getting inside wilson's head . an ex-con in unfamiliar territory and coping with unresolved grief , he's living the jagged , stream-of-consciousness life soderbergh shows us on the screen . that's a wonderful start for an exploration of how a criminal comes to terms with the choices he has made and the effect of those choices on those in his life . and that's about as far as it goes . for all its moodiness and somber tones , the limey really isn't terribly interested in the complexities of its characters . terence stamp does a nice job as wilson , mixing a bit of introspection into the standard issue tough guy , but the introspection isn't as deep as all the mournful close-ups of stamp would suggest -- he's just , as they say in the self-help biz , looking for closure . guzman and warren are flat-out wasted as supporting players who barely have a chance to register , while fonda gets one or two decent moments as the fading tycoon . and you have to credit katt , because screenwriter lem dobbs doesn't seem otherwise keen on vivid personalities . it's not that the limey isn't an enjoyable piece of work . soderbergh is one of those directors who can give a mundane scene an electrifying twist , as in the unconventional way he films wilson's rampage at a downtown warehouse . the reason the limey never feels like a gritty vengeance caper , despite its car chases and shootouts , is that soderbergh is always yanking things 90 degrees from the expected direction . it would have made for an even better film , however , if it never felt like a gritty vengeance caper because it actually _wasn't_ a gritty vengeance caper . give soderbergh credity for the convincing illusion that this genre film is something else . stylistic flourishes aside , the limey is just a pretty darned good straight-ahead action crime-drama -- provided you like them with relatively little action , and not all that much crime . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1666,"i have this sneaking suspicion that the extent to which viewers can appreciate dazed and confused may be limited by how readily they recognize it as a perfect capsule of mid-70s youth culture . it's a clever and completely un-self-conscious portrait of pot-smoking , beer-drinking teenagers revelling in the awareness that right now , nothing else really matters . as frequently as people tend to toss out comparisons between films , i think i can safely say that what american graffiti was to 1962 , dazed and confused is to 1976 . writer/director richard linklater's first feature was slacker , a quirky but gimmicky look at apathetic twenty-somethings that established his talent for creating unique and amusing characters . while many of the characters are recognizable high school types , what i found original was that these were types i actually recognized from high school , not from * movies * about high school . cool but basically decent randy interacts convincingly with both his jock buddies and the inexperienced mitch . linklater gives them sparkling dialogue , daring to let his characters talk like teenagers actually talk . the one major character failing in dazed is the absence of any equally interesting female characters ; many could be interchangeable . this is a male coming-of-age film first and foremost , but it could have been more inclusive . as a film without a real plot , dazed depends on set pieces and atmosphere . the hazing of the junior high girls is lively , as is a wacky monologue by the stoned slater about george and martha washington's fondness for marijuana . however , there's a fair amount of dead space , and it's left to the cast of unknowns to fill it . they are generally personable enough to do so , particularly wiggins and cochrane , but not always . as for atmosphere , it's dead on . dazed captures 1976 brilliantly , from the bell bottoms and feathered hair to the soundtrack of early hard rock classics to a pair of statues painted to look like members of kiss . the production design had to be perfect , and it is . anyone who can't quite recall a time when sex was safe and far fewer kids "" just said no "" should take a look just for the sake of historical accuracy . it's impossible for me to determine whether those not in my age bracket will be as enamored of dazed and confused as i was . it's a slight , loopy little film with no pretensions , and it was a page right out of my own youth . i don't know . . . maybe you had to be there . of course , * i * didn't inhale .

1667,"director : michael mann . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 155 minutes . in another place and time , he would have crafted operas -- grand-scale tales of human conflict blown up several times larger than life , accompanied by choruses and crescendos . neither the subject matter nor the genre alters mann's sense of the theatrical . the gothic horror of the keep , the cop/crook conflict of heat , the historical drama of the last of the mohicans -- all were treated as very important films , sometimes through sprawling running times , sometimes through lingering slow-motion images . mann's brand of operatic cinema has never quite been my cup of tea , and i was even more skeptical when i knew he had gotten his hands on material like the insider . this was , after all , a story about undeniably important issues : the insidious influence of corporate consolidation ; journalistic ethics ; the weighty responsibility of challenging the powers that be . could mann resist creating a film that would collapse under the weight of its self-imposed significance ? he could , and he did , though the insider is a much better personal story than it is a sweeping indictment of journalism-as-big-business . ironically , that pig-headed side of wigand is shown to be the reason he persists even when brown & williamson starts playing the hardest hardball . it's also the side that makes the insider most compelling -- and most unnerving -- as b&w begins digging up every possible speck of dirt from wigand's past to discredit him . it's a notion only a half-step removed from the tragic state of our political process -- the discouraging idea no sane man would open his entire history , warts and all , to public scrutiny . as long as the insider sticks close to wigand's story and the ever-mounting repercussions for his actions , it's pretty strong stuff . paper chase storytelling is tough to pull off , and mann does a more than serviceable job of finding drama in ethical debate . it's just that once again he's in opera man mode , giving pacino a stage for railing with righteous indignation ( a scenario that never does pacino any favors ) . the subject is interesting , but it is not about the deathknell of the free press . at more than two and a half hours , the insider starts to drag , and feels particularly out-of-control when mann drags in the unabomber story near the conclusion . mann does know how to make a moment of truth crackle ; he knows how to create compelling human stories . he doesn't always know when enough is enough -- when that next shot of someone walking in super slow-mo will feel overly pretentious , or when that wailing chorus will begin to grate on the nerves . eventually , even after plenty of solid filmmaking , you're just ready for that fat lady to hurry up and sing already . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1668,"director : robert deniro . after working with some of the finest directors of his time , deniro proves he's learned what goes into directing a good film with his first helming effort , a bronx tale . while his style frequently bears more than a passing resemblance to frequent collaborator martin scorsese , he's adept enough to get away with it , and adds enough of his own vision to make him credible . hang all of this on a strong story about a young man learning about life from two mentors and you have a solid , entertaining two hours at the movies . a bronx tale has been adapted from a one-man play by palminteri , and it has made an exceptional transition to the screen . it doesn't feel stagy like last year's adaptation of a few good men , and has an easy flow , even between the 1960 and 1968 segments . palminteri's script is full of colorful characters and evocative period atmosphere , and the first half in particular is also quite funny . however , i was far less engaged when the tone took a turn towards the overly serious and focused on racial tensions . the romance between calogero and jane felt forced , and ultimately i didn't think the climactic racial confrontation worked . the film had established such a unique and interesting central triangle of calogero , sonny and lorenzo that i was disappointed when that conflict took a back seat . the appeal of that conflict is part character , part performance . the two father figures are complicated characters portrayed by two fine actors . palminteri handles sonny just as deftly . calogero's moral uncertainty is real because the good guy and bad guy in a bronx tale frequently exchange hats . francis capra is very good as the mischievous young calogero , but i was less impressed by lillo brancato . he's a bit too blank , and adopts too many deniro mannerisms ( brancato won the part by doing an impression of deniro ) . jane is written basically as a "" type , "" and taral hicks looks painfully uncomfortable a great deal of the time . the combination of these two weaker performances only added to my antipathy toward the romantic subplot . robert deniro's direction , as i've noted , owes much to martin scorsese ; indeed , an early scene introducing the nicknamed regulars at sonny's bar is lifted straight out of goodfellas . deniro also displays scorsese's gift for pacing and crisp images . but this is more than a knock-off job . deniro's tone is lighter , more affirming and optimistic . in that respect , a bronx tale perhaps bears more resemblance to the current king of the hill than it does to goodfellas . it's a flawed film , but does considerably more right than it does wrong . a bronx tale is a coming-of-age fable in which robert deniro shows he has come of age as a filmmaker .

1669,"director : tim burton . mpaa rating : r ( violence , gore , adult themes , sexual situations ) running time : 102 minutes . watching sleepy hollow , you realize that tim burton could have made a definitive masterwork about the headless horseman . . . if anyone had given him a script that was actually about the headless horseman . changing source material -- even radically changing source material -- is nothing new in hollywood , so it's not terribly surprising to find only a passing resemblance between the film and washington irving's classic ghost story . there is plenty of splendid , grisly entertainment in burton's brand of quirky gothic horror , but it's bogged down in a story that's a cross between a parlor mystery and an episode of "" scooby doo . "" from its very first moments , sleepy hollow shows tremendous promise . here he's an eccentric revelation as the big city rationalist coping with supernatural phenomena . depp has a ridiculous amount of fun with crane's prissiness , and burton gets lots of mileage out of spraying him with blood . burton gets even more mileage out of the spectacular look of sleepy hollow , from the twisted woods to the gloomy town . he nails the spooky side of the story , combining effective action with flying body parts a-plenty whenever the headless horseman is at the center of the narrative . unfortunately , he's not at the center of the narrative nearly often enough . eventually , the film becomes focused on crane's efforts to understand the connection between the victims and who might be controlling the horseman . i wonder who might possibly care . the question of the head behind the headless horseman not only becomes an irritating distraction -- and means you can count on a tedious expository scene of the villain explaining his/her plan in excruciating detail -- it robs the horseman of too much power . andrew kevin walker's script ( tweaked by tom stoppard ) turns a primally frightening apparition into little more than hired muscle from beyond the grave . i suppose that one glaring misstep is so troubling because sleepy hollow has so much going for it as one of burton's typically grim fairy tales . between the delights of depp's performance and the dark enchantment of the production design , it's easy to start feeling the potential for brilliance . you only need to feel the energy level rise when the horseman is on screen to understand that detective work didn't really belong in this story . sleepy hollow may be somebody's idea of "" fleshing out "" washington irving's story , but what it really needed was less flesh and more ectoplasm . burton has made a wonderful monster movie from a script that doesn't understand this is a monster movie . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1670,"sometimes there is no better demonstration of a concept poorly executed than the same concept well executed . take tumbleweeds , for instance . sound familiar ? it should -- the plot is virtually identical to that of the current susan sarandon/natalie portman film anywhere but here . tumbleweeds just happens to be a rich character study that feels genuinely human , instead of like a hollywood construct . it doesn't start out looking that way . the wacky set pieces smack of contrivance , turning tumbleweeds into a low-budget variation on mainstream tales of female bonding . even the hand-held camera work starts to seem more like a contrivance than a tool to evoke a sense of urgency the very grittiness o'connor is aiming for becomes just another brand of glossiness . newcomer kimberly j . brown's performance as ava , which had seemed too rough around the edges , develops into something intriguing and unique , not at all the typical mature-beyond-her-years , foul-mouthed-beyond-prime-time movie kid . janet mcteer's brassy mary jo similarly blossoms into a character easy to understand but considerably harder to pin down . the relationship between the two shows all the twists , turns and knots of a complex mother/daughter pairing , but there's never a sense of manufactured conflict . these people behave like real people ; their battles don't sound scripted , and their interdependent affection is thoroughly convincing . brown and mcteer are both pretty darned good , but the reason tumbleweeds starts to work so well is that o'connor doesn't force the story to rest entirely on their shoulders . tumbleweeds gives its two central characters a context in which to operate , something sadly lacking in anywhere but here . verisimilitude isn't necessary for every kind of film , but it's fairly useful in a character study . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1671,"screenplay : atom egoyan , based on the novel by william trevor . director : atom egoyan . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity , sexual situations ) running time : 116 minutes . without revealing too much , it's fair to say that joseph hilditch ( bob hoskins ) is not what he appears to be . then again , it may not . felicia's journey , adapted by atom egoyan from william trevor's novel , is an investigation into relationship pathology that works beautifully while those pathologies remain enigmatic . for the first half of the film , egoyan darts and weaves through time and place , showing us both of the principal characters searching for someone to cling to . her search is clearly doomed from the start , but no less doomed than the quest of mr . hilditch . there's plenty of rich psychological material in the intersection of these two characters , and egoyan keeps it compelling for much of the running time . bob hoskins' performance anchors the material , creating a character that keeps the audience off balance . when hoskins wants you to feel for hilditch , you'll feel for him . hilditch develops in so many unexpected ways that the film's resolution can only come as a disappointment . egoyan is incapable of letting felicia's journey become a simple genre film , but he's stuck with genre conventions all the same ( though why he assented to mychael danna's clanking , ham-fisted instrumental score , i have no idea ) . as a dramatic climax , however , it's unsatisfying , a deus-by-proxy ex machina way for hilditch's eyes to be opened . and egoyan should henceforth resist the temptation to close his films with explicatory voice-overs ( see also : the sweet hereafter ) . those flaws might have crushed another film , but felicia's journey gets off to too solid a start . hoskins' performance alone makes felicia's journey worthy watching ; it's just a shame that such a subtle performance ends with such melodrama . "" things take a turn , "" hilditch ominously intones at one point , which could easily summarize felicia's journey . it's a turn that wrings simple quality from potential brilliance . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1672,"director : henry selick . if jurassic park proved one thing , it was this : image * is * everything . what the public seems to want most from movies is spectacle ; show them something they've never seen before , and they'll beat a path to the theater door , even if the story is fairly simplistic . this news should come as a great comfort to touchstone pictures and tim burton . the nightmare before christmas is a straightforward , somewhat bland fable which would have put me to sleep if done with live action or traditional hand-drawn animation . however , its stop-motion figures and incredible production design are dazzling enough to give nightmare a delightfully timeless quality which make it far more entertaining than it could have been . first , the good news : nightmare is truly unlike anything you've ever seen before . the look combines old rankin/bass christmas specials , edward gorey illustrations and the beatles' yellow submarine to create a remarkably distinctive and detailed world . the animation is incredibly fluid , to the extent that i began to wonder whether a couple of characters were real humans somehow edited into the film . it was the kind of film where i never took my eyes off the screen because i was afraid of missing something . director henry selick avoids the pitfall of "" showing off "" his toys ; he keeps the camera moving , telling the story visually with style and effectiveness , particularly jack's graveyard song after his christmas coup . the down side of this complex and expensive animation technique is that the story had to be packed into under 75 minutes . there is no time for nuance of character or well-developed motivations ; the filmmakers slam through the plot at a breakneck pace , avoiding lags in pace but also avoiding a truly engaging story . the villainous character of oogie boogie also comes up a bit short , and a slightly grumpy santa could have been very interesting . the story is a fairy tale , so i don't take issue with the simplicity of the plot . i was just disappointed with the apparent decision to throw everything into the visuals . perhaps most disappointing is the song score by frequent tim burton collaborator danny elfman . taking an operatic approach , nightmare is almost entirely through-sung , making the songs a crucial element of the film . but with the exception of the lively "" what's this ? "" during jack's discovery of christmas town , the tunes are fairly tedious and the lyrics lacking in wit . they seemed designed simply to move the story forward , not to inspire humability like the best ashman/menken tunes from the recent disney films . it's surprising given elfman's playful oingo boingo oeuvre that his songs here are so somber and uninspired . some movies are called feasts for the senses . the nightmare before christmas qualifies as a feast for the sense , singular . while there is very little worth listening to in the film , there is more than enough worth looking at to compensate , particularly for those with a slightly twisted sense of humor .

1673,"for more than forty years -- certainly since the 1956 film version of the king and i -- yul brynner has been the king of siam , and the king of siam has been yul brynner . actors often define roles , and roles often define actors ( the latter much to the actors' chagrin ) , but rarely as a role/actor identification been so strong , and so reciprocal . a yul brynner impression without the words "" puzzlement "" or "" et cetera "" just isn't a yul brynner impression ; a king of siam without a bald dome just isn't the king of siam . it is the authoritative grace with which chow pulls off that feat that makes anna and the king such an unexpected pleasure . since the story is ultimately an epic romance , nothing is more important to anna and the king's success than the connection between its principal characters . when necessary , he is convincingly aloof and regal , looking and behaving every bit the stern ruler . he also shows a wonderfully light touch , lending a devilish smile to his jabs at anna's strong will . even the more overtly emotional scenes -- clearly meant to pound home the heaviness of the head that wears the crown -- are nicely under-played . those familiar with chow primarily as an action star should take note : his versatility keeps the romantic angle in anna and the king fresh and convincing . he's not quite so lucky with the political angle . the double-dealings are pretty conventional stuff , leading to an exploding bridge climax that feels like it belongs in an entirely different film ( one directed by jan de bont , perhaps ) . in fact , anna and the king stumbles whenever director andy tennant draws too much attention either to finger-wagging at cultural imperialism ( a blowsy british merchant insulting mongkut at a dinner party ) or to his own direction ( an operatically staged beheading ) . even in a film that runs two and a half hours , there's just not enough time to spend away from its complicated central relationship . fortunately , anna and the king is ultimately redeemed by its splendor . no , not the splendor of luciana arrighi's production design or caleb deschanel's cinematography , though both pieces of work are exceptional . it's the splendor of chow yun-fat that carries anna and the king through its occasional stretches of anachronistic anti-colonial posturing and trite palace intrigue . creating the image of a king is a difficult enough task ; re-creating a king who is already an icon would seem to be thankless . chow is nothing less than a presence that takes over anna and the king -- with his humor , his poise , his majesty . . . et cetera , et cetera , et cetera . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1674,"topsy-turvy is not a bio-pic in the conventional sense of the term . it's a bio-pic in the mike leigh sense of the term , which may be redundant . however , it may not even be appropriate to call it a mike leigh film in the conventional sense of the term . one does not think of period pieces when one thinks of mike leigh , nor would one likely think of him as the ideal film-maker to look behind the scenes at the creation of gilbert & sullivan's "" the mikado . "" how would this fashioner of human drama approach the fashioning of light opera ? as it turns out , he does so with detail , detail and more detail -- occasionally to nerve-wracking excess . but the concept for "" the mikado "" is only the beginning of the arduous process of staging it . when topsy-turvy finally hits its stride , with gilbert's visit to the exposition , it's an extraordinarily entertaining piece of work . leigh dives into the pre-production process with gusto , exploring every possible element of a theater company's work . the rehearsal scene , in which gilbert attends to the details of pacing and the inconvenient absence of two actors , is hilarious even in its attention to the mundane ; a scene of gilbert using japanese women as advisors for cultural authenticity has a similarly unexpected charm . you know a film-maker is doing something write when he can wring comedy out of a wardrobe session , and drama out of whether or not a song will be cut from the production . it would be easy to embrace topsy-turvy unreservedly if leigh seemed to know what to cut from his own production . even at 160 minutes , the film never seems tedious ; it does , however , seem unnecessarily meandering . leigh also goes overboard in the inclusion of musical numbers , giving us full-scale recreations of at least a half-dozen songs from three different productions . while the inclusion of some gilbert and sullivan work would seem necessary as context , leigh takes too much liberty with the length and breadth of his musical interludes . by the end of topsy-turvy , you may feel you've sat through "" princess aida "" and "" the mikado "" in their entirety . in most films , the extra weight would probably have sunk the whole endeavor . blessedly , topsy-turvy is that rare film that gets better with every passing minute , building to that enchanting final hour of preparation for production . still more blessedly , leigh has put together another superb cast to give the scenes as much bite as possible , including leigh veterans like alison steadman ( life is sweet ) and timothy spall ( secrets & lies ) . broadbent's gilbert has a bit more to work with -- and hence the showier part -- but corduner's more amiable , artistic integrity-bound sullivan is a delight as well . leigh covers a lot of ground in topsy-turvy -- perhaps , ultimately , too much -- but he has the good sense to come back around to the good stuff . the result is a biography as singular as leigh himself : messy , insightful and , of course , very human . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1675,"brian depalma needs a hit * really * badly . it doesn't hurt any that he has latched on to a solid story and brought out dynamite performances from pacino and sean penn . carlito's way , while hampered by depalma's characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism , is a truly tense and engrossing drama . carlito's way will probably make the strongest impression with the two outstanding set pieces which bracket the film . yet for all the viscera , i found the character study even more compelling . but where the culmination of the godfather saga played like opera , there's more of an immediacy to carlito's way , an ever-present sense of doom launched by the title sequence which sets the flashback story in motion . you sense that there's no way , after so many years , that carlito can stay out of trouble . pacino captures carlito's dilemma with surprising subtlety and the cautious observation borne of years of experience watching every corner for an enemy . sean penn is even better , turning in his best performance to date as kleinfeld . he could have been simply pathetic , a heavy drinker and cocaine addict playing tough with guys way out of his league , but penn invests kleinfeld with tremendous nervous energy and an overwhelming survival instinct . as compelling as the narrative is , viewers may experience a profound sense of deja vu . depalma continues to steal shamelessly from other directors , this time adding scorsese to his repertoire with a point of view tracking shot and a copacabana scene with more than passing resemblances to goodfellas . he even recycles some of his own previous plagiarisms , like a 360 degree swing around a kiss ( vertigo via body double ) and the climactic shootout which will strike many as far too reminiscent of the train station sequence from the untouchables . from a story standpoint , there's an obligatory love story with a cliche'd long-suffering girlfriend character . penelope ann miller is a good but limited actor who doesn't do anything new with the role , and eventually she becomes just a distraction , never integrated fully enough into the story . still , it's easier to be forgiving of superficial flaws when the backbone is so solid . the two principle characters held an iron grip on my attention , one all the cinematic thievery in the world couldn't break . carlito's way plays like a tragic novel : deliberate , confident and powerful . those willing to grant depalma his tendencies towards the extreme should find themselves well- rewarded .

1676,"truth be told , i should disqualify myself from reviewing ruby in paradise . you see , i have a certain bias : i've fallen helplessly , hopelessly , desperately in love with ashley judd . as ruby lee gissing , the central character in writer/director victor nunez's low-key character study , judd delivers a phenomenally appealing performance , capturing a young woman's struggle to make her life better with frankness and intelligence . it moves very slowly , and virtually nothing substantive happens from a plotting standpoint . but that internal story is one rarely examined , the story of a young woman on a journey of self-discovery , and victor nunez handles it with gentle insight . she is filled with complex and conflicting emotions and attitudes--a basic morality colliding with her rejection of her religious upbringing , a hope that life can be better coupled with a certain cynicism . so much is conveyed in ruby's description of her first night with mike : "" and yes , we got it on , all tender and romantic . "" ruby lee gissing is one of the best written female characters to grace the screen this year . oh yes , and there's this ashley judd person . her portrayal of ruby is nothing short of stunning , a heartbreaking yet ultimately affirming take on one woman's strength of spirit . her pride in her own resourcefulness is captured in a comment to rochelle : "" i managed to get out without getting pregnant or beat up ; that's something . "" if ruby in paradise fails to be fully satisfying , it's because nunez doesn't surround ruby with characters one-tenth as interesting as she is . ricky is so slimy and transparent that he inspired hoots from most of the audience , and bentley mitchum is not subtle enough an actor to underplay the easiest mannerisms to overplay . todd field handles mike a bit better , but mike also is too much of a "" type "" instead of a person . "" mama's family "" and "" all my children "" veteran dorothy lyman could have been much more interesting as ruby's surrogate mother , but she's too cold in her early scenes and maintains a certain aloofness throughout . it's too bad nunez couldn't have invested as much in the featured players . ruby in paradise does drift somewhat , and its two hour running time is a bit much . still , it's amazing what one great character and one great performance can do for a slow-moving story , and ashley judd's ruby is worth the price of admission all by herself . ashley , if you're reading this , i'm in the book .

1677,"director : norman jewison . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence ) running time : 146 minutes . there are times when i'm watching a film and i just know it has fallen victim the demon expectations . audiences expect certain things from certain kind of films -- they expect love stories to end with a kiss , they expect horror films to end with a jolt , they expect action films to end with a big chase and/or a big explosion . the ebb and flow of traditional narrative becomes part of the way people watch movies , and film-makers know this . the familiarity is comforting ; it makes it easy for people to keep up . scripts are structured not exactly to give the people what they want , but to give them what they know -- which , for all practical purposes , is the same thing . the hurricane is a drama that follows a legal proceding , and it gives the audience what they expect by ending with a verdict . it's also a disappointing resolution for a story that's actually about so much more than guilt or innocence . the biographical background material , which had felt somewhat labored , starts to flesh out a portrait of carter's background of distrust of any force outside himself . denzel washington , after a number of roles in which his commanding presence was lost on mediocre material , turns carter into a character with a fascinating arc . unfortunately , the script begins taking the story into predictable , uninspired directions . the investigation consistently suffers from a sense of manufactured drama , as well as from the complete absence of character development for the three canadians ( they've been compressed from nine real-life individuals , so we can be thankful for small favors ) . it's obvious we're heading for a showdown before the bench , and a series of impassioned speeches about justice . and frankly , i didn't really care , because i knew every minute spent on the details of the case was a minute not spent exploring carter as a character . there is far too much to like about washington's performance -- and , to give credit where it's due , about newcomer shannon's performance as well -- for the hurricane not to be ultimately satisfying . the hurricane simply loses focus on its strengths at times , wandering into familiar territory for its emotional catharsis . in a sense , armyan bernstein and dan gordon deserve kudos for finding a compelling perspective in fusing their two source materials . it's hard not to wish that the film hadn't been more willing to let the audience find that perspective as well . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1678,"starring : robin williams , sally field , pierce brosnan , harvey fierstein . screenplay : randi mayem singer & leslie dixon . director : chris columbus . i've never been a member of the robin williams fan club . a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way , and i sometimes feel as though i'm watching a 40-year-old class clown . in his films , williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy-feely emotion , leading to wildly uneven performances . doubtfire seemed ready-made for the same problems , but instead it proves to be williams' best comic screen project yet . while it still contains some characteristic self-indulgence , mrs . doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly-laugh comedy served up with high energy . mrs . doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work , and basically it does so . the most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel , and thanks to the fantastic special makeup that's instantly believable . it may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film , making dustin hoffman's dorothy michaels look like milton berle . more problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell ; it's a bit hard to swallow that she doesn't recognize any of the voices as her husband's . perhaps the biggest contrivance we're asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs . doubtfire in a few minutes . there's more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask . fortunately , these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll . during the film , i was generally too busy laughing . after getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams' riffing , mrs . daniel's frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful , as is the climactic restaurant sequence , even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away . clearly , most of the credit for doubtfire's success goes to robin williams . it took putting him in drag , but for once he plays a comic character that isn't just robin williams with a different name . he thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire , and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foul-mouthed . his responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty , but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity . it's one of mrs . doubtfire's charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect , just people trying to be better . as miranda , sally field is solid in a background role , and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu . the children are also good , although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest . the supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing . it's easy to see mrs . doubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over , and it's true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common . doubtfire manages to carve out its own space , particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judge's decision and the ultimate status of daniel and miranda's relationship . doubtfire , but there are plenty of laughs , and good comedies are always in short supply . and it's nice to see robin williams just act for a change .

1679,"mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , nudity , adult themes ) running time : 105 minutes . it's entirely possible that a film version of the end of the affair -- graham greene's novel of passion , obsession and faith -- could be made without getting into the explicit details of its protagonists' extra-marital exploits . and in fact it already has , in a weepy 1955 version starring deborah kerr and van johnson . some would no doubt argue that the more restrained approach has its merits , but there's something about this source material that demands an approach that couldn't be filmed in 1955 . i can't remember the last time a mainstream film featured as much intense , forthright sexuality -- of the groping , grinding , gasping variety -- as the end of the affair . and i can't remember the last time it would have been quite so thematically appropriate . neil jordan's approach to much of the end of the affair is in fact fairly restrained . michael nyman's string score pulses throughout the film , adding a layer of heightened drama , but the performances play against the music effectively . ralph fiennes' work may be too reminiscent of his character in the english patient , but it's right for the role , as is stephen rea's hangdog henry . though the repetition of those scenes gives the film a slightly lurching pace , it also shows how easy it is to misinterpret key moments in our lives . his even bigger risk pays off even more definitively . let viewers go in forewarned : the end of the affair is a steamy affair , the sex scenes a deft tightrope act between pure animal passion and intense emotion . the end of the affair circa 1999 combines the appeal of old-fashioned tragic romance with greene's ahead-of-his-time psychology of irrational desire ( whether temporal or spiritual ) . it may make you uncomfortable , but you can't deny its honesty . jordan does an impressive job of making the novel's philosophical musings solid cinema , retaining all the thematic weight without too much ponderous voice-over . there's also the ongoing pleasure of ian hart's sharp , understated work as the private detective who takes tremendous pride in his professionalism . and even when they no longer fill the screen , the end of the affair's scenes of illicit eroticism linger like a memory of addictive high . jordan does justice to greene's 1950s narrative by doing what the 1950s couldn't do -- showing the middle of an affair that made the end of the affair a tragedy . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1680,"starring : mike myers , dana carvey , tia carrere , christopher walken . screenplay : mike myers , bonnie turner & terry turner . director : stephen surjik . "" wayne's world "" was already a minor miracle by the standards of "" saturday night live "" sketches before it ever made it to the big screen . where most snl premises exhaust all charm in roughly a minute , wayne and garth provided consistent laughs . then they tempted fate by turning a five-minute sketch into a full length film , and it became a huge , goofy hit . so the question became , would the inevitable sequel finally show a concept running on fumes ? wayne's world 2 is a collection of more good-natured pokes at popular culture , propelled by the infectious exuberance of mike myers as our hero . of course , plot ultimately means very little . wayne's world , in both its television and film incarnations , is about a generation whose collective consciousness is a swirl of pop culture icons . the gags play on both genre conventions and particular images , but somehow they manage to be sharper and more "" in "" than the slew of genre parodies which littered theaters this year . the best known targets in wayne's world 2 ( kung fu films , the graduate , the doors ) get the most extensive treatments , but myers isn't afraid to pull out obscure references to mahogany rush or 70's detergent and shampoo commercials . wayne and garth , for all the inevitable comparisons , are no beavis and butthead ; they're clever and sharp- witted , simply with all their literacy derived from the media . they're in on the joke with their audience , and they're willing to assume that audience can keep up with them . social commentary aside , wayne's world 2 is just plain laugh- out-loud funny . even the most obvious gags , like the performance of village people's "" y . m . c . a . "" which is destined to become this film's "" bohemian rhapsody , "" are handled with real zest . through it all struts mike myers , sporting wayne's trademark wiseguy grin . the sense of fun he pumps into wayne is almost always engaging , and most importantly he never seems to be trying to put anything over on his audience . as a performer , his enthusiasm can make up for numerous rough edges . and there are rough edges in wayne's world 2 . christopher walken's character is basically a retread of rob lowe's from the first film , but without the campy appeal . the dana carvey/ kim basinger segments never really worked for me , primarily because i generally find carvey annoying . overall , the direction isn't as creative as penelope spheeris' work in the first , but spheeris turned out the beverly hillbillies , so maybe that makes it even . like many recent sequels , wayne's world 2 includes copycat elements from its predecessor , but far fewer than most , and there's plenty of fresh fun to be found .

1681,"perhaps most significantly , american beauty became a critical and popular success with its cynical take on the facade of suburban bliss . it doesn't take long for a film's entire context to change . could judy berlin avoid feeling instantly , jarringly out-of-step ? in the case of judy berlin , such concerns probably seem silly , since its style is already so surreal and timeless . if judy berlin looks and plays like a suburban spin on a woody allen ensemble comedy , it shouldn't be surprising ; mendelsohn spent years as an assistant costume designer for allen films . essentially it's a character study , exploring the submerged longings of its suburban denizens that come to the surface only when the eclipse causes time to stand still . the veteran cast members deliver some superb performances , particularly kahn in a very funny yet very sad piece of work , and barrie as the not-well-liked teacher with an unknown inner life . judy berlin manages to hit some effective comic notes while always staying true to the small , very personal desires of even its peripheral characters . mendelsohn's main characters , however , fare less well . the title of the film tells us to focus on the interaction between david and judy as the thematic center , and , unfortunately , the center doesn't hold . david exists primarily as a stand-in for the filmmaker -- the frequent , nudgy references to the fact that we're watching a story that's going to be turned into a film don't help matters -- and hornick doesn't do enough with what is there . it's a very entertaining performance as an endearing character , but judy is more a symbol of possible escape than a fully-realized person . while david's mopey self-loathing may ultimately come in for affectionate mockery , that doesn't make it any easier to latch on to him as a protagonist , or to care about the fate of david and judy's relationship . even when he fumbles one of his sub-plots , mendelsohn keeps judy berlin enough on the sweet side of bittersweet that it remains appealing . the look ( jeffrey seckendorf's black-and-white cinematography ) and sound ( michael nicholas's piano and harpsichord score ) may contribute much to judy berlin's sense of timelessness , but the story itself plays a significant role . the characters in the film spend much of the running in place because they're always looking behind them . how refreshing to find a film that suggests there's something to look forward to -- even in the suburbs . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1682,"what planet are you from ? screenplay : michael leeson & garry shandling and peter tolan . producers : mike nichols , garry shandling and neil machlis . director : mike nichols . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , adult themes , nudity ) running time : 103 minutes . i started to get a sense for how good what planet are you from ? could be at around the fifth or sixth iteration of the gag . unfortunately , the men of this world have evolved without genitalia for lack of need , so harold is equipped with an artificial organ -- one that hums when he is aroused . as a gimmick , it's positively inspired , providing an auditory cue for every time harold starts feeling a bit randy . it's also a gimmick that could have grown really old really fast , turning what planet are you from ? into a one-joke movie without much to laugh at . i'm guessing that there are probably three dozen humming penis gags in what planet are you from ? and i'll be damned if i didn't laugh at every one of them . the reason the joke works for so long and with so many variations is that shandling ( who also co-wrote ) and company realize that you can still write a smart comic script that happens to include some lowbrow subjects ( he proved that point for several years on "" the larry sanders show . "" part high-concept comedy , part broad farce and part exploration of male-female dynamics , it's actually a clever spin on relationship tomes like "" men are from mars , women are from venus "" and "" you just don't understand . "" i suppose you could say what planet are you from ? is sort of an unruly film . actually , it's a _very_ unruly film , often leaping through sub-plots and minor characters too quickly to do them justice . goodman's troubles with his wife , which might have made a marvelous counterpoint to the alien's relationship troubles , instead serve as the source for a couple of throwaway gags . linda fiorentino is woefully underused as kinnear's femme fatale-ish wife , and there's a rushed feeling to all the scenes on harold's home world ( as though the budget wasn't quite there for a more thorough peek at their culture ) . for a film from mike nichols -- a director whose films almost always click with comic precision -- what planet is a bit ragged and scattershot . and it's also very , very funny . films with laugh-out-loud moments are embarassingly rare , which makes it all the more wonderful that what planet hits on so many levels of humor . the dialogue is full of the kind of razor-sharp punch lines that recall vintage woody allen . subtle bits of physical acting add kick to the simplest scenes ( watch for shandling's priceless change of expression during his first date with susan ) . predictable sight gags are given unpredictable twists . a weird shift to a hard-boiled exchange between shandling and goodman adds an effectivley bizarre late change of pace . even the warmer moments of gentle character humor work . but most of all , there's the gag -- not necessarily because it inspires the biggest laughs , but because it inspires the most . what planet are you from ? may be messy , but it sure is plenty entertaining . shandling and his cohorts prove that exquisite execution can take even the silliest concepts and make them . . . well , hum . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1683,"screenplay : pedro almodovar . director : pedro almodovar . pedro almodovar has always been a filmmaker with a world view that is -- to engage in a bit of understatement -- unique . he loves the blurry lines of sexuality ; he loves the complexities of romantic relationships . yet even when it comes to a subject like half the human race , almodovar won't do things the easy way . almodovar's critics have often accused him of being more fond of the conspicuously provocative than with genuine emotional content . and the plot thickens . . . or at least it gets dense with women on the verge of various breakdowns . in a sense , it's a lot like an art house spin on broad hollywood dramedies about the power of sistah-hood , with the male characters either utterly peripheral or half-female themselves . the reason all about my mother doesn't inspire world-class eye rolling ( like , for instance , hanging up ) is that almodovar really does want to make his characters complete . much of the comic relief is provided by the tart-tongued agrado , performed with depth beyond bitchy clichs by antonia san juan . almodovar's all-encompassing embrace of womankind could strike some viewers as inherently undramatic -- and in a sense , they'd be right . aside from the accident that claims manuela's son , there really isn't a pivotal plot moment in all about my mother . it's more of a general observation of the maternal instinct , with a magical medical cure thrown in for good measure . and it's hard to describe except to say that it works -- as character study , as off-beat comedy , as defense of unconventional matriarchy . you won't find many films that are simultaneously this warm and fuzzy and this weird . in the almodovar universe , you can hear those women roar in numbers too big -- and variations too strange and wonderful -- to ignore . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1684,"screenplay : kevin jarre . after a few decades when westerns were about as easy to find as jimmy hoffa , it seems like you can't sneeze at the movies these days without hitting a horse . tombstone is the name , ma'am , and surprisingly lively entertainment is the game . while no great piece of art , tombstone is a real old-fashioned shoot-em-up , energetically staged and acted and featuring a particularly memorable performance from val kilmer . but even that battle is not the end , as tombstone becomes the nexus of a blood feud which won't end until one side or the other is completely dead . it's action that tombstone is about first and foremost , and it delivers big time . there are few slow stretches , and they usually build towards something . the big shootout at the ok corral might be the least effective of the action pieces ; it's edited in a fairly confusing fashion which may accent the chaos of the situation but doesn't always make it clear who's shooting whom . otherwise the action is extremely well-choreographed , backed up by a bruce broughton score a bit too reminiscent of his work on silverado . fortunately , the action is where the comparisons to rambo end . tombstone is well-acted by its ensemble cast , in spite of the most distracting ( if authentic ) facial hair this side of gettysburg . kurt russell , never the most versatile of leading men , does bring an intense and reluctant heroism to wyatt . sam elliott and bill paxton are a bit more wooden in less-developed roles , but for the stoic and civic-minded earps it's not a distraction . sure , his lines are campy and anachronistic , but they are also quite funny . he drawls out his quips with a sly confidence , and turns in probably his best all-around performance yet . delaney is lovely , but her character is just a distraction ( as , unfortunately , are all of the female characters in tombstone ) , never adding anything in particular to the story or to wyatt's character . their scenes together seem simply to be a nod to the conventional wisdom that you need a love story to get women into the theater . while it's spending time wandering through the flowers , tombstone is nothing special , but when it sticks to its guns it generally finds its target .

1686,"screenplay : susannah grant . director : steven soderbergh . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 133 minutes . steven soderbergh has fashioned one of those careers that movie people always claim they want . he gets to make unconventional , experimental films like kafka , schizopolis and the limey , while still making a few bucks doing "" mainstream "" films like king of the hill and out of sight . yet "" mainstream "" truly belongs in quotes where soderbergh is concerned , since his approach to timeworn genres is as unconventional and his conventionally unconventional work . despite his popularity with the art house set , he has found it difficult to cross over to a broader audience , since he keeps baffling that audience by taking amiable entertainments and putting meat on their bones . you might think you know what to expect from a coming-of-age story or a crime caper , but did you really expect what soderbergh delivered in king of the hill and out of sight ? erin brockovich is another film -- a legal crowd-pleaser with a tart-tongued heroine -- that looks like you should know what to expect . leave it to soderbergh to make even that kind of you-go-girl hollywood premise uniquely appealing . in most films of this kind , you would expect a combination of sassy one-liners and courtroom theatrics . you do get some of the former -- courtesy a solid susannah grant script that gives roberts plenty of no-nonsense dialogue to bite into -- but there's a way roberts plays a line that keeps the film from degenerating into mundanely rabble-rousing chick flickery . roberts has her detractors , particularly when it comes to her dramatic performances , yet erin brockovich finds her effectively taming the glamour girl looks into a convincing character . even when she's snapping off one of erin's saltier tirades against the lack of recognition she's getting , roberts never seems to be waiting for a laugh . she does one of the hardest things anyone can do with a character like this : she refuses to play erin with a wink to the audience so we all know it's julia roberts beneath the bitter exterior . you also have to give soderbergh his share of the credit for knowing how erin needed to be played , but it's no surprise to find him in control of his material . in keeping with the less-than-sexy title of the film , soderbergh makes sure the case never overwhelms the character . while the lawsuit against pacific gas & electric makes for compelling drama , it's not as compelling as erin navigating the path towards self-respect . the story features elements familiar from a hundred legal investigation dramas in the grisham era -- the nasty corporate monolith , gutsy underdogs , saintly victims , etc . -- but erin brockovich always seems to find an unexpected angle just when it's most necessary . erin brockovich does take its conventional turns , and -- not coincidentally -- that's usually when it starts to meander . erin's romance with a soft-hearted biker named george ( aaron eckhart ) leads to a trite "" you care about your job more than your family "" confrontation ( think sissy spacek's whine in jfk with a little gender role reversal ) , and there's one moment of precocious sensitivity by erin's son matthew ( scotty leavenworth ) that almost makes you want to shudder . still , soderbergh and roberts bring too much crackling originality to erin brockovich for its study of character through hard work to suffer too much . i'm not sure steven soderbergh's erin brockovich will set audiences to applauding as they leave the theater . that would happen in another director's version , one where the predictable doesn't have a way of turning into the unpredictable . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1687,"mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , nudity , drug use , adult themes ) running time : 114 minutes . it took five months for boys don't cry finally to make its way to utah . and after five months , plenty of opportunity for the film itself to fall dangerously short of everything i wanted it to be . boys don't cry is not a great piece of film craftsmanship . it's a performance showcase , and a very effective one . the surprise , however , is that the real showcase performance isn't the most talked-about one . at the center of the story , of course , is the mystery of brandon/teena -- who he was , how so many people were fooled , what brandon's transformation represented as both threat and promise to the other people involved in the story . swank's physical performance is superb , made even more effective by co-writer/director kimberly peirce's decision to introduce brandon already in male guise so the switch doesn't become a showy trick . but it's hard not to be more impressed with the physical performance than with what's going underneath it . there are moments when you see the awkwardness of a girl trying to be one of the guys , and moments in the harrowing final half hour when you see her peering in terror through the cracks in her reality . more often , brandon is an enigmatic catalyst . it seems as though peirce is more interested in what brandon stands for than in the person that was brandon teena . the upside to that perspective is that one of those people is lana , played with unnerving effectiveness by chloe sevigny . lana is in her way a more fascinating character than brandon -- she engages in just as much self-delusion , but her motivations are more complex . it's the sort of role most actresses would play initially with hard-edged bluster before unveiling the heart of gold beneath ; sevigny shows a slightly different perspective of lana every time she turns around . sevigny is part of a superb supporting cast , with sarsgaard and sexton similarly refusing to play their parts for easy interpretation . the entire milieu of the falls city youth has a heartbreaking genuineness to it -- particularly noteworthy is how lana's mother becomes "" mom "" to everyone in their desperation for any family relationship -- and peirce does a fine job of using brandon to explore the effect of a nonconformist on a place where reality is assumed to be static . it's the idea that peirce uses brandon at all that dampens the power of boys don't cry , however . the chilling resolution and wonderful supporting performances make it easy to recommend boys don't cry . i only wish that five months of focus on hilary swank hadn't led me to expect it would be the story of brandon teena . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1688,"starring : robert duvall , richard harris , sandra bullock , piper laurie , shirley maclaine . screenplay : steve conrad . director : randa haines . hollywood films focusing on the elderly have generally fallen into two broad categories : comedies making them lovable codgers whose most mundane physical activity is turned into slapstick , and melodramas about loneliness and facing death . we've already had one from column a this winter--grumpy old men--which makes it somewhat surprising to see wrestling ernest hemingway so soon , even though it falls under column b ; studios are notoriously fastidious in avoiding conflict with target demographics . wrestling ernest hemingway is melodramatic , and its pacing is rather slow , but it is also filled with fine acting and quirky but believable relationships , and ultimately proves quite satisfying . the only time that hemingway really missteps is in its forced plot . director randa haines ( children of a lesser god ) plays up scenes like a shared skinny-dip and a certain male bonding ritual on the 4th of july , which come off as more than a little silly , and the score by michael convertino is enough to make one's teeth ache . it is to his credit that when he lets his characters talk to each other , things get much more interesting . yet this central relationship is only one of several which truly shine . she demonstrates a genuine affection for him , one which never comes off as patronizing ; their connection is sweet and very affirming . from top to bottom , the cast creates a rich and real collection of characters whose interplay is exceptionally touching . it would be unfair to complete a review of wrestling ernest hemingway without giving the two central performances their due . harris , as usual , is bigger than life , but the role of frank calls for such a reading , and it is testemony to his craft that frank never seems pathetic . a lesser actor would have turned in a much more mannered performance , overdoing walter's habit of inspecting his beloved bacon sandwiches before eating them . their screenwriter and director force them to jump through some unnecessary hoops , but when they're left to do their own thing , wrestling ernest hemingway becomes an appealing drama about the need for contact .

"" there's even a disney voice veteran in kevin kline , who previously worked on the hunchback of notre dame . the basic story progression is familiar , and the obligatory musical numbers are feeling a bit more obligatory all the time . it's pretty fair to say that the road to el dorado doesn't do anything radically different than the dozen or so disney animated features that have preceded it . then again , why mess with success ? the makers of the road to el dorado seem to understand that telling a good story with wit and excitement will be enough to satisfy virtually anyone . they begin with a pair of roguishly likeable protagonists -- well-performed by kline and branagh and splendidly animated -- who carry the story effectively . directors bibo bergeron and will finn lead them through a series of wild , high-spirited action sequences , unobtrusively combining computer-generated details and traditional cel animation . and the script and the character animation provide more hearty laughs than a dozen recent live-action comedies . sure , there's a formula to the road to el dorado , but it rarely seems like those involved are content to let their film feel formulaic . within the constraints of their genre , everyone is working to keep the film lively and appealing . the road to el dorado certainly isn't the most inspired animated film to come down the pike . the character development is a bit sketchy , the villainous tzekel-kan doesn't get enough time to show his villainy and even a toned-down rosie perez is still rosie perez . it's not a dazzling visual spectacle , and it's not going to move anyone to tears . it is , however , the kind of sturdy , generally smart film craftsmanship that shows up far more often when a world is drawn than when it's photographed . maybe it's the unique creative perspective of animators ; maybe it's the freedom inherent in creating a world from scratch . or maybe it's just one of those golden ages we here so much about but experience so rarely . the road to el dorado may not be solid gold , but it continues an impressive string of animated features worth spending your silver on . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1691,"i wish i hadn't known so much about i'll do anything . i wish i hadn't known that it was written as a musical , and that the songs had been edited out after disastrous test screenings . i wish i hadn't found myself trying to guess where the songs would have gone , or wondering what might have been different . then maybe , just maybe , i would have enjoyed it even more than i did . as aware as i was of its bumps , i was still mostly delighted by i'll do anything , and the reason why can be summed up in two words : whittni wright . the fact is that i'll do anything shouldn't have worked at all . kavner's watching brooks schmooze in a posh restaurant ? ) , or to notice some particularly choppy editing . the hollywood satire element never really hits stride , because it doesn't hit hard enough and because the player already did it better . ullman's character sports an appalling georgia accent , and the six year time shifts don't allow for any rhyme or reason to her eventual , rather tenuous emotional state or why she spoils jeannie so terribly . there are plenty of holes in i'll do anything , and a few more might have spelled disaster . consequently , i consider it fortunate that i fell in love with whittni wright the moment she appeared on screen . wright is a magnificent jeannie , reducing matt to a whimper of "" i have absolutely no idea what to do when she throws a spectacular temper tantrum on a plane . unlike so many young performers , she never struck me as overly precious or self-aware , just winningly adorable . as many times as "" parent learns responsibility "" stories have been done , i was still completely charmed by this one . nolte and wright are great together , and i found myself smiling almost every minute they were on screen together . as he has done in his previous films , terms of endearment and broadcast news , james l . brooks fills the screen with quirky characters and clever dialogue . joely richardson is lovely and appealing as cathy , the development exec who wants to take a stand but can't quite work up the nerve , and she uses her splayed-leg sitting position to give cathy an aura of perpetual insecurity . albert brooks is good but underused as the cocky big-budget producer , and julie kavner gets off some of the best lines as the voice of honesty . it's too bad the relationships between those characters are generally so sketchy , gutted of some of their emotion byt the removal of the production numbers . still , the one relationship that really mattered worked so well that i was tremendously forgiving . i'll do anything may not be the smoothest of rides , but nolte and wright did such a fine job of winning my heart that i was more than willing to take that ride with them .

1692,"long have i sung the praises of bonnie hunt , one of cinema's most effortlessly entertaining comic actresses . it also always seems to be the case that her small parts have been in bad films ( with the occasional notable exception like jerry maguire ) , a phenomenon that has baffled me to no end . i ask the gods of cinema : why can't someone who brings so much to her every role find scripts that do her talents justice ? too often , i have been left unanswered . the premise almost sounds like one of those semi-supernatural romantic comedies where a beloved spouse is somehow transformed into a member of the same sex , or a daughter's boyfriend , or a houseplant . such business actually plays no part in return to me , which downplays the otherworldly element in bob and grace's relationship . duchovny is surprisingly effective as a romantic lead , and driver is growing more luminous by the day , but their romance doesn't always feel like the central point of the film . where many romantic comedies set up the protagonists in a vacuum , return to me comes dangerously close to making the protagonists themselves the vacuum . if that's the case , it's only because there's so much wonderful business going on on the periphery . she's nearly matched by james belushi as her bearish , irresponsible husband , whose propensity for swearing in front of the children is good for laughs that should feel cheap , but somehow don't . hunt and co-writer don lake craft rich , funny situations so appealing that you wish every writer took half as much care developing supporting characters . of course , many writers take more care developing main characters . with a bit of hindsight , return to me feels more hollow than it should given all the laughs it generates . hunt doesn't even seem entirely comfortable with how to build to her big payoff , following up a reunion between bob and grace with a coda that really should have preceded it . still , i'm not sure i can recall the last time i responded to a scene as shamelessly romantic as bob's timid request to hold grace's hand . i certainly don't recall the last time a writer seemed so willing to share the wealth with the punch lines . return to me is a bit ragged , a bit sloppy , a bit overly concerned with the people surrounding its heart-linked lovers . it is , however , undeniably charming in its way . i'd expect nothing less from bonnie hunt , whose own undeniable charm has gone into a love story for underappreciated comic supporting performers everywhere . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1693,"director : errol morris . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , mild profanity ) running time : 90 minutes . we're going to have to create a new designation for errol morris , because "" documentary filmmaker "" just doesn't seem to cut it . yes , morris' subjects have all been real-life people in films like the thin blue line , a brief history of time and fast , cheap & out of control . it's no wonder morris' films have consistently been overlooked by the more tradition-bound documentarians of the motion picture academy . call him a maker of non-fiction films if you must . . . or simply a director . with mr . death : the rise and fall of fred a . leuchter , jr . , errol morris has given us another reason to toss out the term "" documentary filmmaker "" -- as striking as the film is , it sometimes feels a bit thin on background detail . while activists argue that leuchter's work for revisionist groups marks him an anti-semite , morris paints a slightly different picture . it would be a helpful bit of information in the formation of that picture for us to know that leuchter's academic background had nothing to do with engineering or chemistry , but was in fact in history . though leuchter does discuss a move by the state of massachusetts to prosecute him as an unlicensed engineer late in the film , his background would seem to be much more important than the casual inclusion morris gives it . in fact , mr . morris lets leuchter talk about himself for a very long time , but he doesn't probe . in this case , the approach leaves holes in the story . that doesn't make mr . death a failure as a film . indeed , a less-than-perfect errol morris documentary is still infinitely more watchable than most conventional documentaries . some viewers may find his stylized renderings of his subject -- leuchter the coffee addict reflected in a cup of coffee ; leuchter filmed between flashing electrodes like a modern dr . frankenstein -- distracting or inappropriate . it is surprising , however , that this may be the first morris' documentary that's more interesting as a cinematic experience than it is as a learning experience . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1694,"producers : dino de laurentiis and martha de laurentiis . director : jonathan mostow . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , profanity ) running time : 116 minutes . i'll tell you how u-571 ends : the good guys win . i'll let on another key piece of information : when two characters are engaged in conversation during a non-combat moment , you can bet your life that there should be a bright red neon sign beneath the characters' faces that flashes the word "" foreshadowing "" over and over again . moral complexity ? psychology ? subtext ? u-571 is a relentless plot machine . it's narrative film-making stripped down to the barest essentials : a plot , people to move the plot forward and a director to set the pace . and he's very good at wringing every last drop of adrenaline out of his propulsive , generic tales . the emphasis should be on the word "" crew , "" because it's not particularly easy -- or , in fact , necessary -- to distinguish between individual crew members . the rest of the bunch either play necessary plot roles -- the radio operator ( jack noseworthy ) keeps us up to date on exactly how close to disaster our protagonists are ; the vaguely unsavory military intelligence operative ( jake weber ) is around to remind us they must succeed or die trying -- or have endearing nicknames like tank , rabbit or trigger . i have now effectively put as much time into delineating the individual characters as the screenwriters did . thank you for your time , mr . noseworthy , and here's your check . ordinarily , an action film with such a minimal concern for its human beings sets me to slumping despairingly in my seat . mostow , on the other hand , has a knack for keeping me on the edge of it . u-571 takes us from one almost-impossible situation to another , never allowing the film to rest long enough for the whole enterprise to seem shallow . there would seem to be only so many ways to make spraying water , shuddering submarines and nautical maneuvers exciting , but mostow finds every one of them . you know you're in the hands of a gifted action film-maker when you find yourself watching scenes that should have you scoffing , but instead have you cringing in anticipation . there's not a reason in the world to care about any of the people on board u-571 , except as representations of our noble fighting men . mostow managed to keep me enthralled in the fate of a sub full of puppets . of course it would have been preferable for u-571 to seem a bit more concerned with men under fire . in a way it's a throwback to the world war ii films of a bygone era , interested primarily in waving the flag for the bravery of those who whipped jerry into submission . circa 2000 , you can also add big-budget special effects and killer sound to the mix ( do yourself a favor and see it in a theater that will have you shrinking from the straining walls ) . and you can add jonathan mostow , a director who's never going to be confused with eric rohmer when it comes to exploring the nuances of the human condition . the man can keep you hanging on to your armrests , though , and that's a rare talent . u-571 doesn't take its sub to any great depths . it just keeps the boat rockin' . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1695,"in print and television interviews , everyone associated with reality bites has been trying desperately to convince potential viewers that it's not a "" generation x "" movie , but just a simple romantic comedy . yeah . right . reality bites follows slacker ; singles ; and bodies , rest & motion in the sweepstakes to most accurately capture the 20-something zeitgeist , but i found it more reminiscent of star winona ryder's breakthrough film heathers . while reality bites does include some very funny moments and finely observed insight , it also tends to reduce its central characters to a collection of kitschy bon mots . reality bites is strongest on the level of details and the number of individual laughs of recognition they provide . i will admit to participating in a group sing-along of "" conjunction junction "" like these characters , and to playing games based on sit-com episodes . vickie is perhaps the most recognizable type to me ; i know a few people who cover their walls with old music posters and beg for you to turn up bad power pop songs with memories of junior high school dances . more so than singles , reality bites identifies the sense of ideological drift that characterizes americans in their mid-20s , but without the moody self-importance of bodies , rest & motion . this is not to say that childress doesn't also give in to easy stereotypes . every parent in reality bites is characterized by a cartoonish materialism , and becomes an easy target for blame . the romantic triangle doesn't have quite the impact it could have had because as attractive as ryder is , she doesn't seem nearly as interesting as , say , vickie . troy is an even more problematic character , a first class self-absorbed jerk who philosophizes in bastardized advertising jingles . the transformation childress tries to foist off on us is far too contrived , and she seems too willing to let troy's attitude stand as an acceptable response to the world he perceives . fortunately , they are somewhat balanced by two delightful supporting performances . comic janeane garofolo ( tv's the larry sanders show ) is hysterical as vickie , displaying a natural timing which makes the most mundane lines funny . director ben stiller is charming as lelaina's perpetually flustered suitor , and should be congratulated for risking the hesitating delivery which makes his character appear very real . i have to note that i was extremely disappointed by the ending of reality bites , but that may say more about me than about the film . while there are numerous character stumbles , overall i felt the tone was on target , and i laughed a lot . reality bites off a bit more than it can chew , but it all goes down eventually .

1696,"producers : kevin spacey , elie samaha and andrew stevens . director : john swanbeck . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 90 minutes . raise your hand if the idea of a film version of a single-set , dialogue-heavy play sets your pulse racing . keep it up in the air if you'd like to cross that with a story about the hard-knocks life of professional salesmen . stage-to-screen translations are hard enough without dealing with the inherent limitations of a single location . and you can't imagine there's anything left to be said about salesmen that arthur miller didn't slap a copyright on fifty years ago . technical stagnancy and narrative familiarity -- yep , sign me up for a double dose of that . it's hard not to go into a film like the big kahuna without fearing the worst , which makes it all the more impressive when it turns out to be a splendid acting showcase with a few eye-opening bits of wisdom . spacey is predictably sensational as the marketing rep for whom honesty has become a religion ; there may not be a performer around who can be so pleasantly venomous . it is surprising to see devito match spacey's stride in what may be his best film performance ever . phil's voice of experience carries a regret that's almost tangible , turning his every utterance into something you trust implicitly as true and worth knowing . facinelli has the least eye-catching role , but that doesn't mean he's a week link ; it's just bob's job to listen and learn . between spacey and devito , there's enough blistering comic dialogue to keep three films afloat . there's also a surprising core of understanding in the big kahuna about the nature of salesmanship . the film's hard-nosed philosophy -- which wraps god and industrial lubricants in one not-so-tidy package -- is likely to make plenty of viewers uneasy , but it's a challenging perspective on proselytizing as a question of product , rather than process . the subject proves to be only one of several on which rueff offers insights that keep you hanging on his dialogue . it's the only way a talk-intensive film like the big kahuna can work : between the wicked wit and the provocative ideas , you're too afraid to miss something to let your attention wander . director john swanbeck does have some trouble overcoming the inherent limitations of his setting . he does include a trio of well-crafted fantasy sequences , including one that makes wonderful use of facinelli's resemblance to a certain a-list star in a sequence involving fancy bartending moves . still , it's essentially a film in which three characters take turns talking to each other , a set-up that's never going to produce the most visually arresting cinema . the only reason to watch the big kahuna is not to watch it , but to listen to it -- to absorb some fine writing and the work of actors who know what to do with it . it's enough to remind you that solid execution trumps low expectations every time . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1697,"screenplay : richard curtis . director : mike newell . where romantic comedy is concerned , i am a tough sell . too many of them seem to put across the impression that all you need to do is put two people on the screen and have them end up together , regardless of whether or not they are developed with an interesting conflict ( or even speak to one another , as in the monstrously overhyped sleepless in seattle ) . i'm not going to turn into a pile of goo every time i see a screen kiss , but i will respond if i've spent two hours with two well-developed characters who seem to belong together . the new british comedy four weddings and a funeral delivers only halfway . hugh grant turns in a charming , star-making performance in this uneven character piece , but andie macdowell always appears to be more of a prop than a person . four weddings and a funeral was written by richard curtis , co-creator of the popular british television import "" black adder , "" a series not renowned for its sentimentality . and four weddings is extremely winning when it's not focusing on relationships . there are enough of these lively set pieces that four weddings rarely lags for too long , and the laughs come at fairly regular intervals . part of the problem is that in an attempt to create yet another ensemble friends piece he overloads the film with supporting characters , giving short shrift to the crucial relationship between charles and carrie . only james fleet , as befuddled aristocrat tom , provides any spark to the proceedings . the simple fact is that i kept losing track of the relationships between all these people , and didn't particularly care when i could figure them out . this lack of focus is inexcusable considering the cursory treatment carrie's character is given . part of four weddings and a funeral's message about love is that we should all be looking for that one person who makes "" lightning strike , "" and while the romantic sentiment is laudable it also assumes that we as an audience should recognize it when we see it . hugh grant , looking frighteningly like harold lloyd in his horn-rims , is an absolute delight ; he turns charles into a wonderful , funny , fallible character , and we want to see him happy . but carrie is simply a plot device . we know virtually nothing about her except that charles has a crush on her , and andie macdowell is not subtle enough an actress to fill in the blanks . it also might have been helpful to understand charles' romantic history better , which could have been accomplished through a more complete picture of ex-girlfriend henrietta , but that too is absent . there is much to recommend four weddings and a funeral as a comedy ; it's bright and spirited and well-paced . as a romance , it leaves much to be desired . . . primarily a second party for the romantic pairing .

1698,"screenplay : alfred gough & miles millar . director : tom dey . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , profanity , drug use ) running time : 110 minutes . jackie chan in another buddy action-comedy -- now there's something i didn't think i ever needed to see again . sure , the formula proved extremely successful in 1998's $141 million hit rush hour . it also meant jackie chan fans had to endure the human audio torture device that is chris tucker , and that studios would persist in their foolish perception that american audiences might not embrace a film with chan as its solo star . shanghai noon looked like a disaster waiting to happen -- formula piled upon formula , cheap gag piled upon cheap gag , jackie chan in another buddy action-comedy . the quirky actor does something few actors have the ability to do : he can make you forget you're watching a formula film . there is something so instantly and immensely likable about chan that it's almost unfair that he's also so physically gifted . his stunt work is again in top form in shanghai noon , finding more creative props for chan to use as weapons against his foes : saplings , moose horns , horseshoes , a railroad log car , etc . director tom dey and editor richard chew don't do chan's work optimum justice -- too many sequences are chopped up when it has proved infinitely smarter over the years to let the camera sit still and watch chan at work -- but they still possess that unique capacity to dazzle . a movie fight sequence is usually an obligatory piece of action business ; a jackie chan fight sequence is the reason you never want to leave your seat during the action . and owen wilson is the reason you never want to leave your seat during the exposition . his o'bannon is a great , goofy comic creation , a big talker whose primary reason for being in the outlaw game appears to be impressing women . any number of actors probably could have pulled off that characterization , but it's far more difficult to give it the strangely off-hand charm wilson provides . his performance cashes in on the incongruity of his surfer-casual line readings , but it never depends on that incongruity . there's just something unexpectedly funny about the way wilson handles even the most mundane , predictable moments . i spent half of rush hour pleading for chris tucker to get off the screen so i could enjoy jackie chan . no such problems in shanghai noon -- i felt a silly grin plastered across my face no matter which actor was being showcased . if the raw material of shanghai noon had been stronger , it could have been a truly inspired comedy . writers alfred gough and miles millar pump some clever lines into the script , but it's still a bit too dependent on making fun of the names pei pei and chon wang ( or rib-nudgingly naming one nasty cowboy van cleef ) . then there are the lumbering plot development scenes , including references to chinese railroad labor that seems included primarily for a sense of anachronistic moral superiority . in fact , the entire premise feels like a grand distraction from the appeal of the two stars , whose work individually and as a team blows the material away . i'm not sure what sort of setting might have served them better , and it almost feels like quibbling to wonder . chan and wilson simply make shanghai noon loads of fun . it's the sort of buddy action-comedy that wipes some of the stigma away from the term . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1699,"screenplay : karey kirkpatrick . mpaa rating : g running time : 85 minutes . nick park's three wallace and gromit shorts for aardman animation -- a grand day out , the wrong trousers and a close shave -- are examples of inspired , brilliant film-making . park's feature film debut -- chicken run , co-directed with peter lord -- is not . sometimes it's hard to accept simple quality when you've come to expect genius ; i suspect i'll cry a river of tears when john lasseter finally produces a film that's merely good . chicken run is unlike virtually any other animated film you're likely to see this summer , and not just because the characters are manipulated pieces of clay instead of drawings or cgi creations . it's an appealing , well-crafted film with a unique sensibility and a few wonderfully imaginative scenes . and its script can't manage one-tenth of the wit verbally that the rest of the film creates visually . after all , if rocky can fly , he can surely teach the chicks of tweedy farm a thing or two about getting airborne . the broad structure of chicken run is a satire of world war ii pow films -- ginger and her pals are "" inmates "" of coop 17 -- but the genre gags form only a tiny part of the film . the rest of the narrative involves a fairly banal bickering relationship between ginger and rocky , occasionally jazzed up by a nod to the love-hate relationship between brits and yanks . the dialogue could have stuck to that angle for its humor , but screenwriter karey kirkpatrick instead opts for a seemingly endless litany of ghastly puns . gibson , sawalha and many of the other performers do energetic voice work , despite the absence of much energy devoted to developing characters . as long as the characters are flapping their beaks , chicken run is fairly limp stuff . that chicken run soars highest when it's silent probably comes as no surprise to wallace and gromit devotees , who know that park has a gift for elaborately constructed sight gags . chicken run's finest moments showcase that gift , from the opening credits montage of ginger's unsuccessful escape attempts to the climactic mid-air showdown with mrs . tweedy . in between , there's the deliriously funny sequence in which rocky comes to ginger's rescue when she's strapped into an automated chicken pot pie-making machine . the clockwork comic timing is vintage nick park , with the nods to raiders of the lost ark actually underplayed so that they simply add flavor to an already priceless set piece . and then there are tiny pleasures like a teapot disguised as a hen , and a group of hens in a synchronized tai chi display . the depth and texture of the clay-mation world is satisfying enough ; the things the film-makers do with that world are a joy to behold . there's nothing about the aardman style that demands the animated equivalent of silent film storytelling ; the classic short creature comforts wedded person-on-the-street dialogue with clay critters to charming effect . this particular story , however , has the processed flavor of a dozen other animated films . the characters never get enough chance to develop the personality gromit packs into one furrowing of his plasticine brow , because they're too busy clucking off kirkpatrick's one-line groaners . i'm thoroughly convinced nick park has a positively glorious feature film in him -- perhaps it's the wallace and gromit feature planned for a few years hence -- but this one isn't quite it . it's an entertaining warm-up , a few bits of brilliance packed in disposable kiddie fluff . in short , it's simply good . when you've got a genius at your disposal , that's not quite good enough . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1700,"me , myself & irene ( 20th century fox ) starring : jim carrey , renee zellweger , chris cooper , robert forster , richard jenkins , anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon . screenplay : peter farrelly & mike cerrone & bobby farrelly . directors : bobby farrelly & peter farrelly . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , sexual situations , violence ) running time : 116 minutes . the national alliance for the mentally ill went public ten days before the release of me , myself & irene with a protest of the film's flippant tone towards multiple personality disorders . they were offended , which is not an uncommon reaction to a farrelly brothers movie . in fact , it was probably a shrewd move on nami's part to beat the rush condemning me , myself & irene . farrelly brothers movies -- including kingpin and there's something about mary -- are tasteless , crude and , yes , occasionally offensive . they're also funny in the sort of i-can't-believe-i-actually-saw-that way usually associated with vintage mel brooks , or the zucker-abrahams-zucker team . there's nothing remotely ennobling about me , myself & irene , the story of charlie baileygates ( jim carrey ) , a rhode island state trooper with a little problem . fans of there's something about mary -- and i count myself quite squarely among them -- may find irene a bit disappointing by comparison . carrey and zellweger aren't nearly the perfect comic odd couple ben stiller and cameron diaz were , nor is carrey the sort of comic performer whose ordinary guy demeanor works to balance the farrellys' warped sensibilities . the story is an unnecessarily convoluted parade of double-crossing characters involved in a dirty business deal the specific nature of which i still can't explain . there are a few missed opportunities , like ignoring genial narrator rex allen , jr . for much of the film . and like the farrellys' previous films , it's easily 15 minutes longer than it needs to be , padded with musical cues that only distract from the real reason for watching a farrelly brothers movie : seeing what gut-busting affront to good taste they'll come up with next . mere words can't possibly do justice to those affronts . irene's finest moments may not reach the epic heights of mary's zipper or hair gel scenes , but they come close . sometimes it seems that it's a long time between laughs in a farrelly brothers movie , but maybe that's a good thing . often , you still haven't recovered from the last one five minutes ago by the time the next one rolls around . i'm not about to delve into whether or not nami was "" right "" in criticizing irene for its approach to multiple personality disorder , including repeatedly using "" schizo "" as a synonym . i do know that me , myself & irene strikes me as a wildly comic spin on the incredible hulk more than anything else , with carrey's contorted transformations a special effect all by themselves . that's only part of the amazingly adept physical comedy carrey pulls off , battling with his own body like steve martin in all of me . . . or , come to think of it , like carrey himself in liar liar . me , myself & irene may be uneven and peculiarly violent in its resolution , but it's pure in its refusal to sentimentalize anything . everything is profane and nothing sacred in the farrelly universe . maybe that is worth protesting . or maybe , when you're laughing so hard that you forget to be offended , it's worth applauding . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1701,"screenplay/director : guillermo del toro . horror films with any semblance of wit or style are so rare that i'm tempted to be even warmer in my embrace of cronos than my head tells me to be . this mexican import puts a unique spin on its tale of a search for eternal life , features some extremely arresting imagery and has a nicely twisted sense of humor . yet as much as i admired the artistry of cronos , i couldn't help but notice a gaping hole at the center , namely a central character who steadfastly refused to engender any sympathy . a viewer willing to overlook its lack of heart will be rewarded by a project full of a new director's excitement at being allowed to realize his vision . thanks to the half-dozen or so credits which precede the title , cronos reportedly boasts the second highest budget in mexican film history ( behind only like water for chocolate ) , and guillermo del toro leaves it all on the screen . true , the make-up effects seem cheesy by modern standards , but elsewhere cronos sports a high polish . also noteworthy is the cronos device itself , and del toro's creative use of it , including showing its elaborate inner workings . director of photography guillermo navarro shoots the film with an emphasis on big spaces , and the result is a deliciously spooky atmosphere . for all its visual flair , cronos may be most satisfying on the level of del toro's off-beat sense of humor . guillermo del toro manages to put a lot of bite into his script , in more ways than one . there is that one big problem , though : jesus gris is completely bland . del toro doesn't connect jesus' fate with his character in any noticeable way ; in fact , it might be a stretch to say that jesus has a character . with his ultra-symbolic name , you would assume that there might be some attempt to go deeper into the psychology of his "" resurrection .

1702,"producers : george faber and charles patterson . director : roger michell . mpaa rating : unrated ( could be r for profanity , violence and adult themes ) running time : 101 minutes . it's a small bit of business , only one of many in the film , but it shows how interested director roger michell and screenwriter anne devlin ( working from mary costello's autobiographical novel ) are with establishing character . over the course of the film , bernie becomes a bona fide political celebrity , though not a much-beloved one . what's extraordinary about bernie is that she's so un-extraordinary . she's simply a house-proud mother concerned more with keeping her kids alive than making a statement . this simple focus on a simple but very determined woman helps titanic town avoid the most common pitfall of films set against a political struggle : it never stops to lecture about the futility of war or to make any other grandiose statement about the events that form its backdrop . walters delivers a witty , thoroughly engaging performance as bernie , who stumbles into a position as spokesperson by sheer accident . bernie is such a solid center of the film that its sub-plots often feel fairly thin by comparison . nothing else in the film is ever quite as compelling . that one story is still compelling enough to keep titanic town moving briskly , and to offer a vivid insight into the chaos of 1970s belfast . films about big issues need those small moments to keep them human . titanic town is never the monolith its title might suggest . tragedy sometimes appears in a form less like a sinking ship than like an unmade bed . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1703,"screenplay : christopher mcquarrie . director : christopher mcquarrie . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 119 minutes . the way of the gun -- the directing debut by oscar-winning screenwriter christopher mcquarrie ( the usual suspects ) -- opens the way you always hope a film will open : with so much energy and potential that the whole theater seems electrified . the scene is violent , profane , surprising and hilarious . as a tone-setter , it's marvelous ; as a stand-alone piece of writing and directing , it's hella-fun . filled with individual moments of loopy creativity , genuinely unsettling violence and wicked dialogue , the way of the gun should have been one of the best films of the year ( though in a painfully lackluster 2000 , it still has a shot at that dubious honor ) . the only reason it's not is a fundamental narrative miscalculation on mcquarrie's part : there's no good reason for parker and longbaugh to be the film's ostensible protagonists . for at least the first half-hour , the way of the gun is so skillfully rendered that it seems destined for glory . from parker and longbaugh's torment of a clerk at a sperm bank , to the unconventional staging of the kidnapping itself , to the splendid slow-speed chase that follows , mcquarrie twists the crime caper genre 90 degrees at virtually every opportunity . even playing the tarantino comparison card doesn't entirely do justice to mcquarrie's ability to throw a wrench into expectations . the connections between the characters become evident only after a bit of reflection ; there's no guarantee that bad-asses still won't get their bad asses kicked , or that those who appear likely to take the most punishment might not end up dishing it out . it's almost never exactly what you expect it to be . and , in at least one case , that's not exactly a compliment . mcquarrie , however , never seems aware of that fact . telling the story largely from their perspective isn't a celebration of the anti-hero ; it's a narrative blunder . is that blunder enough to throw the way of the gun entirely off course ? fortunately not . mcquarrie's compositions are unusually rich for a writer-turned-director -- watch for mrs . chidduck appearing in the background and at the edge of the frame -- yet he still ends on a kicker of a line of dialogue . the only thing missing from the way of the gun is soul , the soul that would have been provided by sarno as its center . it's a good film that's a 90 degree twist away from greatness -- the one 90 degree twist mcquarrie didn't take . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1704,"screenplay : john richards and james flamberg . director : neil labute . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , sexual situations ) running time : 110 minutes . there's something particularly delightful -- and subversive -- about a high-concept comedy that turns into something resonant . groundhog day could have been ridiculous and repetitive , but it charmed you with an unexpectedly touching romance ; being john malkovich could have been a simplistic tale of misguided celebrity worship , but it turned into an absurdist existential fantasy worthy of ionesco . hollywood excels at selling stories in a single sentence , and we come to expect that we know all there is to know about the film from that sentence . when it becomes evident that there's more to a film than its marketing-savvy premise , it's a heart-warming experience indeed . nurse betty isn't as thematically rich as either groundhog day or being john malkovich , and it's certainly not as thematically rich as director neil labute's dazzling debut in the company of men . it is , however , a peculiarly entertaining comedy that sticks in the brain for a while longer than you expect . it's entirely possible that nurse betty could have succeeded as a comedy strictly on the basis of its wild premise . labute directs with effective comic short-hand -- a scene portraying del in the middle of an affair with his secretary shows wear marks on the wall to emphasize his recidivist philandering -- and paces his showpiece sequences with a flair you might not expect from the misanthropic mind behind in the company of men . there are sharp visual gags like betty's perky look in her bloody nurse's outfit after performing an impromptu medical procedure , and slick exchanges of dialogue between charley and wesley . the performances are not uniformly appealing -- rock yells without doing much acting , and eckhart's mullet-headed lout of a husband is as broad a stereotype as you'll find - but the work by zellweger , freeman and kinnear more than takes up the slack . it's simply a funny comedy . simply funny , but far from simplistic . nurse betty takes the somewhat trite notion of soap operas as vicarious life for those with unhappy lives and twists it into provocative knots . the resolution may come to some obvious conclusions about the need to face reality , but along the way it shows a respect for the complexity of our coping mechanisms , whatever form they may take . with so much strong stuff at the center , it's a shame that nurse betty gets flabby around the edges . the attempts at entertainment industry satire don't always mesh with the edgier stuff , and the tone shifts from intense to playful on a dime . in fact , by all rights it should be just another affably mediocre piece of hollywood joke-mongering . yet even with its bumps and scrapes , nurse betty feels like more . there's something at stake , something recognizably human , something you don't often find in high-concept comedy . thanks to zellweger , freeman and ( of all people ) neil labute , there's a heart here , and a brain , too . it's an approach that takes a high concept just a bit higher . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1706,"screenplay : rod lurie . director : rod lurie . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 125 minutes . it's clear that lurie has a lot of interesting things say about contemporary american politics on a national level . it's equally clear that he still has a few things to learn about turning those things into smoothly satisfying film stories . questions regarding the pertinence of private life to public service have certainly been part of the political landscape in recent years , making the contender's subject matter timely food for thought . oldman makes for a superb antagonist as the cutthroat runyon , whose motivations are always swaying between genuine conviction that hanson isn't ready for the job and retribution for earlier political losses to the president . there are fine moments exploring the slippery slopes on which politicians walk in order to gain power , none more effective than a scene in which hanson -- armed with information that could allow her to make an effective personal attack on runyon -- is forced to decide whether or not to use it . the excruciatingly long silence in that scene says more about the tension between principle and expedience than any line of dialogue . that's also one of the few moments in the contender when lurie nails the timing of a scene . throughout the film , there's a sense that virtually every scene is about a minute too short , that virtually every character or sub-plot has been short-changed in some fashion . hanson herself remains enigmatic through much of the film , robbing the film of a real protagonist for the audience to embrace . and lurie sticks too closely to the insider wheelings and dealings , never venturing into the realm of public opinion to explore how scandals affect the public . the contender has the scope of an epic political drama without enough of the detail . fortunately for lurie , he scores several points for detail with jeff bridges' performance as president evans . plenty of actors have essayed portrayals of american presidents with an emphasis either on sheer authoritative presence or flawed humanity . bridges nails both , switching from genial charm to icy political determination in the blink of an eye . it's a near-perfect piece of film acting , capturing every one of a modern chief executive's many faces ; he even gives a kick to the obligatory climactic preachy-speechy . that's the only bit of greatness the contender can muster , however ; it's otherwise a merely solid piece of drama . perhaps next time around , rod lurie will pick up a few lessons from bridges on putting all the pieces together around a persuasive ideological core . such is the stuff of a great leader , whether behind the camera , or behind the desk in the oval office . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1707,"or it's a huge , sick joke at the audience's expense . or maybe it's both . you can't really put any motivation past lars von trier , a director whose fondness for rendering his own name in block letters four times larger than the film's title belies a certain streak of ego . this is a man who decided to write the rules for a new aesthetic of minimalist cinema with his dogme '95 manifesto , then proceeded to break all those rules by making a live-action musical . it has become clear that you can predict virtually nothing about the way von trier will try to make a movie , except that it will inspire extreme emotions . you may want to gasp , or cry , or smack him silly for dragging you along on his exercises in self-indulgence . only musicals can temporarily distract selma from her mission -- watching one in a movie theater , performing in one in a local theatrical production , or imagining that the world around her is turning into one when life gets particularly grim . the grimness of selma's life is rendered in von trier's favored washed-out morph of film and digital video -- big risk #1 -- but it's a tactical blunder for this particular script . dancer in the dark is fashioned as a melodrama , with developments that pit our morally pure heroine against dastardly forces . on glossy celluloid , such an old-fashioned narrative approach might have worked . the hand-held , documentary-style of dancer in the dark , however , demands a level of depth in the characters' motivations and relationships that isn't always there . that's time that could have been much better spent on the underdeveloped relationship between selma and gene , which should be central to the film . it would have been possible to turn selma's conflicted motivations into a compelling plot point . instead , it's still often dizzying , chilling and more engrossing than virtually any other film this year . big risk #2 was the casting of bjork as selma , and it's hard to do justice to how extraordinary her performance is . while her less-than-authentic czech accent occasionally distracts , she hits every emotional note with such resonance that it's painful to watch her . and as painful as it is to watch , it's equally impossible not to watch when big risk #3 -- the musical production numbers -- kicks in . they're rendered as brightly-colored interpretations of selma's interior life , inspired by the natural rhythms of a train's wheels , machinery and a record's run-out groove . undoubtedly some viewers will find it impossible to get past the contrivance , or past bjork's distinctive yodeling vocals . others will be transfixed by the image of a killer fantasizing the forgiveness of the victim , or the most abruptly concluded musical number in film history . many critics have already noted that dancer in the dark bears more than a passing resemblance to von trier's 1996 film breaking the waves in its focus on the trials of a beatific female martyr . indeed , selma's sacrifice is not set up nearly so convincingly as that of emily watson's bess , which can only make dancer seem to suffer by comparison . that doesn't diminish what von trier is able to accomplish this time around with another spectacular performance and more giddy disregard for expectations and conventions . dancer in the dark is a deeply flawed narrative that becomes a long sit during its third act ; it's also studded with several moments of jaw-dropping brilliance . it's the work of a director who'll do anything to inspire a reaction . in a world of overly sanitized cinema , it's hard to dismiss that kind of raw nerve . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1708,"directors : roger allers and rob minkoff . there is a yin to every yang , and if there is a down side to the remarkable success of disney's recent animated features , it's that the mouse keeps upping the ante for every subsequent feature . most likely . while not as emotional as beauty or as fast-paced as aladdin , the lion king is genuinely entertaining , with moments of truly stunning visual creativity . only weakness in the music and a fractured tone hamper the proceedings . like the last three big disney hits , the lion king is a musical , but it probably shouldn't have been . elton john and aladdin lyricist tim rice have provided five new songs , but nothing has the sparkle of the menken/ashman compositions , and for the most part the production numbers seem more obligatory than inspired . "" i just can't wait to be king "" is a silly , gaudy bit , and "" hakuna matata "" is a recycled "" bare necessities . "" it also features a chilling sequence with goose-stepping hyenas parading past scar against a subtle background with images of swastikas . hans zimmer's afro-tinged arrangements and incidental score make the most of the music , but the lion king is much more effective when the story is spoken rather than sung . the story is a somber one , an animated "" hamlet "" of sorts , and frequently the animation matches that tone . these sequences might be less than entrancing to the very young , but they are offset by lively , funny sequences featuring timon and pumbaa . nathan lane gives timon a bugs bunny cockiness which is charming , and ernie sabella is equally endearing as the affably flatulent warthog . nala's pursuit of pumbaa is the film's comic highlight , but the action in the lion king tends to be more serious . parents should exercise some judgment regarding taking children under six . none of this is to suggest that the lion king plods along humorlessly . timon and pumbaa get the most to work with , but they are ably assisted by the other supporting characters . scar , while sinister , gets of some dark one-liners ; robert guillaume has a small but goofy bit as a yoda-like baboon . as zasu , a hornbill who serves as mufasa's chancellor and simba's chaperone , he gets a fussy part that's a cross between the little mermaid's sebastian and beauty and the beast's cogsworth , but atkinson's droll delivery makes it his own ( and provides the single biggest laugh with a shot at one of disney's most annoying songs ) . the lion king is not a masterpiece ; it is too slow at times , and has perhaps too many characters to juggle . still , it is witty and beautifully drawn , and is sure to continue disney's amazing animated winning streak .

1709,"this just in : the sincere romantic drama is not extinct . make no mistake , it's on the endangered species list ; in this oh-so-ironic era , sincerity sightings have been akin to those blurry shots of the loch ness monster and hubcap-like flying saucers . you don't expect mainstream movies to deliver romantic stories that seem grounded in genuine feelings , and you certainly don't expect it from don roos , who wrote and directed the attitude-laden the opposite of sex . nevertheless , here comes bounce offering that rarest of y2k big-screen commodities : an adult relationship with some real emotion . it starts out , however , like a typical high-concept trifle . the surprise is that the relationship never feels like a wacky contrivance . roos is a smart writer with a nose for full characterizations , and the story development as a whole rarely feels manipulated for the convenience of the plot ( see below for notable exception ) . he steps back as a director from some of the most potentially exploitative moments , and injects his sharp wit in places where it works organically ( particularly in the person of johnny galecki as buddy's assistant ) . though it's a romance with some humor , it never ignores the basic sadness in both buddy and abby's lives that gives resonance to their connection . though it's a romance with tragic elements , it never wallows in the tragedy so much that it turns into melodrama . bounce could have been a true gem of a film if the leads had been more evenly matched as actors . gwyneth paltrow is one of those performers who appears doomed to be scorned and underappreciated for her talent as long as she is still young and attractive , but let's get this straight : she's a damned good actress . in bounce , she's once again wonderful , capturing abby's strength and vulnerability . affleck , on the other hand , still has some growing to do as an actor . he's not a bad actor , but he still carries himself on screen primarily with a swagger , even when he's supposed to be emotionally wounded . buddy the charming cad is a role affleck can make appealing in his sleep . not only does it once again place affleck in the unfortunate position of getting all mega-serious on us , it's also the only time bounce starts to feel like something that could only happen in a movie . there's nothing inherently wrong with romantic dramas that take on that an affair to remember-style sense of heightened tragedy . it's just so unusual when a film gives you the opportunity to explore romantic complications more simply . bounce makes it's share of mistakes , but it's always clear that its heart is in the right place . how refreshing to spend time with a film willing to show you its heart at all . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1710,"screenplay : m . night shyamalan . director : m . night shyamalan . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , violence , profanity ) running time : 107 minutes . [warning : the following review contains elements that may be considered plot spoilers . those who wish to see the film without any knowledge of plot developments beyond those contained in its trailers should not read this review . ] m . night shyamalan's unbreakable easily qualifies as the strangest , most subdued and most unconventional super-hero movie ever made . it will probably be considered something of a plot spoiler simply to make such a declaration , since shyamalan and touchstone pictures have made such a concerted effort to build a mystery around what exactly unbreakable is about . but there you have it : it's a super-hero movie . a moody , character-driven super-hero movie . with no costumes or action figures . no explosions . and no crash-cut editing . it's a super-hero movie as directed by m . night shyamalan , the anti-joel shumacher . in many ways , unbreakable's story is the quintessential modern super-hero story . what shyamalan does is wrap the archetypal mythology in psychology and family drama . he harbors long-suppressed unhappiness over the life he may have given up for his family , unhappiness willis generally conveys through the raspy whisper he uses in his serious dramatic actor mode . willis , jackson , penn and clark all play fully-developed characters , which makes unbreakable a rare enough film in that it's genuinely concerned not just with situations , but with people responding to situations . and yet it's still indisputably , undeniably a super-hero movie , though unlike any super-hero movie you've ever seen before . shyamalan's style is unusal for a director in any genre , one that favors long , unbroken takes over quick cuts and reversals . that style contributed greatly to the powerful aura of mystery in shyamalan's the sixth sense , and it contributes here to a sense of greater consequence than you'd expect from a tale of a super-powered man learning how to fight evil . the moment in which david and joseph jointly discover david's unusual strength is played with a light sense of humor and a truly under-stated sense of awe ; david's climactic encounter with a villain is shot in a way that makes heroic triumph surprisingly ugly . as visually gifted as shyamalan is as a filmmaker -- perhaps even showy in his way -- unbreakable never lets a special effect or a camera trick take over this narrative . unbreakable takes a couple of unfortunate wrong turns during its third act . the other involves a late plot development that's not nearly as organic to the story as the sixth sense's already-legendary twist . it feels almost obligatory , as though shyamalan were under the impression that it's what the audience expects from him now . that seems an unlikely prospect , though , considering how blithely he goes about blowing up every expectation you've ever had about a super-hero movie . unbreakable is a compelling , fundamentally sound story that feels more and more daring until its late stumbles . it's too bad that the final moments are so weak , because it might leave viewers doubting its other impressive accomplishments . this is a film that emerges from its own internal conflicts ultimately triumphant -- just like a strange , subdued , unconventional super-hero movie should . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1711,"since i began reviewing films , no film has left me as stumped as forrest gump . while i was watching , i was carried away , delighted by an original and stunningly executed experience . but almost as soon as the closing credits started to roll , i began to feel that something just wasn't working . forrest gump is , by turns , hilarious , overly precious , touching and disturbingly simplistic . so the question becomes , which forrest gump do i review : the in-the-theater experience , or the in-the-car experience ? the undeniably entertaining crowd-pleaser or the pre-digested primer in pop philosophy ? naturally , i found my answer somewhere in the middle . tom hanks plays the title character , an alabama naif with an iq of 75 but a heart of gold . there is little question that the craft of forrest gump is a wonder to behold . the digital wizards at ilm have triumphed again with the sequences placing forrest in footage with presidents kennedy , johnson and nixon , as well as george wallace and john lennon . perhaps even more impressive are the shots in which gary sinise is made to appear a double amputee . yet for all the notice- grabbing visuals , it was the sound that blew me away . one vietnam battle scene will shock you out of your seat , and the sound of a hurricane is equally stunning . this is not say that director robert zemeckis rests on his technical support . forrest gump never fails to be a feast for the senses . it's also frequently a feast for the funny bone , but unfortunately zemeckis succumbs to the same tendency that sometimes hampered who framed roger rabbit ? , namely a desire to throw in too many winking cultural asides . the biggest laughs are purely character moments , such as forrest discovering his speed while blowing apart his leg braces , or the rambling shrimp-based menu delivered by forrest's army buddy bubba . at a certain point , it's just overkill , and it detracts from the whimsical tone with its heavy-elbowed nudges . tom hanks' performance as forrest is problematic . while he avoids most of the one-note traps of dustin hoffman in rain man , he is still far too mannered , particularly when compared to the dynamic naturalistic performances of co-stars robin wright and gary sinise . wright delivers a wrenching performance worthy of high praise , and sinise may have found the role which makes him a household name ( if the stand didn't already do so ) . hanks may garner yet another academy award nomination , but he was better in a comparable role in big , and for my money even better in his much criticized performance in philadelphia . my biggest problem with forrest gump is that in its attempt to re-construct america's turbulent last thirty years , it has created a philosphical monster . gump has most often been compared to 1979's being there , but there is a critical difference . jerzy kozinski created a biting satire of how the platitudes of a dim-witted man became wisdom in a sound-bite society . there is no such distance in forrest gump ; forrest's bon mots * are * the film's philosophy , and as such they seem like truth mcnuggets . gump may be a paean to an innocence lost , but it is also troublingly anti-intellectual , history filtered through robert fulghum . these will not be the concerns of the average movie-goer , i'm certain . they will be more interested in the pure entertainment value of forrest gump's picaresque journey through life , and the film's emotion . gump will be many things to many people . to me , it was just another good but flawed movie .

"" wolf handled the theme much better , but it was a more stylish film in many ways . the mask is full of cookie-cutter small-time hoods better suited for comic relief than for any real villainy , which makes stanley's predicament much less interesting . in fact , it's probably safe to say that nothing in the mask would be at all interesting without its inventive visuals and jim carrey's rubbery mug . fortunately , the mask does have those elements , and they make for a dizzying ride . the computer graphics which turn carrey into a walking tex avery cartoon are delightful , granting him a lunatic arsenal of tricks . the most whimsical use of ilm magic might be the mask's effect on another cast member , stanley's scene-stealing dog milo , in a hilarious bit from the final showdown . special kudos also should go to the makeup team headed by greg cannom , which has managed the challenging task of making carrey's mask distinctly otherworldly without obscuring his malleable features . with so much technical wizardry flying around , it might be easy to overlook the art direction and set decoration , from stanley's apartment to the coco bongo club , all of which are perfectly in tune with the comic book atmosphere of the mask . then there is 1994's boy wonder , jim carrey , who turns in a performance so energetic it should probably be regulated . he goes robin williams' aladdin genie one better , using his own face and body as often as any cinematic chicanery to become a gallery of characters . he is the single best reason to see the mask , and he truly must be seen to be believed . surprisingly , he actually gets supporting help , particularly from peter riegert , effectively deadpan as the no-nonsense cop . there are flat spots , like the sluggish performance of richard jeni as stanley's friend and co-worker , and the aforementioned yawn-inducing villains . the bottom line is this : if you can appreciate the idea of a group of police officers involuntarily joining the mask in a performance of "" cuban pete , and if carrey doesn't make you cringe , the mask will fit you perfectly .

"" costume supervisor emily seresin deserves special kudos for the wild outfits which highlight the film ; particularly noteworthy is an impromptu performance of "" i will survive "" for an audience of aboriginals ( accompanied by digeridoo ) , and the big show at the resort featuring numerous gaudy costume changes . there is one truly unfortunate element in priscilla , and it really leaves a bad taste in the mouth . her character , and accompanying performance launching ping-pong balls from a portion of her anatomy , are truly unworthy of this film . but if you're willing to grit your teeth through her appearance , priscilla will prove to be a mostly delightful piece of entertainment , suprisingly wise and touching .

1714,"screenplay : warren beatty and robert towne . making an old-fashioned romance isn't as easy as it might look . while films from this year like it could happen to you and only you attempted to re-create the magic of bygone love stories , they succeeded primarily in creating cloying pseudo-parodies of what those classic stories were all about : that perfect someone appearing at the most improbable--and inconvenient--time . love affair does it right . warren beatty and annette bening have taken this third telling of a tear-jerking classic and made it a warm , sentimental and beautifully filmed experience , limited in its effectiveness only by beatty's somewhat wooden lead performance . if there is one unquestionable triumph to love affair , it is the atmosphere . there is a lyricism to his direction , without the force qualities of other recent romances . cinematographer conrad l . hall shoots in deep oranges and with lots of filters , and photographs bening in the loving style which used to be reserved for grace kelly or ingrid bergman . ennio morricone's sweet , simple score also contributes to a mood which inspires you to hold your date's hand a bit more tightly . this is not to say that love affair gets by on style points alone . at the top of the list is bening , beatty's real life better half , who shines as terry . few actresses in film can manage the kind of mature , intelligent appeal she brings to her roles , which makes it a shame that her appearances have been so infrequent of late . here she is both savvy and vulnerable , more than a match for beatty's aging playboy but still harboring basic insecurities . it's not a flashy role--love affair is not a flashy movie--but it's a fine performance . garry shandling is a delight as kip , mike gambril's agent , toning down his usual neurotic persona and giving a witty reading , and harold ramis has a funny cameo as an acerbic accountant . it's one of love affair's most significant failings that that same scene does more to explain beatty's character than beatty himself manages to do . this could have proved to be a fatal flaw , but there is just enough inherent romance in the situation that their pairing doesn't seem completely implausible . but the cathartic final scene is effective enough to make up for the melancholy tone of the final half hour . sentimentality is frequently a tough sell . love affair may be schmaltz , but it is artfully executed and well-acted schmaltz . and it renews my faith that somewhere , someone knows how to make a real love story .

1715,"screenplay/director : kevin smith . for the past few years , filmmakers have been trying to capture what it is that defines the generation which has thus far been difficult even to name . so-called "" generation x "" films like singles ; bodies , rest & motion ; and reality bites have tried , but their target audience seems to have rejected those attempts . at first glance , clerks appears to be cut from the same cloth , a bargain basement variation on tales of cynical , over-qualified and under-achieving whiners . made for a paltry $36 , 000 by writer/director kevin smith , clerks frequently shows its low-budget roots in performances which can charitably be called amateurish . brian o'halloran has an easy-going and engaging presence , but he's often far too broad in his physical acting . only lisa spoonhauer as the sexy and sharp caitlin puts much real spark into her performance . smith's direction is simple , but his insistence on swinging his camera back and forth in two-character scenes also proves distracting . like go fish earlier this year , clerks is occasionally just a bit too clunky to be completely endearing . the episodes which make up clerks are of inconsistent quality , but the good ones are very good . the dialogue is filled with ultra-crude observations which almost earned clerks an nc-17 rating , but they're caustic and on-target . randal in particular , who acts both as the devil on dante's shoulder and as the real voice of reason in clerks , gets some marvelous lines , though virtually every one of them is unprintable . less effective are sequences involving a roller hockey game on the store's roof which simply lasts too long , and a montage of annoying customer types which is a bit is too cutesy . but clerks turns out to be more than just the sum of its parts . kevin smith places himself in the awkward position of chastising those who are most likely to be his audience , and it is that daring that makes clerks most worthy of admiration ; it is not often that personal responsibility is the moral to a story . while he may not have had all the tools at his disposal that a studio filmmaker would have had to tell this story , kevin smith did have a story to tell . clerks is unquestionably uneven , but it is also a very funny wake-up call to the over-the-counter culture .

1716,"screenplay : john hughes and george seaton . director : les mayfield . let's leave aside for a moment the question of whether it was really * necessary * to make an updated version of the 1947 classic miracle on 34th street . it's the question that plagues every remake , often unfairly . while it may be rare to find a film done * better * the second time around , that doesn't necessarily mean that the remake might not be perfectly enjoyable on its own merits . and i believe that this is true in the case of this gentle fantasy . while it is nothing spectacular , it's genuinely touching , and feeds off a surprisingly strong current of spirituality . with the exception of some pratfall shenanigans at the parade early in the film , huges and director les mayfield avoid excess , keeping the story low-key and character based . the characters are not uniformly interesting , mind you . the love story between perkins and a too-good-to-be-true attorney ( dylan mcdermott ) is not well-developed , largely because perkins doesn't do too much with her role to show why such a perfect guy is interested in such a depressing woman . the villains are also pretty boring , and jane leeves ( daphne from tv's "" frasier "" ) in particular has nothing to do and even less to say as one of the rival store's operatives . however , it is the casting of actor/director richard attenborough as kriss kringle which helps the miracle happen . sure , he's no edmund gwenn , who won an academy award for his portrayal in the original , but attenborough is a warm and lively presence who is perfectly believable as an embodiment of human kindness without being * too * saintly . a scene in which he "" speaks "" to a deaf girl in sign language really put a lump in my throat , and there is a lot of genuine emotion in the film . doubtfire , who avoids overly-precocious traps while handling some tricky dialogue for a young actress . that conversation is part of a challenging theme in miracle on 34th street , and it brings us back to the question we started with : why remake this movie ? the answer can be found in the ways ( and occasionally none-too-subtle ones , it should be fairly noted ) that huges and mayfield use belief in santa claus as a metaphor for contemporary views on religious faith . the film asks whether the world is a better place for the erosion of faith , not because of some effect on "" values , "" but because of an effect on the human spirit ; it asks whether it is really a good thing to raise a child without faith . many viewers might not appreciate being confronted with these questions , but so few films ever dare to deal with the subject of faith that miracle on 34th street should be commended for trying . if it's not entirely successful , it's partly because robert prosky , as the judge presiding over the kriss kringle case , fumbles the speech which should emphasize this theme by making it far too animated when it should be pitched lower . the film's denouement is also somewhat too long , and doesn't maintain the spirit of the scenes with attenborough . but the important thing is that miracle on 34th street is a good family entertainment that takes a chance on being about something . and it made a believer out of me .

1717,"a few years ago , i saw a production of "" les miserables "" in san francisco , and i loved it . i loved the experience of being in that theater , and of giving myself over to the spectacle and the energy of that live performance . some time later , it occurred to me that if i had seen the identical production on a movie screen , i probably would have laughed myself silly at its bombast . only this : live theater and film are not the same animal , and what works in one does not necessarily work in the other . vanya on 42nd street is a great stage production , but as a film it is simply good . the framing device , which shows the cast members and director andre gregory walking down bustling new york streets towards the theater , is clearly intended to establish a relevance of vanya in the modern day . to the extent that it succeeds , that connection is really about living a life in the theater . from the moment when the actors imperceptibly begin the production with the line , "" your looks have faded , "" this vanya becomes a kind of purgation of the agonies of being an actor , and the characters come to represent very recognizable types . the years of rehearsal and refinement show in performances which are effortless almost to a one . however , perhaps the most wrenching performance belongs to brooke smith , who tears into sonya with an emotional ferocity few actors could muster . her two scenes with moore are powerfully played , and when she broke down i felt tears welling in my eyes . it is as good a performance by a supporting actress as you'll see this year . all these things vanya on 42nd street does exceedingly well , but while i was sitting in my seat watching it on a screen , i often felt more distanced than i should have felt . louis malle's choices in framing shots are not particularly inspired , and cinematographer declan quinn's camera teeters for no apparent reason , creating that verite vertigo pioneered by woody allen's husbands and wives . to put it bluntly , i couldn't quite figure out why this film had been made . i started to become annoyed that i couldn't be one of the lucky few who was able to see this production in the flesh , and i wondered why these actors who were obviously so dedicated to this play hadn't considered touring with it . vanya on 42nd street is a superior interpretation of a fantastic play , but i couldn't quite shake the conviction that i really should have seen it * on * 42nd street .

1718,"director : alan rudolph . the collection of authors , journalists and performers who gathered for lunches at new york's hotel algonquin in the 1920s are among those peculiarly american individuals who are perhaps more famous for being famous than for anything they actually said or did . there is a great historical disagreement as to who was there at any given time , to whom certain famous quotes should be attributed , and even whether those quotes were actually spoken . more than anything , they became symbolic of the kind of dissolute jazz age bon vivants immortalized by fitzgerald and hemingway . parker and the vicious circle , an uneven but still quite intriguing examination of the algonquin round table's most famous member . parker as it has ever been in rudolph's work . altman's trademark overlapping dialogue is particularly noteworthy , and it is one of rudolph's most questionable decisions . the round table was defined by the volleys of bon mots exchanged by its members , and while many clever lines come through , nearly as many are drowned out by other conversation . i often caught uproarious laughter in response to a joke i hadn't heard . rudolph uses the interactions of these individuals to demonstrate a superficiality which defined dorothy parker's world : everyone at the table was too busy trying to be clever to pay much attention to anything anyone else had to say . "" i write doo-dads , "" parker comments in one scene , "" because it's a doo-dad kind of town , "" and that remark speaks volumes about the round table regulars , and perhaps even the jazz age as a whole . as we watch parker slip deeper and deeper into depression , it becomes astonishing that none of her so-called friends , with the exception of benchley , ever seem to notice or care . leigh's performance is stunning , though she does affect a speech pattern that sounds like a gin-soaked variation on her stanwyck/hepburn bit from the hudsucker proxy , and she seemed to swallow many of her lines . it's a piece of work made all the more challenging by the odd structure of the script , which has leigh playing parker at several different phases of her life , as well as reading selections from parker's poetry directly to the camera . she manages to capture the soul of an extremely troubled survivor whose final line in the film ( "" i can't believe i made it "" ) is both comic and touching . her performance * is * mrs . parker , and through all of rudolph's fits and starts i found that i actually felt i had met dorothy parker .

1719,"starring : whoopi goldberg , mary-louise parker , drew barrymore . screenplay : don roos . i have nothing against that ever-growing sub-genre of american filmmaking known as the "" chick flick ; "" however , i do have a problem with the idea that women will flock to any slapdash attempt at a sob story , any muddled mess which happens to include female friends , mothers and daughters and truckloads of tragedy . hollywood knows a lot about how to market films to women , but it has done a pretty miserable job of making them . fortunately , boys on the side is that rare creation , an emotional film that actually takes the time to develop characters , although it goes a bit overboard in its third act . the first half of boys on the side is surprisingly funny and effective , thanks largely to three winning performances by goldberg , parker and barrymore . goldberg has coasted quite a bit lately , playing the same hipper-than-thou character with a perpetual furrow in her brow as she deals with dopey white folks , but she is quite good here . parker is a more subtle actress , and she has to be in a role that easily could have become a fussy stereotype ; instead , robin is an extremely sympathetic and appealing character . boys on the side is very funny , but there is more to it than that . in one early scene , robin sprays disinfectant on jane's headphones before using them , and goldberg gives us a "" you've got to be kidding "" reaction shot . but that moment takes on a different resonance when it is revealed that robin has aids , and might be taking basic precautions . similarly , it is a surprise when jane refuses to hold robin's hand after learning of her illness , since we expect a nearly divine level of understanding from gay characters , but that moment is complicated by the realization that jane might be falling for robin , and that pulling away is just a way of expressing her fear of those emotions . there are numerous surprises like that , both funny and touching , throughout the first half of boys on the side , but the second half is much more uneven . once the women stop in tuscon , much of the film's energy stops with them , and humor inevitably gives way to bathos . most frustrating is a murder sub-plot , which is largely unnecessary and symptomatic of screenwriter don roos' tendency to pile far too much into far too little time . this is a film about the friendships between these three women , and it seriously falters when those friendships are not the focus of the story . when they are the focus , boys on the side does exactly what it sets out to do : it makes you laugh , it makes you sad , and it makes you care .

1720,"quentin tarantino may prove to have a more profound effect on the immediate future of cinema than any other single individual . it's not just that other new filmmakers will be mimicking his style , though such recent fare as love and a . 45 shows that he is already having an influence in that respect . no , tarantino's most important legacy may be that films which until only recently would have seemed doomed to obscurity are finding enthusiastic distribution because the audience has spoken : dark , funny and twisted is * in * . the first beneficiary of the tarantino effect might be the british import shallow grave , a macabre little thriller with some shaky characterizations but a great look and feel . thrillers like shallow grave depend on tight plotting , tense situations and atmosphere , and it hits about two out of three . the point behind disposing of the body is somewhat lost on me , since they could have reported the death without reporting the money , and a few late developments are glossed over so quickly that it's easy for the audience to wonder exactly what happened when . but it is mostly in retrospect that these problems appear , because shallow grave is a pretty intense piece of work . a pair of interviews with a police detective are extremely effective , as you begin to watch the roommates' resolve crumble , and danny boyle's direction highlights a marvelous set , the massive flat shared by juliet , david and alex . the lighting , the bold colors and the seemingly endless hiding places create a mounting paranoia that sweeps you in even as it sweeps in the characters . yet for all its tension and eventual excursions into viscera , shallow grave is essentially a character piece that examines how the fragile relationships between these three individuals are shattered by their shared secret . unfortunately , the other two leads are not nearly as well developed . kerry fox is savvy and manipulative as juliet , but there is something missing , a bit too much left unsaid , particularly her refusal to deal with the men who call for her or approach her at social functions . while the story could have been about how their mutual participation in this event changes all three , it ends up that david is the only one whose state of mind is examined in any depth . still , shallow grave works fundamentally because it keeps the pressure on . it is always only a matter of time before a "" perfect crime "" is revealed in its imperfection , and the multiple double- crosses are fun to watch . though shallow grave could have been tighter and more psychological , eccleston's intense performance and a few nasty little twists make it a thriller that keeps you watching , guessing and squirming .

1721,"screenplay : andrew davies . director : pat o'connor . maybe it's just a matter of perception , but movies seem to come out in thematic waves . 1994 was widely noted as the year of the simpleton , with both dramas ( nell , forrest gump ) and comedies ( airheads , dumb and dumber ) focusing on those with social or intellectual handicaps . though it occasionally loses sight of its strongest elements , circle of friends is mostly a warm , charming and insightful little romance , buoyed by a delightful performance from fresh face minnie driver . minnie driver is enchanting as benny , a shining if unconventional beauty with a sharp mind and a keen sense of herself . her growth is thoroughly convincing because she neither begins nor ends as an extreme ; hers is a slow but noticeable growth from girl into woman . chris o'donnell's irish accent slips here and there , but mostly his is a very relaxed and confident performance as a pretty boy lacking in confidence . the primary problem with circle of friends is that when the story isn't focusing on benny , it is more melodramatic and far less enjoyable . too much time is spent on nan's carefully planned attempts to land a rich husband , and the rather melodramatic plot developments which accompany those attempts work against the simple believability of benny's story . saffron burrows is also rather dull as the beautiful nan , and for as much time as we spend with her character , her motivations are never really clear . the conflict between the three friends' catholic morality and their earthly desires is much more interesting than the somewhat contrived external conflicts , and generally more amusing besides .

1722,"screenplay : terry turner & bonnie turner . if there is a development in recent popular culture more depressing than the degeneration of "" saturday night live "" into a weekly televised car wreck , it is the proliferation of equally pungent big screen projects featuring current and alumni snl cast members . these films have primarily been wrong-headed attempts to turn a five minute sketch into a ninety-minute movie ( it's pat , coneheads ) or self-indulgent star vehicles for annoying stars ( opportunity knocks , billy madison ) . that is why it comes as such a complete shock that tommy boy is funny , and not just sporadically . it is an ideal vehicle for chris farley and david spade that falls flat only when it mistakenly tries to be warm and fuzzy . what separates tommy boy from other snl cast projects is that it looks like someone actually sat down and tried to figure out how chris farley and david spade could best be used . an hour and a half of nothing but farley's pratfalls and manic outbursts would have been intolerable ; ditto for spade's snottier-than-thou put-downs . indeed , both of their comic personae are very individual tastes , and those who are irritated by either or both of them might not find much to like in tommy boy . but for some reason , farley and spade complement each other very well : farley does something really stupid , and spade makes an acerbic comment . that's the basic formula , repeated with variations on the content and context . and most of the time , it's good for a solid laugh . that is largely because screenwriters terry and bonnie turner ( the brady bunch movie ) come up with some inspired situations within the routine plot . there are a few hilarious scenes of farley and spade bonding over cheesy songs on the radio , including the carpenters' "" superstar "" and the spanish language ballad "" eres tu . "" sure there are more than a few clunkers , as well as a completely unnecessary and un-funny scene centered around masturbation , but far more of the jokes are dead on . tommy boy's biggest lapses come when silly plot contrivances draw the focus away from the two stars . there is an obligatory romantic interest for farley in the woefully under-used julie warner as a spunky employee at callahan's , but it is about as tacked-on as a sub-plot could be . farley's villainous step-family is also pretty boring for the most part , although it is a kick to see bo derek again after over a decade , and rob lowe may have discovered a new career as a camp villain after this film and the first wayne's world . basically , any time the makers of tommy boy try too hard to be anything but funny , it doesn't work . when they try to be funny , it does .

1723,"director : jon turtletaub . when--and for that matter , why--did sleepless in seattle become the sine qua non for any critical blurb for a romantic comedy ? "" this year's sleepless in seattle ! "" actually , the "" why "" part is easy ; sleepless in seattle was a huge box office success and an easy point of reference for an idealized modern romance . while you were sleeping is already drawing comparisons to the 1993 hit with some basis , but not because bill pullman is in the cast or the word "" sleep "" is in the title . both funnier and more genuinely romantic than sleepless , while you were sleeping seems destined to be for sandra bullock what sleepless was for meg ryan : the vehicle that stamps her as one of the few genuinely bankable female stars in hollywood . in many ways , the recent film of which while you were sleeping reminded me most was not sleepless in seattle , but groundhog day . it has a paper-thin , high-concept premise which at any moment could have collapsed under the weight of its contrivances . but it never quite happens ; just when you expect the script to go in a predictable direction , it doesn't . writers daniel g . sullivan and fredric lebow don't load the story with awkward little situations that lucy gets out of by sheer coincidence ( although naturally there are a few ) , nor do they resort to farce or slapstick . in one particularly engaging scene around a boisterous dinner table , while you were sleeping becomes more than its easily-summarized plot point . it also boasts a winning performance by sandra bullock and an impressive chemistry between bullock and bill pullman . with her wholesome beauty and radiant smile , bullock is perfectly cast as lucy . it is not a particularly complex character , but bullock has real grace as a comic performer , an under-appreciated skill evident in far too few current screen stars . he does not have conventional leading man looks , but there is an appealing self-deprecation in his manner which could make him a natural romantic lead . there are suggestions throughout the film that he's going to turn out to be a truly narcissistic jerk , but we never get a chance to see that character . peter gallagher ends up playing peter as mostly befuddled , and not very interesting . there is also a throwaway sub-plot involving peter's hell-on-wheels _real_ fiancee , who is not given a chance to do much of anything . the final twenty minutes of the film become mostly a waiting game until lucy and jack end up together , and one that drags on a bit too long . but it's what goes on while peter is sleeping--a bright , charming romance--that makes while you were sleeping a pleasant dream .

1724,"starring : dylan mcdermott , nancy travis , james legros , jim belushi , quentin tarantino . screenplay : robert ramsey and matthew stone . director : jack baran . adventurous young screenwriters and filmmakers often have to walk a very fine line between originality and approachability . those seeking financing from sources like the sundance institute are trying to win people over with a creative spirit , but a different aesthetic is frequently required if the film is lucky enough to make it into the marketplace . destiny turns on the radio has already been branded with the financially toxic label of "" cult film , "" and it is true that its tone bears more than a passing resemblance to films like repo man and wild at heart . but there's more than that to destiny . although it is wild and quirky , occasionally to excess , it is also surprisingly entertaining and grounded in real emotion by an exceptional performance from nancy travis . it would be foolish to suggest that the first thing one would notice about destiny turns on the radio would be anything but it's rather off-center characteristics . a motel with rooms named after marilyn monroe films , a shared dream which results in a pregnancy and an electrified swimming pool which acts as a gateway to another reality are not exactly the stuff of your average multiplex picture . there are occasions when those elements come perilously close to overkill , or indeed topple into overkill , but they are rare . the main reason screenwriters robert ramsey and matthew stone and director jack baran succeed is that most of the strangeness comes from the characters , and they are well-developed and well-performed almost to a one . only quentin tarantino , who should be declared legally charisma-impaired , bombs in his role . that's a problem , because johnny destiny requires _presence_ , not just attitude . las vegas becomes a kind of character in the film , a real-life mirage of false hopes . it is an intriguing character , wonderfully played by an actress who has been stuck too often in minor roles in bad films like greedy . and it's a shame that too many viewers won't see her performance because of the strange story surrounding her . destiny turns on the radio is aimed at those with a taste for the surreal , but it also has a very real heart which makes it more than the sum of its parts .

1725,"if you're looking for a textbook example of counter-programming , you would have to say that mgm's release of moll flanders qualifies . . . either that , or a textbook example of complete stupidity . june is supposed to be the exclusive domain of sequels , special effects and super-stars ; films based on period novels are not supposed to appear until the kids are back in school , the leaves have changed colors and the air is heady with oscar talk . nevertheless , here we have a romance with english accents taking on cruise , connery and carrey . it's a risky move , but one which could pay off , because moll flanders is a solid drama with a top-notch cast , and gives robin wright a break-out role to show off her talents . pen densham oversees a marvelous look for the production of moll flanders , and that look helps to make a fitful first half easier to take . the greatest charms in that first half are provided by freeman and corcoran , who share some frisky scenes as the no-nonsense manservant and his mischievous charge ; those scenes provide welcome comic relief . making your way through moll flanders can be like the experience of reading the novel in a high school english class -- the early exposition can lose you before you get to the meat of the story . i would hope that such is not the case , because moll flanders becomes an extremely effective and satisfying love story , and because even in that sluggish first hour robin wright turns in a wonderful performance . despite her delicate features , wright can make herself appear amazingly solid and determined , and that is a critical facet of the personality she is trying to convey . there is a completely natural chemistry between them , and their relationship makes the second half of moll flanders something special . densham's erratic sense of pacing does undercut the love story somewhat , as moll flanders never quite achieves the big , cathartic emotional moments one expects from a story of this kind . i think that he also doesn't allow freeman or stockard channing to do the best work of which they are capable . freeman may be the best american screen actor of the moment , but he never quite finds the character of the emotionally enslaved hibble , and channing similarly wavers between a kind of one-dimensional victorian villainy and a kinder , gentler side . what really makes moll flanders work , in a way that the recent jane eyre didn't , is that densham maintains a fundamental sense of optimism and energy , relegating the sense of loss and foreboding which could have dominated the story to a secondary status . moll flanders is a redemption story , and it is an effective one . it is also a human story , and that alone may help it to stand out while every theater around it reverberates with tornadoes and explosions .

1726,"screenplay : david sheffield , barry w . blaustein , tom shadyac , steve oedekerk . director : tom shadyac . if you ask most movie stars whether a given project is a "" comeback , "" they would probably insist that they were never away . in the case of eddie murphy , that's actually pretty close to the truth . _you_ may not have seen harlem nights , or the distinguished gentleman , or boomerang , or even beverly hills cop iii , but someone did -- over $300 million worth of someones , in fact . so no , eddie murphy never went anywhere ; it was only his ability to make people laugh which took a long vacation . i was beginning to wonder whether there was any of the old spark left in murphy , and then along comes the nutty professor . he still might have trouble identifying a decent script , but his talent is in full flower , including an unexpectedly broad acting range . murphy plays sherman klump , a brilliant chemistry professor with a bit of a weight problem -- about 400 lbs . worth . the result is a startling transformation of sherman klump into buddy love , a lean , mean testosterone machine who is every bit the party animal sherman never was . the lion's share of the pleasures in the nutty professor are pure eddie murphy , but not necessarily eddie murphy the way you are accustomed to seeing him . there are some big laughs in those family dinner scenes , particularly an extraordinarily embarrassing dinner with carla in attendance , although the flatulence gags are piled on a bit thick . but murphy is not coasting on his street-wise motor-mouth persona here , the persona which often seemed to be the only reason for dud projects like the golden child or the distinguished gentleman to exist . if anything , the nutty professor is a chance to poke fun at that persona through the hyper-slick buddy love . buddy is the arrogant , self-absorbed misogynist everyone probably believes murphy really is , and he knows enough to tweak that image for all he's worth . the real surprise is watching murphy sink his teeth into a real character , and do some real acting . murphy brings out that side as something endearing , and makes his shy , self-effacing manner terrifically appealing . i never thought i would see the day when eddie murphy would play a character who inspired sympathy , but watching klump disintegrate before a barrage of the comedian's barbs is genuinely poignant . murphy is so good that it's too bad he doesn't have better material to work with , or a more supportive supporting cast . for the most part , the script is all set-up with few truly inspired comic situations , relying on absurdist dream sequences and special effects for the big gags . there are moments when buddy love is on screen that you are waiting for murphy to run to the extreme , and ace ventura director tom shadyac just seems to be waiting for him to do something wacky . the script doesn't really give him the best opportunities , though , and he is playing off undeserving foils in jada pinkett and an uncomfortably edgy larry miller . murphy is trying to show what he can do here , and he is given material like the overly obvious homily at the film's conclusion which doesn't show trust in his abilities to convey emotion without spelling it all out . those abilities turn out to be what makes the nutty professor so much fun . welcome back , eddie , even if you never went away .

1727,"director : edward zwick . akira kurosawa's classic film rashomon may be the definitive cinematic text for film critics , because no film may work better at keeping us honest . the story of an assault seen through the eyes of four different individuals is about the subjectivity of reality , how perception creates "" truth , "" and every time i think about rashomon it makes me structure my arguments with care , and with an eye to my own subjectivity . i was thinking about rashomon quite a bit as i watched courage under fire , and not just because it is about conflicting accounts of a single event . throughout the film , i found my perspective shifting , my opinion rising and falling to the point where i realized that i was responding to courage under fire in pieces , and not as a whole . that response was at least in part the result of the kind of film courage under fire is , the kind of ambitious , sprawling drama which director edward zwick ( glory , legends of the fall ) has favored since his television days as co-creator of "" thirtysomething . "" reaction #1 : edward zwick is turning into a marvelous director of battle scenes . in glory , legends , and now in courage under fire , he captures the feel of war with a chaotic poetry , vistas of destruction which are nevertheless spectacular to behold . perhaps more impressive , zwick has accomplished something that the news was never able to accomplish , namely to drive home the fact that the gulf war was not a video game or a casual police activity like rousting a wino off a park bench with a baton . it was a war , and courage under fire does justice to the sacrifices of its participants . for a very long time , it is not clear what courage under fire is really about . is it a war-time tale of the terrors of the trenches ? is it a sort of mystery , where the real story of walden's actions will provide the payoff ? it takes forever for duncan to clarify what all of these stories have to do with one another , but by then they don't provide the layers of emotional resonance he was aiming for ; mainly , they provide confusion . there are too many conflicts in courage under fire , blunting the impact of the one which should have stirred the audience . reaction #3 : meg ryan really does have some dramatic chops . in previous serious efforts like when a man loves a woman and restoration , i found it difficult to buy ryan in a role which strayed from her quirky comic ingenues . washington is a tremendous actor , and he does some excellent work in courage under fire , but there are moments when the intelligence and confidence he almost always projects just don't seem appropriate . serling has moments of real despair and confusion , and washington doesn't always bring those qualities across . reaction #5 : courage under fire comes through with an emotional conclusion , and features some great supporting performances ( particularly matt damon as the medic in walden's crew ) . it is the kind of film which satisfies even as it leaves you suspecting that the scope should have been narrowed . courage under fire is a film which looks better from the back than the front , and a bit thick around the middle -- it's a different experience from different angles .

1728,"starring : michael keaton , andie macdowell , richard masur , john delancie , eugene levy , harris yulin . screenplay : chris miller , mary hale , lowell ganz , babaloo mandel , harold ramis . director : harold ramis . there have been many instances where my positive reaction to a film has been as much a result of what it _wasn't_ as what it was , and groundhog day may be the perfect example . on paper , it was a high-concept premise with nowhere to go , an over-extended "" twilight zone "" episode with a laugh-track . there didn't appear to be any way to make an infinitely repeated day anything but infinitely repetitious , but director/co-writer harold ramis and co-writer danny rubin startled me with a comedy of improbable inventiveness and even more improbable resonance . multiplicity , ramis' latest project , arrives with many of the same warning signs , and again it stays fresher through its running time than you might expect . this time , however , the comedy is as instantly disposable as it is enjoyable . almost no time to enjoy any of them . but even two doug kinneys doesn't seem to be enough , and when doug #3 enters the picture , the opportunities for disaster multiply right along with him . in a way that groundhog day never was , multiplicity really is a gimmick film . multiplicity is always about the farce of several doug kinneys getting each other into trouble , and the fact that it works so well and so often shows how artfully ramis is able to execute that farce . the comedy gets rather broad with doug #4 , the "" copy of a copy "" who turns out to be "" special , but the situations are great showcases for those characters , and keaton does some good work considering he is often working with no one but himself . multiplicity is a very funny film , full of clever touches like the character of a blissfully incompetent sub-contractor played by eugene levy and a housing development called "" vista del nada "" ( view of nothing ) , and it's easy to keep smiling through most of its 110 minutes . unfortunately , its attempts at a message get rather muddled . contributing screenwriters lowell ganz and babaloo mandel ( city slickers , forget paris ) have a tendency to paint emotional situations in extremely broad strokes , and that leads to some rather forced conflicts between doug and laura . andie macdowell , who was so good in groundhog day , doesn't have the chance to make an impression here ; her character is a necessity , not an individual . there are a number of rough edges in multiplicity ( including the excessively grainy special effects photography by richard edlund which allow the four dougs to interact ) , and they are mostly the result of an attempt to be the kind of film groundhog day was : a laugh-out-loud comedy which also managed to be about something warm and human . that kind of film is a rarity indeed , and it is no sin to have aspirations to that kind of completeness . in multiplicity , one laugh usually turns into another .

1729,"screenplay : akiva goldsman . director : joel schumacher . those suggestions should be absurd , but the way warner bros . is pushing john grisham's anointed one , they're merely the next logical step . it's one thing to be the flavor of the month , but mcconaughey has become the flavor of next month , a star without a previous starring role . that's a rather unfair burden to place on an actor , but now that a time to kill is finally here , it looks like the talent is up to the hype . leading an exceptional cast , matthew mcconaughey helps create some riveting moments in an occasionally melodramatic story . white supremacists are the nazis of the 90s ; film makers love them because they know we love to hate them , and because they don't have to worry about anyone protesting if they are portrayed as hissable cartoons . there are plenty of complex issues involved in the story of a time to kill , foremost among them the criminal justice system's entrenched racial inequities , but director joel schumacher and his frequent screenwriting collaborator akiva goldsman can't resist the impulse to be crowd-pleasers , providing plenty of moments for audience members to applaud klansmen being beaten , spit upon , arrested or otherwise mocked , all underscored by elliot goldenthal's strident strings . it is too bad that a time to kill needed the sneering evil and repetitive cruelty of overt racists like sutherland's character , and even the poorly developed sub-plot involving the involvement of the naacp , because it is so much better at exploring its more three-dimensional characters . a time to kill is exceedingly well cast , and the performances sparkle . he is being compared to everyone from paul newman to marlon brando to kevin costner , but none of those comparisons really does justice to his unique appeal . there is an absolute ease to his acting which you almost never see in actors his age ( mcconaughey is a ripe old 26 ) , along with a screen presence you rarely see in actors of any age . and in a film which features a few too many loud and obvious scenes , mcconaughey is absolutely electrifying in a scene which is emotionally crippling in its quiet power : jake describing the rape of carl lee's daughter to the jury in graphic detail . it is almost possible to accept that spacey's savvy prosecutor doesn't object to the obviously inflammatory remarks . perhaps he , like us , was simply transfixed by witnessing the birth of a star .

1730,"screenplay : nicole holofcener . director : nicole holofcener . walking and talking is the kind of film men generally see only if dragged by their wives or girlfriends . they react much the same way a male character in walking and talking does when he refers to the acoustic guitar tunes preferred by his fiancee as "" vagina music ; "" by that definition , this would certainly be a "" vagina film . "" with recent flops like now and then and moonlight and valentino giving films about female friendships a rather bad name , it might be easy to dismiss walking and talking sight unseen . but for what it's worth , writer/director nicole holofcener puts a woody allen spin on the genre , making her debut feature a quirky neurotic comedy in which appealing performances help counteract a lack of substance . walking and talking seems to have two major themes working at the same time . on the one hand , it is about the romantic relationship of our two heroines , and it provides some clever and amusing insights . holofcener makes her characters sexual beings without having it be part of the joke that a woman is a sexual being , the way it happens in many films written by men , and there is an impressive ease to the way in which she portrays men and women who are comfortable with each other . one such scene finds laura and frank beginning a casual shoving match in an elevator which turns into a playful war , and it is typical of the economy with which holofcener establishes the dynamics of her characters' relationships . there are plenty of signifiers which show us how significant this friendship is -- an opening scene of laura and amelia as pre-teens reading "" the joy of sex , "" the illness of the cat they shared when they were roommates -- but the signifiers don't take the place of effective scenes between them . it is true that the problem between the two is that they don't spend much time together any more , but we don't get enough opportunities to see their friendship at its best so that we can feel a sense of loss over their friendship at its worst . walking and talking is not exactly meaty fare in either of its two main themes , but what sells the film is its frisky tone and a cast which downplays the angst . catherine keener ( who was the insecure ingenue in living in oblivion ) is a delight as amelia , and keeps her borderline obsessiveness from becoming either pathetic or disturbing . it's a funny and sad performance as a woman having difficulty differentiating between needing and needy . keener has an ability to connect with other actors , to really seem to be listening , and that makes for some priceless interactions . anne heche is a weaker link in a weaker role ; her laura's predicaments never seem as urgent to her or to us . nicole holofcener's script might be a bit talky , but the talk is sharp and the talkers even sharper . forget labels like "" chick film .

1731,"screenplay : edward tang , fibe ma , lee wai yee . imagine a country where few people had ever seen an arnold schwarzenegger film ( it's hypothetical , work with me here ) . imagine that eraser was the first of his films to get a wide release there , and that it became a moderate success . supercop has the same high-flying action as rumble , a much stronger story , a bit less of a sense of absurd fun , and presents the distraction of terrible dubbing . supercop is actually the third film in the popular police story series , but that is almost as relevant to the story as it was when steven seagal did under siege 2 . jackie chan , for the most part , is about a persona , not a character . his goofy grins and self-deprecating manner make him a uniquely likeable action hero , and his ability to get out of impossible situations often seems as much a product of resourcefulness as sheer physical ability . chan's sense of humor is such an asset that it is unfortunate supercop doesn't integrate it into the story very smoothly . in many ways , supercop is a straightforward formula action film of the kind we tend to see a lot of in america , with evil drug lords , can-you-top-this stunts and a minimum of distracting characterization . rumble in the bronx may have been silly , but it was silly start to finish , and chan's fight sequences were part of the humor . supercop feels more divided , half jackie chan the action hero and half jackie chan the clown . to give supercop its due , there are some significant ways in which it is more than a typical american action film , and nowhere is that more evident than in the presence of michelle khan ( michelle yeoh to her hong kong fans ) . capable female action stars are a non-entity in hollywood , but khan packs a wallop both literally and in her screen presence . she also gets two of supercop's best stunts -- a leap onto a moving truck , and a motorcycle jump onto a train -- providing just some of the thrilling action moments typical of chan's films . it is also a lean and mean 85 minutes ; american action directors could take a lesson in efficient editing . action has always translated well on an international level , which makes it all the more annoying when making a film like supercop acceptable to american viewers requires dubbing which seems to have been recorded in a tin outhouse ( although a theme song by devo is almost as baffling ) . if miramax is serious about making chan's films an american staple , they should consider investing in some decent sound mixing . solid efforts like supercop will continue to build jackie chan's audience ; now it's time to bring on the big guns .

1732,"screenplay : robert altman , frank barhydt . director : robert altman . for the most part , however , those were risks in subject matter . in kansas city , altman structures his narrative like an improvisational jazz solo , with a payoff in the final ten minutes that is a real kicker . the question is whether he will have lost his audience in the 100 minutes of riffes which precede it . the product of those elements is a fusion of music , mood and plot in which the latter often gets short shrift . altman has one of his typically large casts to keep track of , and his shifts back and forth between them seem to have little to do with pacing . those speeches are far from riveting -- once you get the point that he is "" seldom seen and often heard , "" seldom's sociological observations simply serve to stall kansas city . for a long time , it seems to be just another example of the kind of film i criticized manny & lo for being , a hostage drama in which captor and captive predictably become friends . then , just as i was prepared to give kansas city up for dead , it assaulted me with developments so unexpected that they left me breathless . suddenly , a performance by jennifer jason leigh which had seemed like just another one of her mannered stabs at imitating 1930s screen actresses made beautiful , terrible sense ; suddenly , miranda richardson's opium-addled society dame was even funnier and more tragic ; suddenly , the johnny who had been little more than a piece of furniture during seldom's speeches came to life . kansas city's tale of brutal truths beneath glossy surfaces is the polar opposite of most of this summer's fare : it is a film which works far better when you are thinking about it afterwards than it does while you are watching it . i only hope audiences are willing to trust altman the risk-taker as long as it takes . "
1733,"there is nothing that will make a hollywood marketing executive salivate like a current news story to which a new film can be linked , and if you remember the bounce the china syndrome got from the three mile island accident of 1979 , you'll understand why . when a seven-state power failure hit the american west on august 10th , the folks at gramercy must have done the mipos dance of joy -- five days later , i had press material for the blackout thriller the trigger effect mentioning the august 10th failure . it's hard to resist that kind of "" torn-from-today's-headlines "" marketing , but i hope they don't make the trigger effect look like a cheap knock-off by overdoing it , because it is nothing of the kind . this is a sharp and surprisingly effective thriller which makes up for a sluggish middle with an exceptional start and finish . it is a smart and subtle piece of film-making which underlines the main premise of the trigger effect : how fragile a foundation it is on which civilization is based . it is amazing how much more obvious the ineptitude of the island of dr . moreau becomes when compared to a film which takes a very similar theme -- what separates us from animals -- and does it so much better . he tries to connect those troubles to the film's central themes -- annie has a problem respecting the mild-mannered matt until he steals medicine for the baby -- and he is successful for a little while . whatever point koepp might have been trying to make about the attraction of "" animal behavior "" gets muddled in the house-bound middle third of the trigger effect . koepp is not a genius at creating shaded characters ( remember , he _did_ write jurassic park and mission : impossible ) , but he demonstrates an impressive talent for building tension and for pacing a thriller to keep his audience involved . it is also noteworthy that koepp never makes a point of explaining what caused the blackout , because that would have been sending the wrong message about what mattered about this story . the trigger effect is a disturbing and all-too-real tale which makes the ironic observation that we have come to depend on technology for our humanity , and if a little creative marketing will bring people out to see it , then so be it .

1734," the dialogue .  "" the dialogue . "" "" what about the dialogue ? "" "" nothing , i'm just talking . "" "" i know you're talking , but what the * * * * are you saying ? "" just this : because it is so easy to get caught up in david mamet's distinctive brand of rat-a-tat , profanity-laden dialogue , it is even easier not to notice that he may be one of america's most deeply humanist playwrights . oleanna , for all its incendiary subject matter , had its foundations in a frustration over societal impediments to communication ; glengarry glen ross showed the business world hammering people into the ground . the twenty year old american buffalo was one of mamet's first plays , and it retains the ferocity of youth in its film incarnation , a set-bound but affecting study of trust and the lack thereof . it is a challenge to make a play work on the screen , particularly if the play is as dialogue-heavy as a david mamet play , and director michael corrente ( federal hill ) seems content to follow the lead of film versions of oleanna and glengarry glen ross by refusing to "" open up "" the action . american buffalo takes place almost entirely in one location -- don's store -- and there are times when the production begins to feel very cramped and oppressive . it is a bleak tale filmed in bleak tones , but corrente retains a necessary urgency . he also has two sensational lead actors and one up-and-comer to play the key roles , and they make american buffalo even more compelling . hoffman brings to the role the dissolute swagger of ratso rizzo , and while that makes the characterization familiar , it doesn't make it any less intriguing . there is a slight weak link in sean nelson , who made an electrifying debut in 1994's fresh but appears to have grown more self-conscious ; he clearly never quite gets a handle on mamet-speak . still , when the three actors share the climactic final scene , they refuse to surrender your attention . mamet is very much an acquired taste , and the taste of buffalo will be unappetizing to many . as a film , american buffalo is not spectacular , but it brings a great play to a wider audience , and that alone makes it noteworthy . those who might find it too pessimistic should think of it instead as a plea for a society where we can trust again , as mamet's raging attack on a world where civilization hangs by a thread and where friendship isn't worth a nickel .

1735,"screenplay : allison anders . director : allison anders . running time : 115 minutes . i have this idea that what happened to grace of my heart -- a good movie which flirts with being a great one -- is that allison anders wrote herself into a corner . grace of my heart has a superb character study at its core , made even more appealing by the top-notch work of illeana douglas , and that makes it a disappointment that allison anders has surrounded that character with so many elements which draw attention away from her . on one level , grace of my heart operates simply as a travelogue through an era in american popular music , and there are some extremely entertaining moments integrated into that travelogue . yet there are moments when the setting and the inspired-by characters feel forced . anders draws too much attention to supporting players by asking you to chuckle at what she is able to suggest about gore , phil spector and others without actually saying so , and it becomes a tail which wags the dog . dillon's performance is too sleepy to be involving even as jay becomes more and more paranoid and depressed , and we are left to watch him play the way wilson might have been without understanding why we should care . it is a long , patience-testing episode , and it is particularly frustrating coming at the tail end of a string of relationship episodes in which denise falls hard for a guy who turns out to be more trouble than he is worth . still , i was generally willing to indulge anders , because i could see where it all was leading . illeana douglas is fantastic as a woman who is both strong and weak , and her unique looks somehow make her even more believable as someone forced to linger in the background longer than her talent warrants . i wanted to stick with her through her story , and it remained worth the effort even after anders gets sidetracked . grace of my heart is a film with built-in flaws , but they can be overlooked for a chance to watch a woman find the grace in her own heart . "
1736,"whenever i hear an actor talk about needing to "" stretch , "" i generally feel the need to stretch my legs very far in the opposite direction . i do not mean to suggest that actors are not artists who seek out new challenges . it is simply that those who usually make the biggest noise about moving beyond one type of role in which they have been successful are also those who have lingered in that one role for a very good reason . hugh grant had become so familiar as a stammering , self-effacing light comedian that one would be forgiven for suspecting that was all he had in him . as evidence to the contrary , witness extreme measures , a solid hollywood thriller in which grant takes to the role of suspense hero like a producer to a sequel . as a rule , the hollywood suspense thrillers of recent years have been a rather sorry lot , and i believe that one of the reasons has been that constant attempts to shock are being substituted for the creation of mounting tension . director michael apted has made some of the more intriguing character-based suspense yarns of recent years ( thunderheart , blink ) , and extreme measures has a way of getting under your skin . it is an exceptionally well-paced film , with guy's dilemma growing incrementally ; its effect is based on watching guy get deeper and deeper in trouble , rather than watching him hurtle from one life-threatening confrontation to the next . there is also at least one completely unexpected turn which seems to put guy in an impossible situation , and a fight in an elevator which might truly bring you to the edge of your seat . grant is exceptionally convincing as an er surgeon , approaching every crisis with a matter-of-fact professionalism and confidence . it is tempting to play such characters as arrogant , and in the case of extreme measures it would be even more tempting so that the story could be based around a lesson about playing god . but guy is simply a scientist whose basic curiosity gets him into a completely unexpected mess , and there is such a consistency to grant's performance that his comic and dramatic moments merge seamlessly . it is an eye-opening piece of acting , and all the more challenging because grant has to carry nearly every scene . if there is one major frustration in extreme measures , it is that apted and screenwriter tony gilroy don't handle the conspiracy at its center very well . it is obvious what is going on far too early , particularly if you have seen any of the trailers which essentially give everything away . that detracts from the process of discovery , and might make you impatient as you simply wait for guy to figure out what you have known for over an hour . the conclusion tries to shove far too much into far too little time -- a physical showdown ; the outlining of a moral dilemma ; the attempt to flesh out hackman's role , which is really a glorified cameo -- resulting in a thriller which sags exactly when it should be peaking . it is fortunate that the preceding ninety minutes is so energetic and involving . it is even more fortunate that hugh grant is so well-suited to his role , and that it proves not to be such a stretch to think of him in a lab coat rather than just a morning coat . "
1737,"tom hanks is a nice guy , the guy everyone in hollywood likes , so you figure that he didn't get his first gig as a writer/director by demanding it . not that he would need to -- getting on the good side of one of the most bankable good guys in movies is a pretty smart business move , so someone was going to give him a shot . it could only be a fringe benefit for fox if hanks' debut effort turned out to be a good film or a successful one , and it is entirely possible that they may have gotten both . that thing you do ! is a nice movie , and one which a lot of people are going to like , even if it falls apart at its conclusion . that thing you do ! naturally , success proves to be more complicated than the wonders expect . there are plenty of places hanks could have chosen to take the conflict in that thing you do ! -- guy's father resisting his son's music career , the deposed drummer growing bitter over missing the boat -- but by the time we reach a scene in which both dad and drummer are gleefully enjoying the wonders' success it has become clear that hanks is not interested in that kind of melodrama . that thing you do ! is intended almost entirely as a playful romp , and for quite a while it succeeds . that thing you do ! does a fine job of capturing the exhilaration of newborn celebrity , nowhere better than in a wonderfully crafted sequence where the band members hear their song on the radio for the first time . with so many films about real-life rock and roll stars focused on the destructive nature of fame , it is a welcome change of pace to find one which makes fame seem like so much fun . there is at least an attempt to foreshadow jimmy's ambivalence over the band's success , but he is such a bland character compared to his bandmates that he barely even registers as relevant . though it had been little more than wallpaper for most of the film , it suddenly becomes the defining crisis , and you are likely to wonder if you missed something when faye goes into a tearful denunciation of jimmy's inattentiveness . hanks doesn't seem to know how he wants to end the story , except that he wants it to end happily , and the effortless good humor of that thing you do ! the strange thing is that even though hanks bungles the big moments , he does so many things right with the small moments that it is easy to walk away with a smile , beginning with a great title song which actually seems to deserve to be a hit . scenes at a rock and roll show ( with kevin pollak as a catch phrase-prone disc jockey/promoter ) and a tv variety show capture the glorious phoniness of early 60s show-biz , and hanks evokes help ! -era hanks himself does solid work in the role of the all-business white , proving he's still a much better actor than he is a director , and a considerably better director than he is a writer . that thing you do ! is clumsy but lovable , the work of a nice guy who is far from finishing last as a film-maker , even if he has a way to go before finishing first . "
1738,"it's tough to find a fresh angle when you're making a movie about 20-somethings and their relationships in 1996 , since the last five years have seen such a glut of such films that you couldn't throw a rock without hitting one . young film-makers may be attempting to follow the creative writing 101 dictum of "" write what you know , "" but in so doing they are writing what we all have seen enough of by now to know even better than they do . swingers appears at first glance to be more of the same , but it's not really a relationship film . instead , screenwriter jon favreau has created what amounts to a comedy with a national geographic twist , a charming , almost documentary account of the habits of the north american human male in the wild . director doug liman seems to be working hard to create a sense of place ; in fact , he sometimes seems to be working a bit too hard . the authenticity liman is going for with those locations is an authenticity specific to the time and place where swingers is set , and that is fine , but it is much more winning in its authentic portrayal of the way men act when they are out in groups and on the prowl . the dynamics of a group of male friends is presented with a hilariously spot-on realism , with trent as alpha male directing the behavior of guys who are little like him , and in fact may not not _like_ him . that is another aspect of male friendships which is rarely represented on screen but which is nailed in favreau's script : men often find themselves hanging out with guys with whom they share virtually nothing in common . swingers gets its' characters relationships so right that it is almost frightening . it is rather disappointing that so much time is spent on mike mooning over his ex , given the stronger kick of the male-bonding scenes . the sad fact is that , like in real life , spending a lot of time with someone who does little but whine about his lost love gets to be a bit of a drag . mike's extremely tentative steps toward getting back on the horse are the frame on which the events in swingers hang , which makes it kind of a necessary evil . the comedy is much richer when favreau , liman and the cast of swingers take you on safari , observing a mating dance that is both strange and wonderfully familiar . "
1739,"unfortunately , that controversy is almost more compelling than the film itself , which proves that hero worship and drama can make uncomfortable companions . though violent and destructive , the program eventually brings the british to the bargaining table , but the result could be even more violent and destructive . "" i hate them for making hate necessary "" collins says in one of several scenes where jordan makes his soul-searching known to us , and it is only because liam neeson can sell such a line that it doesn't inspire eye-rolling . neeson has exactly the charisma and physical presence to be convincing as a nigh-mythical figure known as "" the big fella , "" but he also conveys a moral uncertainty . he plays collins with intelligence , conviction and sadness , and it is more thanks to neeson than it is to jordan that collins emerges as an intriguing character , a man of action forced to make an uneasy transition to man of peace . michael collins is usually a solid piece of drama when it focuses on the political , with alan rickman providing a complex counterpart to collins as the more politically calculating de valera . even though michael collins manages to avoid ever using two of the most critical words in the irish conflict -- "" catholic "" and "" protestant "" -- it still provides a strong overview of the pivotal years when the irish rebels realized that fighting dirty was the only option left to them . it is a good looking film with several fine performances ( including neil jordan regular stephen rea as an informant for collins inside the british government ) , but i don't think it ever pretends to be an objective history . michael collins is meant to be a monument to an important figure in irish lore , and it does a fine job of making him a monument .

1740,"paws . claws . gaping maws . pick your favorite ( or least obnoxious ) analogy-inspiring epithet , because no matter how stridently the makers of the ghost and the darkness insist that it is "" based on a true story , "" it owes at least as much to jaws as it does to real life . all right , so there isn't a matt hooper to be found , but don't try to tell me this comparison is a reach , especially when there is a scene in which patterson and remington attempt to attract their prey by laying down what amounts to a chum line around a building where they are lying in wait . ordinarily , it is be a remarkably bad idea for a film in any genre to make such obvious references to the classics of its genre , because they only serve to emphasize that you are not watching a much better movie of the same kind . yet there is something fairly satisfying about the ghost and the darkness , because it is a kind of suspense film you just don't see very often . a force of nature in its own element can be a truly frightening thing ; give that force of nature a vaguely unnatural personality , and you've got the ingredients for one scary piece of work . screenwriter william goldman knows what works in this kind of film , and when the lions are on the prowl in the ghost and the darkness , it is surprisingly gripping . director stephen hopkins ( blown away ) directs his action scenes with efficiency and a sense of barely-controlled chaos , and he is able to make the lions' every appearance a time to scoot to the edge of your seat . he may be no spielberg , but that's even true of spielberg sometimes . the reason the ghost and the darkness never approaches jaws in overall quality is what happens between the attacks . the performances are almost uniformly under-stated , with val kilmer doing solid work as the confident patterson , and john kani and brian mccardie are appealing as two of patterson's colleagues on the bridge project . that is even more true of douglas' remington than it is of the other characters -- he is a hunter with a tortured past whose one moment of introspection is supposed to define his entire personality . douglas is an actor given to playing characters broadly , and even though he is relatively restrained he still appears to be camping it up compared to his co-stars . you never care nearly as much about the individual humans in the ghost and the darkness as you should , because you don't really know who they are . still , at least there _are_ characters in the ghost and the darkness , and at least their confrontations with their adversaries get your adrenaline pumping . there is a tremendous primal appeal to the battle between man and beast , and with cinematographer vilmos zsigmond providing glorious photography and jerry goldsmith turning in one of his most effective recent scores , the ghost and the darkness turns it into solid , suspenseful film-making . perhaps there is less inherent claustrophobic tension when you take the men out of a boat and put them on dry land , but the ghost and the darkness makes sure you understand who has the home field advantage here . you may feel as though you have seen some of this before , but you haven't seen it in a long time , and you might realize that you have been missing it . farewell and adieu to you fair spanish ladies . . .

1741,"director of photography : clive tickner . producers : stephen evans , david parfitt . mpaa rating : pg ( adult themes ) running time : 125 minutes . there is a sub-category of shakespeare's comedies referred to by scholars as the "" problem plays , "" and thought twelfth night is not technically one of them , it is rather problematic in its own right . trevor nunn's adaptation of the play retains that sub-plot , which makes the film quite faithful . it is easy to turn twelfth night into a rather trivial farce , if an entertaining one , but nunn has opted for a surprisingly sensitive rendering of the tale . imogen stubbs is an appealing viola whose unrequited love is a source of both pain and frustration , and her defense of the depth of a woman's love is given a confident strength . perhaps most unconventional is nunn's choice of making the reunion between viola and sebastian the emotional climax of the film rather than the joining of any pair of lovers , yet it works thanks to a carefully established prologue and the restrained work of stubbs . helena bonham carter is simply wonderful as olivia -- smart , sexy , seductive and _very_ funny -- leaving a somewhat stiff toby stephens as the only squeaky wheel in an otherwise smooth , clockwork romantic comedy . hawthorne is an actor with a remarkable range , which results in the curious case of him pitching portions of his performance in a way which makes malvolio too sympathetic . a scene in which the fool feste ( a wry , philosophical ben kingsley ) impersonates a cleric to further taunt the imprisoned malvolio should be simply amusing , but hawthorne seems so genuinely confused and tormented that his comeuppance seems dreadfully unfair . it is an unusual instance where a less accomplished actor , who might have played the role quite broadly , might also have maintained a lighter tone . twelfth night may be uneven , but is still largely appealing , thanks to the talented cast and the unique design of the film . the locations in cornwall allow for some marvelous , liberating exteriors , and the late 18th century settings and costumes allow nunn to balance twelfth night on the border between period piece and contemporary romance . kingsley and smith make particularly inspired choices for their roles , lending humor both subtle and expansive , and richard e . grant is a perfect dim-witted fop as sir andrew aguecheek . trevor nunn's direction is unexpectedly restrained in small moments between viola and orsino given nunn's recent history staging massive stage productions like cats and les miserables , but his over 25 years as director of the royal shakespeare company have not been forgotten so easily . twelfth night is a problematic play , but nunn has served it well , making it a revel with a dark side that can't eclipse the bright .

1742,"mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , sexual situations ) running time : 101 minutes . my fellow americans is a buddy comedy . it is a bickering buddy comedy . it is a bickering-buddies-on-the-road comedy . in short , my fellow americans has about as generic a basic premise as there is in hollywood . so how does it end up so improbably entertaining ? because when it comes to film-making , story isn't even half the story -- execution is king . my fellow americans uses the familiar plot as a starting point , adds a script with just enough lively turns , and casts two consummate professionals in the lead roles . the result is a simple but engaging studio comedy , energized by the wonderful pairing of jack lemmon and james garner . you're going to see a lot of critics referring to my fellow americans as grumpy old presidents , and it's not just because jack lemmon is on board that comparisons to the grumpy old . . . films are appropriate . the most notable similarity is that my fellow americans also bases much of its humor on the notion that senior citizens spewing forth profanities are intrinsically hilarious ; no fewer than nineteen separate expletives season the dialogue of lemmon and garner . it is an unfortunate decision , if for no other reason than that it is unnecessary . political rivals should have more personalized gibes at their disposal , and indeed the script features a few nice zingers aimed at the stereotypes of each party . it would have been nice to see more -- and more pointed -- barbs , particularly like those aimed at haney's dim-witted vice-president ( john heard ) , whose mispronunciation of a single word may provide the film's biggest laugh . insult humor only goes as far as the slingers of the insults , though , and my fellow americans rises well above its material simply because lemmon and garner bring out the best in each other . lemmon's kramer is the more complete character , a politician who so desperately needs approval that he has become an over-eager joke . while kramer is the guy you can be sure promised everything to everybody , garner's douglas is the charismatic charmer who probably didn't have to . garner has long been one of the best actors around at playing the put-upon grouch , and it is a delight simply to see him in a leading role on the big screen again . the two are both perfectly matched and perfectly mis-matched ; there is something about their veteran interaction which makes the most mundane situations sing with comic confidence . there isn't much segal can do with the sentimental angle in the script , as the ex-presidents' encounter with an average american family leads them to ask the "" duh "" -inspiring question of whether politicians may be out of touch with their constituents . all these problems my fellow americans has , yet i laughed harder than i had any reason to expect . handed the sow's ear of a standard buddy-caper script , jack lemmon and james garner were able to turn it into a purse . . . perhaps not silk , but surprisingly smooth nonetheless .

1743,"i'm sure there are people out there who view beavis and butt-head do american as yet another sign that the end-times are upon us ; they are probably the same folks who have condemned from day one the mtv series on which it is based as a celebration of violence , stupidity and lack of respect . speaking as an admittedly defensive some-time fan of the show , i think "" beavis and butt-head "" is much smarter and more self-aware than its detractors give it credit for being . mike judge created a series for mtv which takes aim at the generation of youth mtv helped create : kids without the attention span to sit through an entire music video . do young viewers of the show sometimes delight in the anarchy and low humor without appreciating the sub-text ? probably , but the same statement is true of "" the simpsons , "" and no one would accuse "" the simpsons "" of not being smart . there's no point in pretending that beavis and butt-head do america doesn't traffic in plenty of below-the-belt gags -- and above-the-belt , where women are concerned -- because that is the level of beavis and butt-head's sense of humor . sex , masturbation , gas and other toilet functions all send the twosome into paroxysms of their trademark immature snickering , yet judge stages many of these moments with a knowing wit . that is not to say that a little beavis and butt-head doesn't go a long way . even fans of the series might find 80 minutes of their antics getting repetitive , particularly when connected to a standard "" mistaken identity "" premise in which morons take such bizarre actions that they are assumed to be brilliant . the series also benefits from the commentary on music videos which breaks up each episode's plot , and that commentary is missed in beavis and butt-head do america . its absence removes the rare opportunities you have to witness how selective their obliviousness can be as they analyze the cliches of videos . judge tosses in some clever bits unrelated to the series , including a great opening credits sequence scored to a "" shaft "" -like isaac hayes tune and voice cameos by cloris leachman and a fellow credited as "" earl hofer "" ( david letterman's nom-de-cinema in cabin boy ) , but most of the gags are directed squarely at fans of the show . the uninitiated might find themselves baffled at the applause which goes up for cornholio , beavis' caffeine- and sugar-fueled alter-ego . a keen grasp of reality prevents me from attempting anything like a conversion of "" beavis and butt-head "" haters . hard-core opponents consider them not just annoying but actively evil , an animated pair of potty-mouthed pauly shores sucking the collective will to think out of the heads of america's impressionable youth . but beavis and butt-head do america , crude though it may be , is more genuinely inventive than space jam and 101 dalmatians combined , and less insulting to the intelligence of younger viewers . all it takes is a very funny moment which underscores the futility of butt-head trying to piece together a rather elementary crime scene to point out that dumb characters don't have to mean a dumb movie . beavis and butt-head do america overcomes its fundamental dopiness to provide entertainment for those prepared to laugh with its self-absorbed protagonists _and_ those prepared to laugh at them .

1745,"screenplay : kevin williamson . director : wes craven . mpaa rating : r ( violence , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 105 minutes . in the late 70s and early 80s , theater screens were overrun by a film genre which had primarily teenage audiences filling the seats and sociologists shaking their heads . it was the golden age -- if that isn't a gross misapplication of the term -- of the slasher movie , where cutlery-wielding crazies turned every possible day on the calendar ( halloween , friday the 13th , prom night , mother's day , my bloody valentine ) into a stomach-churning ordeal . these films usually differed only in the manner of the violent killings , leading to a numbing predictability deserving only of parody . wes craven's scream wants to have some fun with the conventions of the slasher movie , but not at the expense of providing a few scares of its own . that presents problems as well as opportunities , as the self-aware script sometimes diffuses the tension craven can create as a director . in scream , the students at woodsboro high are facing more profound problems than the usual homework and bad skin . as scream begins , it looks like it is going to be a fairly conventional horror film , if an unusually gripping one . most of the familiar tropes of the slasher movie are in place -- the absentee parents , the improbably massive house with plenty of glass , the ever-alarming ringing phone -- but the sequence is still scary stuff , with barrymore providing an effective and convincing portrait of mounting panic . though much of scream becomes a joke at the expense of monotonously violent horror films , craven is not about to spit in the face of the genre which made his career . horror films in general are not the target in scream -- horror films with no style or imagination are , and craven provides both throughout the film , though nowhere as effectively as the opening . what happens between the scares is what gives scream its knowing edge . kevin williamson's script is loaded with references to horror films -- it seems that half a dozen are aimed at craven alone -- and loaded with characters who have seen other horror films . many of those references are spelled out quite literally , and they are the least interesting . some of the most subversive humor is the least obvious , however . scream plays with expectations effectively , making the guessing game part of the in-joke . the guessing ends in a climax which , while certainly surprising , isn't particularly effective . it is also excessively drawn out , as writer and director seem to engage in an ideological battle over whether it is going to be the climax to a horror film or a commentary on the climaxes of horror films . in the end it is both , which is to say that it is neither . some of the gags are quite funny , but the suspense all but vanishes in the final fifteen minutes as the characters talk their way through a comparison of this finale to the traditional finale . the script for scream is not clever enough to provide a consistently witty thriller ; it is sometimes witty and sometimes thrilling , but never both . that alone makes scream stand out from its genre cousins , though , as wes craven reminds us that terror can be fun , and not simply a grueling march through gore-spattered holidays .

1746,"director : jerry zaks . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( some strong profanity , mature themes ) . running time : 97 minutes . please ignore the next couple of sentences if you are a stickler about having no part of a plot spoiled for you : in marvin's room , nobody dies . illness plays a significant role in the story , and many viewers have come to resent maudlin disease-of-the-week melodramas in which everything seems to function as an extended prologue to a tear-jerking deathbed scene . there is something terribly dehumanizing about making an illness the central character in a narrative , so it is a relief to discover that marvin's room is actually about people . though occasionally stage-bound and over-plotted , marvin's room finds superb actors lending a surprisingly restrained touch to a genre crying out for a little restraint . fortunately , marvin's room isn't _about_ aids any more than it is _about_ any disease . it is about estrangement and reconciliation and family ties , and it covers this treacherous ground with as much comedy as sadness . stage veteran jerry zaks does fine work with his rookie screen effort , and the gifted cinematographer piotr sobocinski ( krzysztof kieslowski's red ) gives marvin's room a warm , comforting glow . the overall effect of the film is an unusual one for films of its kind : it draws you in without pouncing on you with over-wrought emotions . the superb cast certainly deserves much of the credit for that success . and of course there is meryl streep , an actress so talented it has become a sort of cinematic sport to mock her versatility . here she plays lee with an anger which drives her every action ( though she does indulge in that well-work actor's crutch of acting with her cigarette on occasion ) , and she is convincing both in her early resistance to any overtures of good will and in her slow realization that she cares more about her sister than she realized . there is a particular grace to her honest portrayal of someone terribly uncomfortable with being around illness . there are certainly times when marvin's room feels hemmed in by its stage roots , and conversations build to an over-dramatized pitch . mcpherson's script also over plays its comic relief card , particularly in the person of dan hedaya as a lithium-medicated receptionist who seems more appropriate to an episode of "" murphy brown . "" dicaprio's character also feels out of place occasionally , as though every time the story turned back to him it was in danger of losing its way . but the important factor in marvin's room is that these people don't get together for the express purpose of watching one of them die . living is more interesting -- and more complicated -- than dying , and mcpherson created a work which recognizes that fact . you don't have to have a funeral to touch real emotions .

1747,"screenplay : woody allen . director : woody allen . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 95 minutes . woody allen is one of the unlikeliest film-makers i can think of to try to revive the movie musical . it is true that allen has made nostalgia something of his personal fiefdom , and that he clearly loves the old standards , but that doesn't necessarily make him the best man for the job . to oversimplify the matter somewhat , the near-total disappearance of the musical as a cinematic genre has been the product of a less innocent era ; for a musical to work its magic on you , you had to surrender to its often-absurd optimism , something increasingly difficult to do in a cynical time . woody allen may not necessarily be a cynic , but he has become somewhat synonymous with sophistication . everyone says i love you is an entertaining trifle which never truly transports you because allen is too often outside the genre . this may be the first meta-musical . everyone says i love you deals with the complicated romantic entanglements of an upscale extended family . everyone says i love you is an experiment , to be sure , with most of the actors singing their own parts and production numbers popping up in the oddest places . a couple of the numbers work superbly , notably a ghostly dance to "" enjoy yourself ( it's later than you think ) "" which is reminiscent of disneyland's haunted mansion , but watching this film makes you realize how long it may have been since you've seen characters break into song on screen ; even though you know it is a musical , it is a bit startling every time a song begins . the problem with everyone says i love you isn't the songs , it is allen's approach to them . his audience is notoriously upscale , and he makes his films decidedly with that audience in mind ; how better to explain the knowing laughter which accompanies a cameo appearance by itzhak perlman playing violin at a party ? in fact , knowing laughter plays a significant role in everyone says i love you . allen appears to be banking not on the songs and dances themselves being entertaining , but on their silly incongruity being entertaining . one moment , a light-hearted duet between goldie hawn and woody allen on the banks of the seine , strikes a perfect low-key tone , but it is a rare exception . allen has made a comedy in which the object of much of the humor is the fact that people are singing and dancing ; he is getting us to laugh _at_ the musical genre , not with it . one of the ironies of that effect is that allen may also have given a winking acknowledgment to critics of his romanticized view of new york . there is plenty to laugh at in everyone says i love you , from skylar's propensity for swallowing engagement rings to one hilarious swipe at italians from a teutonic housekeeper , as well as inspired performances by edward norton ( effortlessly charming in his two musical numbers ) and tim roth ( hilarious as a suspicious criminal thrust into high society ) . curiously , those two performances also emphasize why everyone says i love you isn't better . they offer a couple of rare moments of unrestrained glee in a story which feels constrained by its characters' social positions , even though allen is all too conscious of the world in which he has set his story . it is noteworthy that the marx brothers play a significant role in the film's climax ( as well as the title , a tune prominently featured in horse feathers ) , because everyone says i love you is a musical in the sense that the marx brothers' early films were musicals , where songs serving romantic sub-plots only got in the way of the real funny material . it is also set in the posh world the marxes used to tear to shreds , only the classy folks are the heroes this time . everyone says i love you sings , but it might have soared if the guiding sensibility had been groucho instead of margaret dumont .

1748,"screenplay : steve james and eugene corr . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity ) running time : 103 minutes . as the opening scenes of prefontaine unfold , you could be excused for worrying about its prospects as a drama . those scenes include a lot of documentary-style footage of track races , as well as "" talking head "" shots of the actors playing steve prefontaine's friends and family , complete with captions identifying the characters . well , anyone concerned about james' ability as a story-teller didn't see hoop dreams . though he may have a few things to learn about directing actors and writing dialogue , james crafts prefontaine into a compelling character study which takes surprising turns for a sports film . one of the things which makes prefontaine more satisfying than the average underdog-makes-good bio-pic is that the style gives it a unique rhythm . james has cinematographer peter gilbert employ a hand-held camera for many sequences , creating a kind of urgent energy which matches prefontaine's personality . the script does an efficient job of establishing how his lack of success as an under-sized youth baseball and football player drove him to find a place where his refusal to surrender would be enough , as well as the arrogant sense of personal invincibility which often made him reckless . jared leto ( heartthrob jordan catalano from "" my so-called life "" ) gives a naturalistic performance encouraged by the documentary style , but his intensity isn't always as convincing as it could be . he has the golden boy charisma down pat , without all the ferocity . he is convincing enough , however , to make the arc of his character intriguing . then prefontaine makes the unexpected choice not to be about whether or not pre wins his race , but about how he responds to a disappointing result . james' use of documentary clips from the olympics does slow the film down somewhat , but it also establishes the 1972 olympics as a kind of turning point in the perception of "" amateur "" athletics . most sports movies are about the main character ( s ) winning , and a few are about the main character ( s ) just doing their best . i can't think of many other sports movies which were about a character who learns to define himself apart from his sport . there are plenty of places steve james betrays his inexperience with fiction film-making , notably with some flat characters like pre's girlfriend nancy ( amy locane ) and the tough-but-caring coach played with enthusiasm by r . lee ermey , as well as a pace which makes prefontaine feel long at only 105 minutes . yet there are two scenes in which james shows the kind of handle he has on his material . the first is the olympic 5 , 000 meter race , directed with a pulse-quickening energy ; you know someone is doing an exceptional job of film-making if you know the result of the race and you are still sitting on the edge of your seat . the second is more subtle , but perhaps more important to the impact of prefontaine's story . prefontaine died in the crash at the age of 24 , and the success of prefontaine as a film comes from the fact that we appreciate this tragedy not as the loss of a fine athlete , but as the loss of someone who was becoming a fine human being . a subtle distinction , perhaps , but one which separates mediocre directors from good ones . steve james knows his film-making , whether the subject is fact or fiction .

1749,"call 911 for the cliche police if you must , but the eyes are the window to the soul . the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze : paul newman , ralph fiennes , anthony hopkins , morgan freeman . you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds , that the characters they play are real human beings . we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor , but he had that unique quality in his eyes . in gridlock'd , an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire , shakur and his co-star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry . they soon make a new year's resolution to get into rehab , but that proves to be easier said than done . the world in gridlock'd is just as frustrating as the world in falling down , but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time . hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system , but perhaps not enough of them . a significant chunk of gridlock'd is devoted to spoon and stretch's flight from d-reper and from the police , and those sub-plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments . the entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running , while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time . hall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film's main events , perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self-destructive behavior . oh , the irony of it . tupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case , and living the life to back it up . mostly it comes through those eyes , eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta . with friends like that , spoon doesn't need enemies , and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much . the tragedy now is that we won't get more chances to see those eyes again .

1752,"it has been too long since we have seen gena rowlands on screen , but it takes only a few minutes of unhook the stars to recall how good she can be . we know instantly , of course , that this isn't true . mothers tend to get very shabby treatment in the movies , portrayed as perpetual nags or otherwise treated as comic relief , but rowlands' performance as mildred is beautifully balanced and convincing . if unhook the stars had focused entirely on mildred , it might have been a great film . in a film which is otherwise low-key and observant , tomei starts to crank up the adorable loud-mouth routine to my cousin vinny levels . a scene in which monica is a guest for thanksgiving dinner -- much to the consternation of mildred's straight-laced son ethan ( david sherrill ) -- plays like something from a much broader fish-out-of-water comedy , and drags on for an awfully long time . tomei's performance isn't a bad one ; it's just a good one in a different kind of movie . her character exists mostly to provide the laughs , and whether or not monica and her estranged husband reconcile is only interesting because it affects mildred . cassavetes makes the mistake of treating that issue as one in which we have an equal emotional investment . big tommy's passes are rather absurd , and not simply because mildred is a much older woman . that romance ultimately has little to do with mildred's development through unhook the stars , but cassavetes doesn't quite seem to realize what a great character he has in mildred , and what a unique arc her story takes without the distractions of a wacky neighbor or a romantic interest . that is more of a testimony to how good unhook the stars is when rowlands is center stage than it is to a lack of quality the rest of the time . you only wish you could have watched without the supporting characters jumping up and obscuring your view quite so often .

1753,"screenplay : christopher guest and eugene levy . director : christopher guest . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 83 minutes . the reason inspired satire is so rare nowadays is that people have been given a warped perception of what satire is . the popular culture -- fed by "" saturday night live , "" david letterman and even political pundits -- has created the notion that irony , sarcasm and satire are interchangeable , and that there is something inherently hip about ridicule as a spectator sport . but it takes no imagination to savage someone or something you despise ; the best satire in any medium has been born of affection , from people with a gift for pointing out the negative while recognizing the positive . this is spinal tap , the best comedy of the 1980s , was a brilliant satire of the excesses of rock and roll which also respected the commitment of the artists to their work . waiting for guffman , a comedy from tap alum christopher guest , is a more uneven effort , but it is at its funniest skewering small-town america in all its cockeyed optimism . publicity for waiting for guffman is emphasizing the spinal tap connection by describing guest as "" the lead guitarist of spinal tap , "" but i don't think that comparison does guffman any favors . yes , it is similarly filmed in a faux documentary style , and derives a similar off-beat energy from its largely improvised script . however , there are fewer outrageous high points , largely the result of a less inherently outrageous milieu . the more you expect a middle-american spinal tap , the more time you might spend waiting for the inevitable disasters in the play which turn out to be not so inevitable after all . it may take sitting through all of "" red , white and blaine "" before it becomes clear that waiting for guffman is not going to be a parade of incompetence , though guest ( who co-wrote the story with co-star levy ) does have fun with the cloistered perspectives of his characters . guest has taken some heat for his swishy portrayal , but i think such criticism misses the point . everyone watching the film understands that corky is supposed to be gay , but no one _in_ the film understands it . gay men simply are not part of their world , so no one thinks twice about why they have never seen corky's "" wife "" bonnie , or about his exaggerated mannerisms being anything but "" theatrical . "" the real subject of waiting for guffman , however , isn't merely how narrow the world-view of blaine's residents may be , but how the residents involved in the production respond to a whiff of big city show-biz . you may spend much of waiting for guffman waiting for "" red , white and blaine "" to be terrible , but it isn't terrible . it is simply ridiculous , of course , that a show like this could ever go to broadway , but the performers are too wonderfully naive to recognize that fact . waiting for guffman is occasionally sluggish through its middle half hour , and hardly the non-stop riot spinal tap was ; it also treats its characters with far more good-humored respect than you might expect . guest understands that it is possible to laugh at people and still love them , and that fine satire can be achieved with the poke of a finger as well as a sledgehammer .

1754,"screenplay : david aaron cohen & vincent patrick & kevin jarre . producers : lawrence gordon and robert f . colesberry . director : alan j . pakula . you can bet that sony pictures executives have spent plenty of time in the last few weeks hoping that there is , in fact , no such thing as bad press . then , in a newsweek interview , brad pitt took a few shots at the mid-stream script changes on his upcoming film the devil's own , inspiring the kind of spin control usually seen only on the teacup ride at disneyland . pitt's comments were surprising in an era when stars are generally obliged to swoon over their latest project , but it may be even more surprising to see the end product of the process which frustrated him so . the devil's own is an uncommonly thoughtful suspense film with a razor-sharp performance by pitt , proving that pitt's standards may be considerably higher than anyone else's in hollywood . if anything , it is the missed opportunities for even more detailed characterizations which end up disappointing . the bonding between them is casual and un-dramatic -- a game of pool here , a snippet of conversation there -- and director alan j . pakula trusts the actors to establish a connection without resorting to trite dialogue or inappropriate outbursts of emotion . we like them , too , and for quite a while both of them are the heroes of the devil's own . . . until pitt plays the anti-hero to ford's more conventional square-jawed hero , and it is hard to choose sides between them . in a film with such an unconventional struggle at its center , it is all the more jarring when conventional formula elements rear their ugly heads . obligatory psycho-villain treat williams gets to ooze malevolence and serve up severed heads ; obligatory romantic interest natascha mcelhone gets to be gorgeous and supportive of frankie . those occurrences are relatively rare , however , because the devil's own doesn't move the way you expect suspense thrillers to move . the action sequences are infrequent but emphatic , with a premium placed on the patient establishment of character . in that scene , tom suggests that he never wanted to be a cop , a sub-text which appears out of nowhere and might have given more depth to the character throughout the film . there are certainly instances where the devil's own feels like the product of a script-by-committee , but the star power of ford and pitt in an intriguing relationship guides it over its rough points . i could only hope to be subjected to more "" troubled productions "" like this .

1755,"only a year later , smith made a studio-financed follow-up called mallrats , a film so widely reviled that smith publicly apologized for it , announcing "" i don't know what i was thinking . "" though he sometimes explores his themes with more earnestness than clarity , smith gives chasing amy both a wicked sense of humor and a genuine sensitivity about the complications of sexual politics . for the first half-hour of chasing amy , kevin smith concentrates on churning out the laughs with his often-crude , usually pop-culture-heavy dialogue . he shows an admirable willingness to take on potentially thorny topics like gay stereotypes -- there's a great sequence involving a gay black comic book writer ( dwight ewell ) who is forced to keep up a public image as a militant afro-centrist -- and a conversation about archie and jughead as gay lovers works despite its forced tarantino-as-a-slacker quality . smith even pulls off a riff on jaws in which banky and alyssa compare wounds from oral sex horror stories like an emotionally immature richard dreyfuss and a lesbian robert shaw ( though the flashback literalization of those stories is ill-advised ) . while the jokes are rarely profound , they are usually effective and delivered with zing by the actors . it doesn't help that two of the longer speeches are delivered by joey lauren adams , a talented actress but one whose jennifer tilly voice becomes grating when emotional scenes force her to wail for several minutes at a time . smith clearly wants to stretch himself beyond satiric comedy , but he never quite finds a pace which gives the more serious moments in chasing amy a spark to match their sincerity . it's a shame smith's romantic observations never quite click as drama , because his ideas are far more intriguing than most of what is served up in contemporary romantic comedies . there is an impressive lack of judgmental posturing in the way smith develops his characters , and he shows keen insight into how different people respond to societal norms about sexual behavior . it's simply clear that smith is still a guy who writes like people sitting around talking , and that style works much better with comedy than with drama . when it is at its funniest , chasing amy reminds you why everyone was so high on kevin smith in the wake of clerks . and even when it falters as a drama , it proves that smith isn't content with making clerks over and over . or , perhaps more important , that he won't make mallrats over and over .

1756,"director : lynne stopkewich . mpaa rating : unrated ( sexual situations , nudity , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 78 minutes . canada's david cronenberg has already delivered one exploration of the bond between carnality and mortality in 1997 , the much-talked-about crash , and now countrywoman lynne stopkewich has presented us with kissed . her narration is surprisingly effective at explaining the reasons for and the impact of sandra's actions , and molly parker plays sandra as a decent , focused young woman who understands how her necrophilia is viewed by others . stopkewich gives matt an enigmatic history -- he's a medical student who is taking time off for an unexplained reason -- and outerbridge gives a painful conviction to his growing frustration with his inability to satisfy sandra . sandra has come to terms with her unique needs , and it is to stopkewich's credit that sandra is portrayed as someone with compassion rather than as a twisted fiend . the arc of the story may be fairly predictable , but that story is skillfully constructed to make the fate of the characters matter . there is an unexpected warmth to kissed . being canadian doesn't mean you have to turn sex -- even sex with a corpse -- into something cold and emotionless .

1757,"screenplay : jim mcglynn . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 100 minutes . most films about con artists treat the big con as the only reason the story exists ; once it's clear who's been had and who's done the having , it's time to strike the set and call it a wrap . not so for traveller , a frisky and well-crafted drama which takes the time to develop its characters and its atmosphere . bokky becomes pat's mentor in the family business , creating plenty of entertaining opportunities for the audience to watch the development of their cons . screenwriter jim mcglynn wisely avoids turning those scenes into the foundation of traveller , instead allowing them to act as comic flavoring for a nicely observed character study . the actors make traveller consistently interesting to watch while mcglynn and director jack green ( the gifted cinematographer of unforgiven and the bridges of madison county , making his directing debut ) slowly explore their relationships . and there are plenty of relationships to explore . these tangents push the film's most unique element -- the culture of the travellers -- into the background ; the production notes provide more sense of who the travellers are than the film itself . as the climax of the film turns into a violent hostage drama , traveller begins to feel rather generic , as though its unique spirit has been compromised for manufactured conflict . still , there is plenty to like about traveller , from its casually confident pacing to its evocative soundtrack of blues and country classics . thanks to rich characterizations and a strong cast , this is one story of con men in which the "" men "" are more important than the "" con .

1758,"i have come up with a definition -- admittedly arbitrary -- for "" tv-movie "" as it tends to be used in a derogatory fashion . melodrama certainly plays a part in that definition , but it is more symptom than disease . the real problem with tv-movies is that they tend to be about issues , not about people . melodrama results from a story about a situation ; drama results from a story about people responding to a situation . hollow reed has been garnering some comparisons to tv-movies which are only half fair . the story concerns that tv-movie standby the custody battle , with a few provocative twists . hollow reed really covers two issues , then : domestic violence , and attitudes about homosexuality both institutional and personal . on the first front , cries of "" tv-movie "" amount to utter nonsense . director angela pope has crafted a splendid domestic drama which includes many wrenching scenes of people coping with personal turmoil . sam bould's performance as oliver is the centerpiece of that story , a quiet and reflective piece of work which allows the audience to feel his fear , confusion and isolation . as long as hollow reed is focused on the dynamics of hannah , frank and oliver , it is truly exceptional . there is , however , another issue with which to grapple , and the grappling is frequently clumsy . martin donovan , the laconic protagonist of hal hartley's trust , simple men and flirt , here plays another laconic protagonist . in hartley's films , donovan's mannered delivery works with the surreal situations ; in hollow reed , donovan is like a mugging victim who mutters "" stop , thief . "" pope tries to make up for that lack of spark by providing a big court-room scene where hollow reed begins to feel exactly like a tv-movie . the testimony is treated like a therapy session where the characters' deep dark feelings are exposed , turning the climax into a lecture . like the least effective tv-movies , hollow reed starts to feel like it is exists to arouse your indignation rather than to involve you emotionally . if hollow reed is ultimately worthwhile viewing , it is because there is much more right with the domestic violence story-line than there is wrong with the gay rights story-line . still , the way pope and writer paula milne approach each issue shows that a timely topic does not a tv-movie make . it's only the latter that you'd probably see on fox starring one of the cast members of "" melrose place .

1759,"screenplay : robert gordon . director : griffin dunne . mpaa rating : r ( adult themes , sexual situations , profanity ) running time : 101 minutes . begin with the fact that addicted to love is about two people stalking their respective ex-lovers , and you'll see that it isn't exactly your conventional romantic comedy . that's a strong statement when you consider that "" conventional "" and "" romantic comedy "" are virtually synonymous where major studios are concerned . perhaps more than any other genre , the romantic comedy thrives on predictability , in much the same way that romance novels thrive on predictability . addicted to love is a film which takes risks within that genre , which makes it a rarity . the fact that so many of those risks pay off makes it particularly intriguing . perhaps the most impressive thing about addicted to love is how it makes its tricky premise work . screenwriter robert gordon could have gone for all-out farce in which the motivations of the characters mattered less than their wacky actions ; he could have made linda and anton so one-dimensionally villainous that they seemed to deserve whatever they got . sam is a man whose obsession is less pathological than scientific -- he keeps watching linda because her behavior just doesn't make sense based on his rational observations . even anton is a complicated creation , with tcheky karyo giving a surprisingly engaging performance as a man who is more self-absorbed than malicious . addicted to love draws comedy and emotion from understanding of the people involved . it was also a risk pairing broderick and ryan , since both have made careers out of characters notable largely for their geniality . broderick doesn't stray far from that persona , though he is still very appealing as a decent guy doing some indecent things . it is ryan who stretches the most , perhaps even farther than she stretched in the straight drama of courage under fire . this is no sally albright she is playing -- there isn't a shred of romantic wistfulness left in maggie . her comic lines are savage and bitter , allowing ryan to display a darker comedic edge which previous roles hadn't given her a chance to show . her performance gives the romance unexpected depth , lending poignancy to scenes like a romantic interlude with broderick in which each participant is thinking about the one he or she _really_ loves . none of this would matter much , of course , if addicted to love weren't also funny . there are plenty of quirky laughs in gordon's script , from a sweet scene between ryan and broderick providing dialogue for a conversation between anton and linda to a stampede of cockroaches through a restaurant . griffin dunne's direction provides the one jarring flaw in addicted to love , creating an awkward rhythm in those comic moments of maggie and sam's plan against anton which isn't always in synch with the character development . the broad physical humor is sometimes out of place in a story which does such a good job of creating characters struggling to heal emotionally . then again , that is just one more way in which addicted to love doesn't take you exactly where you might expect to go . in case it really matters , addicted to love is a conventional enough romantic comedy that it provides a suitably happy ending . beyond that , let it surprise you .

1760,"directors : ron clements & john musker . mpaa rating : g . running time : 90 minutes . over the past few years , while most studio event films were growing bigger , louder and dumber , the folks at disney were doing something terribly underhanded with their animated features . like cereal makers injecting twelve essential vitamins and minerals into our frosted sugar bombs , they were slipping competent story-telling into our entertainment . in films like pocahontas , toy story and the hunchback of notre dame , the mouse gave our unsuspecting children reason to expect thematic depth , complex villains and appealing heroes even while they were being amused and dazzled . it's all terribly insidious , this raising of expectations , and not just for audiences . expectations in the disney boardroom were raised by the $530 million in domestic grosses racked up by aladdin and the lion king , making the mere $140 million for pocahontas and $100 million for hunchback look like chump change . perhaps , uncle walt's successors may have concluded , audiences would rather eat a salad when they want their twelve essential vitamins and minerals . all this being prologue to the observation that hercules , a frisky and energetic offering from directors john musker and ron clements ( who helped revive the moribund disney animation empire with the frisky and energetic the little mermaid and aladdin ) , is merely a pleasant way to spend a saturday afternoon . no trouble so far . . . in fact , there's quite a bit to recommend hercules . british cartoonist gerald scarfe , who acted as production designer , gives hercules a distinct look full of sharp angles and stylized characterizations which separates it from other recent disney efforts . there are a couple of very catchy tunes by disney stalwart alan menken and new lyricist david zippel , including a wonderful brill building-style love song called "" i won't say . "" musker and clements also trot out the kind of pop culture references which worked so well in aladdin , including quotes of the karate kid , midnight cowboy and the seven year itch as well as some deft satire of over-saturated merchandising . if hercules had come up with a heart to match its art , it might have been deserving of that "" masterpiece "" label disney affixes indiscriminately to its animated features . it starts out with promise , presenting the adolescent hercules ( voiced by joshua keaton and perfectly rendered as a gawky jumble of massive hands and feet ) as the quintessential teen-age outsider . it's not exactly a redemption story , not exactly a quest story , and not exactly a love story . it is , quite simply , a cartoon . the fact that there's anything remotely dismissive about that term shows how far disney has raised the bar on animated film-making . even hercules , which comes up short in defining its hero , delivers complex supporting characters like meg ( a superb vocal performance by susan egan ) with real emotions . after recent disney triumphs , however , we know that more is possible . children will probably be more delighted by hercules than by the darker hunchback , and adults will probably enjoy james woods' oily wheeler-dealer manner as hades ( we all knew that the devil was really an agent ) . hercules is one of the better entertainments of the summer , a big tasty bowl of frosted sugar bombs . if you want your vitamins this time , you'll have to order a side salad with that .

1761,"indeed , his manner with her borders on outright insolence , but such treatment seems to be exactly what the queen needs to rouse her from her gloom . brown had been a love story , it would be a pretty poor excuse for one . jeremy brock's script offers far too few scenes between the two principles , providing very little sense of the basis for those rumors ; their relationship is as much a rumor to viewers of the film as to the scandal-mongers it portrays . victoria's devotion to brown remains unexplored , the feelings of both parties purely a matter of conjecture . brown isn't a love story at all . instead , it's a drama of political intrigue , both on a national scale and within the queen's own household . the monarchy is no longer inviolate in the eyes of the public , the idea of abolishing it no longer heretical . brown is quite effective as a portrait of rumor as political lever , as well as the changing perception of monarchy . brown works as a companion piece to another recent film about the british crown in turmoil , the madness of king george -- think of this one as the sadness of queen victoria . the household politics are less clearly drawn , due largely to the uneven characterization of brown . brown refuses to suffer fools of any social station , a quality which is both his greatest asset and his greatest fault . his motivations , however , fluctuate too frequently -- at times he seems self-serving , at other times insanely devoted to victoria . it is antony sher's performance as disraeli which really makes mrs . brown worth watching , capturing the work of a consummate politician in an era when consummate politicians were few and far between . brown were half as compelling behind the doors of balmoral castle as it is behind the doors of parliament , it could have been as fine a romantic tragedy as it is a piece of political theater . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1763,"as feel-good formulaic as it may be in its own way , shall we dance ? also demonstrates a kind of charming restraint you don't often find in american films . in a hollywood film , you can bet that sub-plot would be turned into a stream of slapstick comedy and crazy misunderstandings . in shall we dance ? , writer/director masayuki suo dispenses with it in a matter of minutes , using it to set up later character interactions rather than letting it overwhelm the story with pratfalls . suo gives his comedy the graceful movements of his subject matter , allowing the humor to flow from the characters rather than forcing it upon them . an opening prologue in shall we dance ? goes to some effort to place the film in a sociological perspective , explaining how contrary ballroom dancing is to the japanese sense of propriety . it's a forced message in a story which doesn't need such a culture-specific angle . plays the role of a singles' mixer , with everyone vaguely embarrassed to be there yet taking the opportunity to try on new personalities . sugiyama's awakening is less overt , but koji yakusho does a wonderful job showing a transformation of small steps . it's a delicate performance with a huge heart . shall we dance ? is a fairly lightweight experience , which makes its final half hour rather a long sit . suo crams a lot of exposition into very little time , including an unnecessarily detailed back-story for mai , resulting in a sluggish march towards the resolution . it is here that shall we dance ? feels most hollywood-conventional , attempting to blind-side the audience with a truckload of emotional catharsis . that's the real joy of dance shall we dance ? conveys : its ability to create an intoxicating mood of romance which can soften the stiffest shirt . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1764,"watching the most infectious comic moment in the british import the full monty -- a film rich with infectious comic moments -- can teach you a lot about what so many hollywood comedies get so wrong . it's a wonderful bit of comic film-making , surprisingly restrained and staged with impeccable momentum and timing . it also comes in a context which gives the laughter more bite . their spontaneous burst of energy in that dole queue is a physical manifestation of optimism . they're trying something to become men again , by god , even if it's as ridiculous a notion as dropping trou -- or going "" the full monty "" in brit-speak -- in front of 400 howling women . now i'm not saying it isn't worth several chuckles simply watching the out-of-shape mates muddle their way through their pirouettes and pelvic thrusts ; incongruity is the mother of classic physical comedy . i'm willing to wager , however , that a hollywoodized version of the full monty would miss the point entirely . in this hypothetical american monty , the idea of six working-class blokes becoming strippers , none of them ideal physical specimens , would be treated as inherently hilarious . it would become a broad farce , with chris farley re-creating his "" saturday night live "" sketch challenging patrick swayze for a spot in the chippendales line-up . the full monty isn't an effective comedy because the stars are unattractive . it's an effective comedy because the characters _are_ attractive , because their dilemma is genuine and their solution is ripe with possibilities . ironically , the most noteworthy flaws in the full monty might have been erased by a good old hollywood script doctoring . screenwriter simon beaufoy dangles a few too many plot threads for no apparent reason , including a gay romance which never matters much to the story . dramatic confrontations interfere with the comedic flow , as though beaufoy didn't trust the performances and basic plot situations to generate enough sympathy for his characters . though not nearly as pedantic as the similarly-themed brassed off ! , the full monty still treads dangerously close to pathos at times , clashing with the lads' growing enthusiasm for their new calling . the full monty may be a high-concept premise , but the execution is resolutely low-concept . that's a combination hollywood is having a tough time putting together in its comedies . comedy with ideas doesn't have to be leaden ; comedy with big laughs doesn't have to be simple-minded . the full monty gives depth to dole-line disco . . . _that's_ high comedy . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1765,"mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , violence , brief nudity ) running time : 140 minutes . early though it may be to make such a prediction , i'm going to do so : no one will be more deserving of an adapted screenplay oscar in 1997 than brian helgeland and curtis hanson . james ellroy's 1990 novel "" l . a . confidential "" was 496 pages of sprawling , tangled plotting and a staccato prose style in which entire chapters seemed to fly by without a single verb rearing its active little head . even the author himself said he didn't always know what was going on at any given time . hanson and helgeland took that narrative and tamed it into an intricate but accessible crime drama . they remained true to both the style and gritty substance of the story while giving it the appeal of pop entertainment . which is not to say that they have created an unqualified triumph . l . a . confidential is the kind of sturdy , satisfying studio vehicle which turns up rarely enough that it's easy to mistake it for a minor masterpiece . it's well-crafted but never dazzling , consistently interesting without being engrossing . helgeland and hanson haven't exactly taken an unfilmable novel and turned it into a classic . they've taken a novel which would have been a three hour art film and made a 140-minute mainstream multiplex success . there's more than a whiff of chinatown to l . a . confidential -- it's hard not to break into a chuckle when one character appears with a jake gittes memorial nose bandage -- but the story manages to stake out its own unique territory in exposing the dark side of booming post-war los angeles . it does a particularly impressive job of hooking into the relationship between high-profile crime and the media , skewering the public's inexhaustible appetite for sordid tales about which they can feel morally superior . curtis hanson's direction manages to navigate a smart path between the glossy image of hollywood and the sleazy reality . it's a perfectly appropriate ambiguity that l . a . confidential ( photographed by the talented dante spinotti ) may be one of the best-looking films ever made about ugly doings . it's also appropriate that the characters are similarly ambiguous , complex people whose motivations are never as pure or as selfish as they appear at first glance . another of the accomplishments in this fine script is that those characters feel softer and more humanized than they do in ellroy's novel , easier to sympathize with . yet one of the problems with l . a . confidential is that while the characters are uniformly well-acted and multi-dimensional , there's not enough time to get under the skin of any one character . we find ourselves surprised by some of the decisions the characters make , but once we understand a single basic motivation for each one there's not much left to learn about them . pearce , crowe and spacey do solid work with solid characters . they're never boring , and never fascinating . hanson and helgeland still do an impressive enough job that i couldn't help wishing they had trusted their own skill with material a bit more . the plot twists of l . a . confidential may be a lot to take in , but not so much that they require the constant nudging the script and direction provide . every character is identified in bold letters ( sometimes literally ) , every significant development is accompanied by a flashback or wordy exposition to make sure we realize the significance , and whole chunks of the film are summarized at various points like chapter-ending cliff's notes . it all gives a smart film the feeling that it's not quite so smart after all , or that the audience isn't expected to be smart enough to figure it all out . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1767,"here's an easy short-hand for thinking about the peacemaker : it's a james bond film without james bond . okay , so there's no sex and no vodka martinis , but the peacemaker comes with virtually everything else you could ask for in an espionage thriller : superbly crafted action sequences , a charismatic hero , marvelous production values , the threat of mass destruction , humor and style . at times , it's as satisfying an action film as 1997 has produced to date . that's bound to come as a surprise considering the folks both behind and in front of the camera . her sense of timing an action scene , ably assisted by editor david rosenbloom , creates tension in unlikely places ; her instinct for effective restraint ( like the positively heretical decision to show two trains hurtling towards one another , then cut away before the collision ) is uncommon and welcome . leder instantly distinguishes herself as a big-screen action director to watch for . george clooney , meanwhile , has previously distinguished himself on the big screen largely by not distinguishing himself , disappearing into the frenetic horror of from dusk till dawn and the inane vortex that was batman & robin . devoe displays an often ruthless military pragmatism , yet his very refusal to play politics gives many of his comic lines their bite . he's no bond , of course , which points out the one glaring deficiency keeping the peacemaker from being a great action film . the bond films' awareness of their own high-flying absurdity forced them to avoid self-importance , while also making it easy for viewers to overlook mediocre scripts . not only is michael schiffer's screenplay for the peacemaker too serious by half , it feels only half-finished . instead of an arrogantly megalomaniacal villain , or even an appealingly insane one , schiffer offers a somber , haunted bosnian surrounded by the somber , haunted ruins of sarajevo . leder adds a touch of irony with a passing shot of sarajevo's olympic rings , at least momentarily defusing the impression that the peacemaker is trying to make a political statement . as for the characters . . . let's just call them functional . there's a mechanical feel to the narrative flow of the peacemaker ; it moves from place to place or person to person with little connective tissue to hold it all together . it's an action machine , albeit an extremely well-oiled one . well-oiled action machines are rare enough that the peacemaker could find a receptive audience , perhaps the same audience anxiously awaiting james bond's next adventure . operating without a compelling script or the built-in goodwill which accompanies the planet's most famous secret agent , mimi leder and company manage to create a worthy challenger . with competition like bond , it's impressive that leder was neither shaken nor stirred . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1768,"director : mark waters . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , sexual situations , violence ) running time : 85 minutes . norman rockwell would not approve of what the movies are doing to thanksgiving . this fall , no fewer than three new releases -- the ice storm , the myth of fingerprints and the house of yes -- are turning turkey day into dysfunction junction . at least mark waters , screenwriter and director of the house of yes , seems to understand that the recrimination-filled holiday gathering has already become a film cliche . the house of yes is a black comedy not at all concerned about making its family feuds a touch surreal . the year is significant because it marks the 20th anniversary of the assassination of president kennedy , a date which holds even more significance for the pascals than for most americans . waters adapted the house of yes from a play by wendy macleod , and you can hear the theatrical roots in every line of dialogue . posey , prinze and bujold exchange clipped quips with the practiced air of a company in mid-run , lines building on top of one another at a dizzying pace . waters' direction also tends towards the conventional , usually holding the speaker in medium shot then shifting immediately to the next speaker . ordinarily , a production this uniformly stagy would feel forced and awkward on the screen , but not the house of yes . as it turns out , this is a story of overly dramatic people living a self-conscious soap opera . appropriately enough ( if unexpectedly ) , tori spelling delivers the film's most naturalistic performance ; the rest of this clan is like the addams family , so immersed in their own singularly demented world that they don't even see anything out of the ordinary . the script also keeps the wicked humor coming so regularly that you may not notice the arch deliveries ( or at least not mind them ) . the dialogue is fast , funny and quirky enough to defuse some touchy subject matter . for most of the film's running time , waters refuses to treat the pascals' family skeletons as tragedies . it's late in the film when the house of yes takes its most ill-advised turn , going exactly the somber and serious route it had so carefully side-stepped . the last shot in particular seems to ask for a careful psychological analysis , potentially rendering jackie-o as a guiltless , misunderstood victim . it's a jarring miscalculation which takes a satire of dysfunction dramas and turns it into something which leaves a dysfunction drama taste in your mouth . the house of yes should have stuck with what it was doing best : providing an alternative thanksgiving meal , something salty and bitter without a trace of saccharine . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1769,"screenplay : bart freundlich . director : bart freundlich . the myth of fingerprints is a subtle , restrained film in a genre crying out for a little subtlety and restraint . yet the myth of fingerprints isn't about raised voices , cathartic confrontations or healing embraces . many viewers might find the myth of fingerprints rather inconsequential in its paucity of fireworks and dirty laundry . it has become so commonplace for such stories to center on big revelations -- who confesses to being gay , who turns out to be a child molester , who's been unfaithful to whom ( or _with_ whom ) -- that it's almost disappointing when they're absent . neither are there many resolutions , with some relationships just as unstable at the fade-out as they were at the fade-in . bart freundlich's script is about relatively mundane familial discord , but it's expertly observed mundanity . if there is one major stumbling block in the myth of fingerprints , it's the lack of sufficient time to do justice to its broad canvas . freundlich has so many characters and so many relationships to cover that he inevitably short-changes some of them , perhaps even all of them . he's fortunate that he has such a stellar cast to fill in the spaces , particularly moore and davis . there is an ease to the way the characters interact , even in their uneasiness , which makes it easy to get caught up in the simple tensions . the confidence with which freundlich directs the myth of fingerprints practically forces you to concede that this story matters . to paraphrase tolstoy , every unhappy family is unhappy in its own unique way . this one happens to be unhappy quietly , but its an unhappiness worth exploring . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1770,"screenplay : ed neumeier , based on the novel by robert a . heinlein . director : paul verhoeven . mpaa rating : r ( violence , gore , nudity , sexual situations ) running time : 129 minutes . devotees of robert a . heinlein , be forewarned : paul verhoeven's starship troopers is less an adaptation of heinlein's novel than it is a literary satire . the author's jingo-all-the-way militarism and his tendency to create plastic characters with plastic conflicts had me expecting a soulless , faceless parade of carnage from the film version . and i suppose that's exactly what verhoeven delivers , with sometimes hilarious results . heinlein's basic motifs are so faithfully rendered that their flaws become a source of amusement , while their strengths become the stuff of high-energy entertainment . outlining the plot of starship troopers is a fairly silly endeavor , since it's basically a big bug hunt . . . aliens in broad daylight . so if starship troopers is another movie where one-dimensional characters wade through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of aliens , what makes it any better than , say , independence day , a movie where one-dimensional characters waded through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of slightly different aliens ? for one thing , you sense that the film-makers are aware of the pulp nonsense they have as source material . the very absence of major stars in the cast feels thematically appropriate , not just fiscally prudent . if starship troopers had been turned into a tv-movie , aaron spelling would have produced it . it's a story which requires emoting , not acting ; it's a prime time soap opera with big guns , played for all the dopey melodrama it's worth . the no-name cast also plays into verhoeven's treatment of heinlein's most controversial conceit . these characters really are just "" fresh meat for the grinder , "" as one character puts it , which makes their lack of familiarity all the more fitting . it's not that starship troopers is anti-military , because it never treats the true horror of war as anything but a great big , violent video game . verhoeven is actually having it both ways -- he's making fun of gung-ho boosterism even as he fires his fresh-faced recruits into battle on a gung-ho booster rocket of visual effects . if that makes starship troopers hypocritical , at least it's enthusiastically staged hypocrisy . there may not be a person worth caring about in the whole film , but it moves like nobody's business . verhoeven stages some thrilling action sequences , sending swarms of bugs after the anonymous grunts then having various body parts strewn about the screen like landscaping . it is that rare special effects blockbuster which demonstrates a sense of pacing to match its budget ; i was caught up in the action enough of the time that i wasn't perpetually groaning over the absence of real human beings . i wish i could find it in myself to work up more outrage over the callous way humans are dispatched in starship troopers , but it didn't work out that way . that would be punishing verhoeven for getting to the heart of his material . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1771,"the best documentaries manage to uncover truths deeper than their most obvious subjects ; the best documentarians recognize that they can use the film medium to tell stories as compelling as anything fictional . 4 little girls , a powerful tale of tragic loss turned into positive action , is more than the sort of "" talking head "" video textbook most people envision when they think of conventional documentaries . it is the work of a film-maker who knows how to provoke viewers while he educates them , who has experience examining the challenging subject of race in america . through photographs and interviews with family and friends , we come to know the four girls not merely as symbols , but as individuals , remembered fondly as vibrant lives cut short . 4 little girls creates a vivid portrait of alabama in the 1960s , rich with detailed characterizations which make it feel like lee always has his eye towards creating a narrative . for all the historical detail , lee never loses sight of the centerpiece of the film . it's unfortunate that lee follows those scenes with the indictment and trial of "" dynamite bob "" chambliss for the killings , by far the weakest sequence in the film . it may have provided a necessary closure to show the criminal eventually brought to justice , but 4 little girls is much more powerful detailing how this tragedy became a catalyst for change in the public perception of southern racism was affected around the world . lee also offers frightening comparisons to the recent spate of black church burnings in the south , highlighting his ability to make the film many things at once -- a memorial , a history lesson , an opportunity for healing , a warning to stay vigilant . 4 little girls is a gripping experience , an epic testament to triumph over hatred which never forgets the very personal loss of four families who still miss their four little girls . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1772,"screenplay : quentin tarantino , based on the novel "" rum punch "" by elmore leonard . producer : lawrence bender . director : quentin tarantino . a lot of those same folks are going to see jackie brown as a validation of their suspicions . after all , it's not the kind of dizzying , heart-stopping morality-play-disguised-as-nihilism pulp fiction was . both fans and foes of tarantino tend to fixate on his writing , but jackie brown may prove once and for all that the man is a remarkably talented film director . he does things with his camera that keep viewers off-balance , while avoiding the swooping ostentation of many young film-makers . at times , he will linger on a shot just after a character has moved out of frame ; at other times , he may shoot a conversation from behind the characters' backs . in one hilariously perfect scene , he uses complete darkness to build tension , complemented by an expertly handled split-screen to deliver the punch line . he directs a scene with such confidence that he can convince a viewer to follow wherever he's leading , because it always seems to be somewhere slightly unexpected . he's also got a gift for directing actors most directors will never have . in jackie brown , tarantino resurrects the careers of not one , but two forgotten actors of the 1970s . grier does fine work , but it's robert forster who breaks out of jackie brown with a superb performance . a veteran of b-grade cop shows like "" nakia "" and "" banyon , "" forster plays the world-weary cherry with natural charisma and a touching affection for jackie . in a cast full of heavy hitters like samuel l . jackson and robert deniro ( both of whom are also top-notch ) , grier and forster make an unexpected romance between two people past their hollywood-pretty prime funny , sexy and convincing . it's true that jackie brown includes plenty of familiar elements from previous tarantino efforts : bursts of unpredictable violence , twelve-letter profanities by the truck-load , non-linear narrative , creative use of old songs ( doing for "" strawberry letter #23 "" what reservoir dogs did for "" stuck in the middle with you "" ) . it's also true that jackie brown moves at the kind of measured pace which could have some tarantino fans tapping their toes with impatience . it's not an instant classic , just a sharp piece of entertainment with the kind of tightly-structured script you wish tarantino could teach to other writers . i found it hard not to smile virtually from start to finish in jackie brown -- not because it's constantly amusing , but because it's such a pleasure to be in the hands of someone who knows how to use the medium . even if it's an over-rated , plagiarizing flavor of the month like quentin tarantino . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1773,"screenplay : robert duvall . director : robert duvall . mpaa rating : pg ( adult themes , mild profanity , brief violence ) running time : 130 minutes . a moment of mild understatement : people of christian faith haven't fared well in film . when hollywood was still afraid to offend , christian characters were flawless , salt-of-the-earth folks ; later , as cinematic taboos vanished through the 60s and 70s , religion became a sure sign of either mental illness or hypocrisy . pentecostal minister euliss f . "" sonny "" dewey , the title character in the apostle , may be the most wonderfully complex christian character ever depicted on film , and every ounce of credit for that creation goes to robert duvall . duvall works wonders with sonny , depicting every possible facet of this complicated man's personality . if there's one major stumbling block in the apostle , it is that the other characters in the film exist entirely to react to sonny . while the performances are uniformly strong and naturalistic , the supporting players rarely seem to have lives of their own . duvall commits so much energy to making this one character completely real that he has little left to spend on anyone else . you may not end up minding all that much , since that one character becomes so fascinating . duvall has long been one of america's finest actors , but this is the kind of role into which he disappears most completely -- slightly roguish but unmistakably human souls like his roles in tender mercies and lonesome dove . when sonny gives his final sermon in the apostle , in a sequence which lingers and builds in intensity , you realize exactly what duvall is aiming at . ultimately , the apostle is a strange sort of character study , because sonny doesn't really change all that much . like most well-intentioned by imperfect people , he just keeps trying to be better . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1774,"screenplay : elaine may , based on the novel by anonymous . director : mike nichols . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 143 minutes . it's ironic that klein could tell a story about the effect of scandal-mongering on american politics only by creating a bit of scandal himself , that he could uncover a few brutal truths only by hiding a few . it's even more ironic that the film version of primary colors appears just as president clinton finds himself entangled in new scandals , virtually guaranteeing that most coverage of the film will both miss the point entirely and help make the film's point for it . primary colors isn't simply a chance to giggle at clinton's foibles without naming him . this is a story about giggling at foibles masquerading as serious news , about a political process which has become a seemingly endless cycle of mud-slinging and spin control because we continue to create an audience for it . in that sense , it's a very similar story to the recent wag the dog , though simultaneously more human and more cynical . does it matter that this man who wants to do so much for the country seems to be doing it one woman at a time ? do the ends of getting into office where you can do some good justify the means of slinging even more mud at the opponent than he slings at you ? and how can you make ideas worth anything in a culture where viewers watch an interview with the stantons and can only comment that susan "" should wear her hair longer . "" primary colors the movie manages to wrap all of the novel's tough questions and roman-a-clef characters into a surprisingly funny and entertaining package . though the running time of nearly 2-1/2 hours feels excessive near the end , director mike nichols crafts so many sharp comic scenes that the film never becomes a tedious political science lecture . he also gets one particularly dynamic performance from a generally solid cast -- kathy bates as libby , the stanton's borderline-loony long-time friend and the campaign's designated "" dust-buster "" ( because she's "" tougher than dirt "" ) . though the role initially seems like just a minor variation on bates' brassy , no-nonsense characters in dolores claiborne , the late shift or titanic , libby eventually develops into the real soul of primary colors : the last true idealist , a woman whose very sanity depends on the notion that there has to be a better way to select those who will lead us . of course , another performance will draw far more attention , which is precisely why primary colors couldn't possibly work as well on film as it does on the page . without a face , jack stanton is a complex and sympathetic character study representing a wide-spread problem . as effective as elaine may's script may be -- and travolta's performance , for that matter -- plenty of viewers will simply gape at primary colors in tabloid fascination , thinking of it as the bill clinton story . there's a sad lesson behind the laughs in primary colors , one you'll be able to spot in reviews and reactions colored by the lenses of intern-gate , grope-gate , or any other gate : we're getting exactly the leaders we deserve when we refuse to make their messages matter , and all we can do is throw up an endless series of gates in front of them . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

"" it's the whole idea of a "" guilty pleasure "" which love and death takes to task . when he launches into a tangent on film acting at a lecture , he may simply be swooning over ronnie , but he is also attacking a subject with a passion . as perfectly geared towards satire as the phony films-within-a-film may be ( complete with familiar grainy photography and credits like "" a huck murphy film "" ) , you're forced to move past mocking giggles to acknowledging the genuinely intense response de'ath feels . the credit for that belongs largely to john hurt , who gives a career performance . it's a role which must be perfectly pitched to be sympathetic , because de'ath is , to be frank , a celebrity stalker . hurt makes de'ath absolutely sincere , even if he is the only one who could possibly see greatness in ronnie . such epiphanies are too rare to restrict to the places we're _supposed_ to find epiphanies . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1776,"in an era of soaring stock markets , republican revolutions and enough backlashes to give you whiplash , michael moore is something of an anachronism : part stand-up comic , part guerrilla film-maker but always 100% old-school liberal . moore might be considered one of the most dangerous radicals in america if only you didn't want to giggle every time you saw him . his new documentary the big one is a hilariously unique piece of social commentary as vaudeville , a cross between "" 60 minutes "" and david letterman which draws most of its laughs from moore's mere presence . the confrontations which make up the backbone of the big one easily could have been humorless kamikaze journalism if not for the fact that it's michael moore holding the microphone . he has an agenda , to be sure , but he's also a splendid performer who makes it look easy drawing his flies with honey rather than vinegar . as entertaining as he may be in full concert mode -- describing how 1996 presidential candidate steve forbes never blinks ; explaining the role of "" shareholders "" in the u . s . constitution ; suggesting that our country change its name from the boring "" united states "" to the more intimidating "" the big one "" -- moore is at his best as the self-effacing goofball who ends up making others look like even bigger goofballs . if knight comes off looking like the devil -- and with his tim curry grin , he certainly looks the part -- it's not because he's acting in the economic best interest of his company . knight simply doesn't have the guts to come out with such an admission , a fact largely attributable to moore's preferred conversational style . it's rather foolish to accuse moore of blantant propagandizing , since he never bothers to hide the fact . occasionally he butts heads with recalcitrant company drones past the point of diminishing returns , and a couple of moments with "" average americans "" ( including a tearful session at a book signing ) appear either staged or needlessly like photo opportunities . still , it's hard to imagine that even the staunchest libertarian won't find something to smile at in moore's singular tapestry of 1990s americana . that goofy round-faced guy in the baseball cap sure knows how to make a lecture not seem like a lecture . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1777,"mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 113 minutes . first , this important preface : i love wings of desire . wim wenders' lyrical 1988 film , positing angels roaming through berlin and one particular angel fascinated with the human experience , caught me completely by surprise when i first saw it . it was less a narrative than a visual tone poem of division -- between heaven and earth , between monochrome and color , between east and west berlin -- which eventually finds unity . the experience , terribly un-critic-like though it may sound , was spiritually moving . that emotional response contributed significantly to me distaste for wenders' own ill-fated attempt at a sequel , faraway , so close ! ; it similarly led me to dread the impending arrival of the americanized re-make city of angels . why re-make perfection , especially to engage in the typical hollywood reductionism of making it all about the love story between the curious angel and his human object of desire ? perhaps it is because i expected so little that i was so improbably delighted by city of angels . though the decision to play up that relationship was certainly a practical one -- wings of desire's stream-of-consciousness eavesdropping hardly screams "" commercial "" -- it also gives city of angels its unique identity . the result is sort of a strange cousin to rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead -- a story based on existing characters and situations , yet thematically independent and appealing in its own right . much of that appeal springs from city of angels' commitment to its tone . few mainstream hollywood movies of recent years have been so willing to adopt a reflective pace , to paint broad canvases of human experience and allow us to watch in peace . while never earth-shaking , silberling's compositions are rarely predictable and frequently memorable . it's that rare big-screen movie that uses the big screen , allowing its intimate story to unfold in the grandeur of a massive city . ultimately , it's that intimate story which will win over viewers . cage and ryan make a superb romantic pair , each actor reaching for the longing in their respective characters and connecting that longing to the other . though cage may not be the most obvious choice for a role based on preternatural calm , the intensity percolating beneath his benevolent glances heightens the anticipation of his possible "" fall "" to humanity . few quibbles about the characters matter , however , when they share the screen ; the sheer force of their eye contact is often enough to wipe away any doubts about their feelings . a story about life-changing emotion is a hard sell to cynical audiences , but cage and ryan sell it . for all its meaphysical musings , there's never any question that city of angels is an old-style hollywood love story , a multi-hanky weeper light years removed from the dream-like wings of desire . it's almost enough to make you forget that angels is based on wings . . . which , for my money , is the best thing that possibly could have happened . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1780,"since time immemorial -- memorial day 1996 , to be precise -- one question has plagued movie-goers the world over : what might mission : impossible have looked like if someone had shown the faintest interest in telling a coherent story ? as answer , i give you ronin , an international espionage thriller fueled by as much brain power as adrenaline . the comparison to mission : impossible is almost too easy , especially given the presence of jean reno in both casts , but it's a telling comparison nonetheless . ronin shows how much more effective a film can be when set pieces are connected by ideas . as the operation begins , alliances quickly shift with the prevailing winds , no lofty ideal more important than the exigencies of the moment . that notion both drives the film and provides its title . mission : impossible flirted with the same concept , but it was to turn characters into vengeance-driven super-villains . the characters are sketched in only the most basic terms , in keeping with their private natures , yet they are given presence by actors like deniro and reno bringing mournful weight to their performances . though few words are spoken in the script by j . d . zeik and richard weisz ( a . k . a . david mamet ) , the very lack of human interaction between the characters speaks volumes . for a fairly introspective film , ronin is also a fairly exciting one . director john frankenheimer goes to the car chase well perhaps once too often , but those he uses are tense and well-constructed . the action level is as high in ronin as it has been in any summer blockbuster of the last few years , and it's _better_ action , more white-knuckle gripping than whoop-it-up flashy . for some viewers , that may be reason enough to spend two hours at the movies , but it's all the more impressive because the action serves the story . every subsequent violent encounter raises the stakes in this chaotic world , while it's always clear that the combatants neither know nor care what they're fighting for . ronin certainly has its share of jagged edges , notably the aforementioned opening titles and a distracting romantic sub-plot between deniro and mcelhone . some may find the characters too remote and under-developed , and consequently find it difficult to invest emotionally in the story . i found the chilly isolation of the characters exactly what ineeded to become emotionally invested ; the emptiness of their lives and actions _is_ the hook . this isn't earth-shaking profundity we're talking about , merely the building blocks of effective drama -- the visceral coupled with the intellectual , actions with consequences . consequences were never really an issue in mission : impossible , which makes it that much easier to appreciate what ronin has to offer . it's no longer a james bond landscape of world domination . for once , evil in an espionage thriller isn't what people do , but why they do it . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1781,"people will probably misinterpret the documentary out of the past as much as the controversial event which is at its center , which is irony enough . it would be even more ironic if they misinterpret it in exactly the same way : without any direct knowledge , because they are already convinced they know what it's about . such tends to be the case when you are dealing with the perpetually volatile subject of homosexuality . it happens even more frequently when the suggestion is proferred that gays and lesbians are human beings with much to contribute to the world . its purpose , according to peterson , was understanding -- understanding between gay students that they were not going through the difficult experience alone , understanding between gay and straight students that gays were not aliens to be feared or hated . that story alone would be compelling enough to make for a solid piece of documentary film-making . peterson emerges as a determined , remarkably mature young woman with a surprisingly wry sense of humor about the uproar she never meant to cause . it's fascinating and entertaining simply watching her calm determination in the face of parents who announce their concerns in board meetings that exposure to homosexuality will be a dangerous influence on impressionable teenagers . they desire nothing less than the invisibility of homosexuals , believing perhaps that if no one talks about them , they will simply go away . that widely-held societal belief drives even more fascinating secondary story in out of the past -- a series of biographical vignettes intertwined with kelli peterson's struggle . like many "" talking head "" documentaries , out of the past does have its slow patches , and not all the biographical sketches are uniformly enlightening . ultimately , however , the film does what it sets out to do : it places kelli peterson in a historical context , validating the legacy which she had been denied . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1782,"screenplay : charles leavitt , based on the novel _freak the mighty_ by rodman philbrick . director : peter chelsom . mpaa rating : pg ( mild profanity , adult themes ) running time : 95 minutes . the resulting film was mawkish and erratic , sacrificing strong and consistent characterizations for cheap slapstick and even cheaper melodrama . i love the cosmic symmetry that allows me to point out exactly what's right about one film because of what went wrong in another . yet the mighty is superior to simon birch in almost every way . it's a family film about triumph over adversity that earns honest emotional response . you might expect the mighty to be just a glorified "" afterschool special , "" unless you knew the work of director peter chelsom . the auteur behind the eccentric gems hear my song and funny bones gives the story a fantastic flair , with images of the symbiotic duo crossing swords with enemies in their flights of fancy . even the scenes clearly designed to draw cheers , including a gym class basketball game , somehow seem too surreal to be manipulative . the mighty has more than its share of messages , yet it rarely feels like a "" message movie . "" it has more than its share of shifts in tone , yet it rarely feels inconsistent . give credit both to chelsom and to his two young leads , who deliver a pair of superb performances . kieran culkin ( yes , _his_ younger brother ) finds the fine line between intelligent and obnoxious -- a line most young actors trample into dust -- to make kevin an appealing protagonist . elden henson , however , provides the film's real emotional core as the deeply troubled max . ably assisted by restrained , dignified supporting turns from stone , rowlands and stanton , culkin and henson create a solid dramatic foundation . the sub-plot's darker tone , involving murder and kidnapping , are challenging enough to fit into a family film without gandolfini playing the role as a leering monster . yet even then chelsom rallies to give us a potent climax without an ounce of fat . the power of the story , and its convincing bonds of friendship , make teary-eyed actors and sweeping musical cues utterly unnecessary . the mighty builds two characters worth caring about . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1783,"screenplay : robert benigni and vincenzo cerami . producers : elda ferri and gianluigi braschi . director : roberto benigni mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes ) running time : 114 minutes . life is beautiful , a fancifully dark italian comedy from co-writer/director/star roberto benigni , has inspired one of the most misguided criticisms of recent years . the criticism leveled at life is beautiful is that it is a sanitized version of the holocaust , which somehow diminishes the gravity of the tragedy by squeezing humor from it . the absurdity of that criticism is that it seems to miss the point entirely . benigni crafts a sensitive relationship between the father and son , as guido's wit and imagination allow him to create a world of pleasure and hope where no pleasure or hope should be possible . there are more than enough grim reminders of the camp's true purpose -- as well as a glimpse of banal evil in the character of an obliviously self-absorbed physician ( horst buchholz ) -- to dismiss any notion that benigni as a film-maker is candy-coating one of the bleakest chapters in human history . the irony of that misguided criticism is that there's a much simpler reason to be less than dazzled by life is beautiful -- namely , most of the first hour . in essence , it's an _extremely_ extended prologue , introducing us to guido as a carefree seeker of love and fortune who directs his creative energies towards winning dora's heart . the pleasant scenes between them certainly establish their bond , as well as guido's imaginative gifts , but on their own they're fairly innocuous bits of romantic tomfoolery . benigni mixes physical comedy with the occasional social commentary , all with moderate success and the sense that he's just passing time until he can get to the real meat of the story . it's easy to imagine benigni setting up all the necessary relationships in about half the time , making the shift in tone less abrupt . . . and making shifting in your seat less necessary . none of that detracts from the potent , bittersweet pleasures of the film's second half . all of the things that could have gone wrong instead go right -- the young cantarini radiates charming innocence without cloying self-awareness ; benigni hits just the right balance between clown and unlikely hero ; the darker moments always feel consistent with the human comedy . life is beautiful grows richer by the minute , making it easy to forgive the amiable but meandering first half . if it hadn't takeng quite so long to reach its most powerful scenes , life is beautiful would have been an easy choice as one of the year's best films . an expression as trite as "" triumph of the human spirit "" doesn't quite do justice to what benigni has pulled off here . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1784,"a couple of years ago , i began reading scott smith's novel a simple plan and never made it to the halfway point . there was nothing particularly wrong with the plot -- a moody cautionary tale about the resulting spiral of guilt and violence when three men find $4 . 4 million in a wrecked plane -- nor did smith's prose style offend in any way . it seemed to me a terrible mistake , one made identification with one specific character too explicit . intriguing though the premise may have been , i couldn't get past hearing hank mitchell's voice while watching his story unfold . sam raimi's screen version of a simple plan shows how easy it can be to improve on a novel when point-of-view is its only real flaw . only there is harm done . a simple plan offers an object lesson in any number of cliched moral bon mots : crime doesn't pay , there certainly isn't any honor among thieves , and love of money is indeed the root of all evil . it's a tale of what we're made of at our core , and how little it takes to strip away the civilization in a man like hank and turn him into a savage . that probably doesn't sound like the kind of material one usually associates with raimi ( the evil dead , darkman ) , a director whose camera often seems to need a dose of ritalin . he certainly tones down his hyperkinetic visuals , but he loses none of his energy , which is why a simple plan never feels like a simplistic morality play . he merely harnesses that energy into scenes of superbly crafted tension , where the moments before critical decisions linger with almost unbearable anticipation . raimi allows you to feel the weight of every bad choice , every life-threatening turning point . it's a thriller as full of genuine dread as anything a major studio has produced in recent years . it's also a thriller full of genuine pathos , thanks to a masterful supporting performance by billy bob thornton . as confused as he is physically grotesque , he provides the sense of emotional consequence most plot-driven thrillers lack . the one drawback to thornton's intense work is that he makes his castmates look weak by comparison ; bridget fonda's calculating sarah rings particularly false at times . a simple plan overreaches its grasp a bit during the final act when a sinister figure arrives to threaten the plan , but by then raimi and smith have gotten you so wrapped up in what their characters will do next that you're willing to follow wherever they lead . smith's first-person narrative in written form made this a tale of one man's descent . on the screen , a simple plan lets you identify with every character and experience the chilly , chilling dark night of several souls . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1785,"screenplay : philip lazebnik . producers : penny finkelman cox and sandra rabins . mpaa rating : pg ( adult themes ) running time : 97 minutes . there's precaution , and then there's what dreamworks has done to insure that the prince of egypt would not become a lightning rod for controversy . religious leaders were consulted on early drafts of the script ; word went forth that this would be a serious , respectful dramatic film with no disney-style animals for comic relief . the film-makers even attached an opening disclaimer about "" artistic license "" taken with the story , which also referred viewers to the book of exodus for the biblical story of moses . the public relations message has been strong and consistent : befitting its subject matter , the prince of egypt would be a different sort of animated film . in some very important ways , that message was completely accurate . while god is certainly present in the film , the religious elements have been subsumed to the human elements . it's a tricky element to introduce -- that we should care about a personal tragedy in this tale of god's commitment to the hebrews -- but it works to give the film the feel of a mature drama rather than just another animated fairy tale . with such a strong foundation , it becomes distracting when the prince of egypt adopts the rhythms and songs of a typical animated musical . stephen schwartz's tunes are generally solid , but it becomes too easy to think of the film as nothing special when the structure ventures into such familiar territory . there's no need for a biblical epic to turn into "" les miserables , "" or the old testament equivalent of "" jesus christ superstar "" , particularly when the images unaccompanied by music are so compelling . there's enough story to this story , and enough vision to the animation , not to require a tune every 10 minutes . in a way , the inclusion of musical numbers could have been an attempt to make the prince of egypt a transitional form of feature animation . it was no surprise to find a screening audience filled with children ; it was , however , something of a surprise to notice them so engaged in such a somber , challenging story . perhaps the songs , and the occasional flashes of humor , served to ease younger viewers into something not so far removed from the videos that line their parents' shelves . dreamworks tackled an incredibly challenging task in the prince of egypt , the task of turning scripture into family entertainment . it's about as successful a conclusion to that task as i can imagine , one which combines tradition and imagination into a powerful animated experience . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1786,"there's more than a touch of irony to the title of the last days , the first feature film project from steven spielberg's shoah foundation . it's this concern with the world of the survivors -- rather than simply the world of the concentration camp internees -- that makes the last days more than "" just another holocaust documentary . "" the film is told entirely by witnesses to the holocaust , without a moment of narration , yet accounts of attrocities in the camps make up a relatively small portion of the film . there are certainly many powerful recollections in the survivor testimony , the kind that can make you cry out in pain . director james moll also uncovers rare footage for which no adjectives will suffice , images shot by liberating allied forces of skeletal survivors walking in a ghostly parade . if there is anywhere it disappoints , it is in capturing the uniqueness of this particular "" before . "" bill basch ruefully notes in the film's opening moments the absurdity of hitler's late push to add the hungarian jews to his european slaughter -- "" killing jews , "" basch says , "" was more important than winning the war "" -- but moll doesn't build on that premise . while his focus on the survivors keeps the story personal , it doesn't allow for a perspective on what was happening in the bigger picture of 1944 , and how a different allocation of resources by the germans might have changed that picture . accounts of how hungarians believed the stories drifting in from poland could never happen in their own country feel more like generic back-story than a context for this particular phase of the genocide . there is still 35 minutes of screen time left when the war ends , leaving us with stories of our five narrators trying to pick up the pieces . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1787,"screenplay : john august . director : doug liman . in this cinematic era a . q . we just can't seem to help ourselves -- when we're not noting ways tarantino has cribbed from his film-making forebears , we're noting the ways his acolytes have cribbed from him . when a film like go appears , so like pulp fiction in both narrative structure and style , it's easy to dismiss it on a comparative basis without discussing why the tarantino oeuvre has become the greenwich mean time for an entire genre -- the edgy , after-hours comic thriller . it's easy to miss why director doug liman's film works in the ways it understands tarantino's unique touch , and doesn't work in the ways it fails to understand . like pulp fiction , go involves several non-chronological yet intertwined stories of los angeles denizens with less than glowing morals . there's something to be said for a film with the ability to grab you viscerally , which is one of the tricks go manages to pull off . that description isn't just about pacing ( though go moves with the hypnotic momentum of a rave beat ) , nor is it just about the level of violence and action ( though there's one kicker of a car chase through vegas ) . like the most memorable moments in pulp fiction , the most memorable moments in go energize you with the sense that you're really not sure what's going to happen next . at key junctures , you realize that screenwriter john august is in complete command of his narrative as he turns expectations upside down in ways that make perfect sense , not just because he can . that's not to say that go doesn't wander off on tangents just because they might prove to be entertaining . like much of tarantino's work , it's a loose and sloppy sort of a film , which doesn't mean that there's no logic to what's going on . it's just the logic of giving an audience one heck of a ride , letting the characters stroll and stray because the film-makers have created an atmosphere where we trust they'll stroll somewhere interesting . unlike much of tarantino's work , however , there's not much going on beneath the glittering surface of go . the closest it gets to a thematic link is the idea that these young people dash into dangerous situations with little restraint on their desire to . . . well , to go . there's nothing resembling the moral center of pulp fiction , nor do august and liman show nearly as much affection for their flawed , self-absorbed characters . the performances are solid even when the chattery dialogue feels a bit forced , giving us plenty of reason to follow the characters even when they seem like hopeless screw-ups , but no one is experiencing a fundamental life change . go is a dazzling demonstration of how good even a derivative sort of film can be when someone grasps the basic principles of engrossing film-making . it also demonstrates what we talk about when we talk about tarantino -- a way of telling us something about humanity between the bursts of dialogue and gunfire . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1788,"screenplay : anne rapp . producers : robert altman and etchie stroh . director : robert altman . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 117 minutes . apparently he decided he hadn't yet explored it in all possible depth , because he's back in dixie for cookie's fortune . the region's easy rhythms and idiosyncracies seem to suit the film-maker well , and he seems to be having a heck of a good time with his visits there . cookie's fortune finds altman laying down a blues jam of intertwining characters spiced with a deft , dry comic touch into a surprising , off-beat entertainment . cookie's fortune is probably most easily summarized as a southern spin on fargo's tale of polite , common-sense police investigation , but that doesn't entirely capture the film's quirky rhythms . yet even as camille's plans begin to unravel , cookie's fortune is less about the suspense and tension of guilt exposed than it is about the pleasures of watching it meander to its inevitable conclusion . as it is in many altman films , the plot -- well-constructed as it is by anne rapp -- works best as a place for a handful of appealing performances to unfold . and there are certainly plenty of appealing performances , of which close's is only the most gaudy . even chris o'donnell , so often an attractive blank hole as an actor , acquits himself well in the ideal role of a puppydog-eager-to-please deputy . fortunately she's a rare false note in altman's smooth orchestration . cookie's fortune is the kind of unconventional narrative of lingering takes that may leave some viewers shifting in their seats waiting for the point of it all . for altman , in this particular case , taking the time to get to the point is actually part of the point . it's a comedy of details dropped in almost off-handedly , and others -- a hand literally caught in the cookie jar , for instance -- underlined at just the right moment . it doesn't add up to all that much either as character study or as crime drama , nor does it take the straightest path between any two points . it's merely a lazy , crazy , consistently amusing diversion about a place where you only know the true measure of a man ( or a woman ) after you've gone fishing together . it's a place altman might consider visiting more often . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1789,"director : alexander payne . this is how i know i'm dealing with a film of uncommon intelligence : election resists the tidy summations in which most films are all-too-eager to wrap themselves . like many recent films , it is a comedy set in a high school , but it's more than just the latest high school comedy . it deals with a student body election , but it's not really _about_ a student body election . it's a film in which characters narrate much of the story , but it doesn't use that narration in a conventional way . like director alexander payne's previous film citizen ruth -- if to a somewhat less successful degree -- election is a satirical scalpel that refuses to let you know exactly when or whom it's going to cut . it would have been easy enough for election to turn into a broad comedy about adolescent peer politics , and it _still_ would have been more insightful than most teen comedies . payne and co-writer jim taylor , working from tom perrotta's novel , have bigger targets in mind . tracy flick's campaign casts her as a political cousin of our current president , seeking election as a "" you really like me "" validation rathern than out of a desire to serve ; even her nomination speech parrots the naming-of-names , i-feel-your-pain personal touch . even the ridiculous posters , filled with little more than sloganeering , seem disturbingly similar to national election campaigning . it's savvy , cynical , and very funny . even more effective is payne's use of that old literary device the "" unreliable narrator "" as counterpoint to his direction . only paul , perhaps too dense to be duplicitous , seems pure of heart . as he did in citizen ruth , payne explores the way we convince ourselves that our motivations are pure , even when we don't really understand what our motivations are . if payne stumbles anywhere , it's in his choice to focus much of the film's second half on mcallister's domestic troubles . but election is too smart to be derailed by this problem , too clear-eyed in its study of good intentions muddled by psychological baggage . with surprising sympathy towards all his flawed characters , alexander payne creates a furiously funny film in which his surrealistic directing touches keep the audience off-guard . he understands that in a world where people can't even summarize themselves in a neat-and-tidy sentence , we can't expect to summarize the movies about them that way . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1790,"not to be glib , but there are two very simple reasons why so many romantic comedies are so bad : 1 ) no romance ; 2 ) no comedy . the structure is so simple it could be banged out by monkeys -- find two characters , put them together , introduce an obstacle , tear them apart , resolve the obstacle , bring them back together again . that's where every romantic comedy script begins , and sadly , that's also where most of them end . see , there's the not-so-small matter of creating two likeable characters whose pairing is as plausible as their separation , as well as entertaining the audience along the way to the foregone conclusion . when your audience is ready and willing to be charmed , a film's inability to generate wit or warmth is inexcusable . anna , the hounded subject of perpetual press coverage , is understandably guarded ; william , though a bit dazzled , is understated in his treatment of the star . the romantic side of notting hill works most effectively because curtis and director roger michell ( persuasion ) allow it to develop in stages . crackling with chemistry together , both stars give assured , engaging performances while still leaving a few rough edges -- anna's prickly preoccupation with the perils of her fame , william's addiction to the "" love heroin "" of his romance with a star . it's convenient that the writer who can put these romantic developments together is also one of the finest comedy writers working . curtis -- a co-creator of both the wonderfully wordy "" blackadder "" and the purely physical "" mr . bean -- has always had an impressive comic range . the solid supporting cast , including tim mcinnerny , hugh bonneville and emma chambers , comes through with appealing work , but it's curtis' wicked way with a line or a visual gag that keeps the comic energy high . notting hill does make the mistake of clocking in at a heavy 125 minutes , dragging out its denouement to an unnecessarily tortuous degree . in fact , there are several occasions where the editing seems disjointed , with odd cutaways and dialogue beginning too early . the technical glitches are perhaps more notable in a film which spins its romance unabashedly into a confection that's pure hollywood , and not just because one of the characters is a hollywood star . this is romantic comedy in an old-fashioned sense , where the pleasures come more from a zestful staging than from foolish details like whether the relationship is "" realistic .

1791,"screenplay : erick zonca and roger bohbot . director : erick zonca . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , sexual situations , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 112 minutes . many films have traced the arc of a romantic relationship in which the two principals , despite initial appearances that they are a perfect pair , are destined never to be happy together . the dreamlife of angels is the first film i can recall which traces the arc of a platonic friendship in the same terms . sparked by two superb performances in complex roles , it's as affecting and involving as any tale in which the doomed couple are romantic partners instead of pals . the dynamic between the two central characters works from the outset only because they are so carefully , beautifully drawn by erick zonca and roger bohbot . their playful irreverence makes for some entertaining scenes , and allows the two lead actresses to develop a believable chemistry . that kind of chemistry is critical to a story about a relationship -- if isa and marie don't seem like ideal best friends when they first get acquainted , the rest of the dreamlife of angels becomes utterly irrelevant . it's just as important that the appearance of an ideal pairing proves deceiving , and the film works just as well revealing that truth . the character study of the dreamlife of angels is so strong that it's easier to overlook its short-comings : a drawn-out prologue before the two women meet , under-developed supporting characters , and a third act which takes an unnecessarily melodramatic turn . zonca's minimalist direction never gets in the way of the performances , but it also does little to complement them . in fact , the story might have worked even better as a two-character stage play . that's not to take anything away from the effectiveness of those characters in the film , or the skilled actresses who bring them to life . it's a thoroughly compelling exploration of female bonding and un-bonding , a "" chick flick "" turned on its head . the disintegration of a friendship has rarely felt quite so tragic . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1792,"trick is one of those rare gay romantic comedies that passes the "" straight test .

"" when a director can turn spelling into a gifted comic actress , you know he's a talent to watch for . i suppose the reason trick is even more appealing than its laugh value is that it does more with a gay relationship than any film i can remember . that's probably because it isn't _just_ about a gay relationship . the developing relationshp between gabriel and mark works the way all good romantic relationships work , exploring the way people discover surprisingly wonderful things about each other when they least expect it . the fact that the relationship develops in the midst of such entertaining comedy is a delightful bonus . the obstacles thrown in their way do begin to feel a bit contrived , but you may be having too much fun to notice . trick is so effortlessly charming , i may just change the name of the "" straight test "" to the "" trick test .

1794,"starring : daniel day-lewis , michelle pfeiffer , winona ryder . screenplay : jay cocks and martin scorsese . director : martin scorsese . viewers of the age of innocence will likely fall into one of two camps : those who consider it a minor masterpiece , and those who consider it a huge bore . there is something to be said for both sides . director martin scorsese has crafted a sumptuous and dazzling visual feast from edith wharton's novel of social propriety and repressed desire , but one that suffers from an overlong second act and a lack of character depth . while still an exceptional film experience , it is ultimately one which i found much more engaging intellectually than emotionally . the age of innocence is a tale of surfaces , of a society concerned with the appearance of things rather than the reality . scorsese captures this obsession with surfaces by letting his camera dwell on things rather than people ; calling cards , watch fobs , earrings and table settings all become icons of status and civility . it's a fascinating anthropological study , highlighted by typically bravura scorsese moments , including a piercingly insightful tour through one house during a formal ball . yet for all its virtuosity , i found the age of innocence working essentially as a documentary , not the forbidden love story which is at its core . scorsese is so good at establishing the framework , that he has little time left for the characters . they are kept at a distance , which may in part be the point but left me a bit cold . the performers are not to be held responsible for these shortcomings . he carries himself as though he is constantly on the brink of exploding but knows that it is impossible to do so . miriam margolyes is delightful as may's eccentric and knowing granny mingott , but the rest of the cast is forced to do what it can with roles which essentially function as archer's obstacles ; they are not really characters in their own right . however , the film's technical credits alone make it required viewing . longtime scorsese collaborator thelma schoonmaker does a glorious editing job , and even gets her name on a billboard in the film . cinematographer michael ballhaus takes some stunning and instantly memorable shots , including an ocean panorama which looks like a painting . elmer bernstein's score is lush and evocative , and the costume and production design are certain oscar nominees . the age of innocence demonstrates yet again that martin scorsese could direct "" dick and jane "" into a visual spectacle . it's a fascinating examination of lifeless and soulless time , and my attention never waned . but i kept finding myself oddly detached , wanting to care more about whether or not archer and ellen would find happiness together but never quite able to do so . there is so much to admire about the age of innocence that it seems like nitpicking , but i'm funny that way : i want to be caught up in love stories .

"" that sequence in magnolia is one of the year's best pieces of film-making , and i could name a dozen more moments from the film that will be sticking in my memory . if anderson had pulled all those pieces of film-making together into a stronger whole , magnolia might have been the year's best film , instead of just a very good one . it's certainly an ambitious work , following many characters through one rainy day in the san fernando valley . in a way , the whole thing is little more than an extended attempt to justify the film's most surreal device ( more on which later ) . it's also undeniably compelling , charged by anderson's kitchen sink visual style . and for three hours , that's what magnolia does : it delivers thrilling scene after thrilling scene which , by all rights , should simply feel self-indulgent . when anderson nails these characters at their most vulnerable and conflicted , he creates sensational scenes for actors . magnolia plays like a cross between a symphony and a jazz jam , with solo showcases building toward splendidly edited crescendos . the only thing missing is an anchor , something that ties anderson's multiple story lines together in a way that makes them greater than the sum of their parts . and yes , sins of the fathers play a role in most of the characters' lives . it's obvious anderson wants us to feel a connection . i just don't think he pulls it off , giving more attention to the individual trespasses and recriminations than to the links between them . there's sure to be much talk about anderson's most audacious attempt to pull his story together , a cloudburst in which something besides rain falls from the sky in a torrent . i'm not about to guess what anderson was thinking by loosing a biblical plague upon the san fernando valley , nor will i pretend the credulity-stretching trick doesn't feel more like a grand gag than a dramatic fulcrum . there's also something about it that just plain works -- maybe just as damn-the-torpedoes film-making , maybe as acknowledgement of how primal forces can throttle you into re-evaluating your life . that , in a nutshell , is the wonderful frustration of magnolia . part of you wants to expose anderson as a philosophical poseur , and the other half can't stop watching everything he throws at the screen . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1797,"and that's the good news . this is the first directorial effort by peter mccarthy , producer of such films as repo man and tapeheads , and those credits should tell you all you need to know about the style and tone of floundering . it's a hilariously surreal examination of urban paranoia and hopelessness , filled with oddball characters , goofy stream-of-consciousness narrative and instantly quotable lines . floundering is told through a voiceover narration by john , but it's not so much about john as it is about the chaotic world around him . john is only the tour guide , but his observations are wonderfully off-the-wall : on the destruction in south central l . a . : "" maybe we should leave it as a reminder . . . then [peter] ueberroth will turn it into a riot theme park . "" on romance : "" true love is the ultimate fiction . . . if mccarthy's script is rich with such moments . unfortunately , it's also rich with heavy-handed left-wing moralizing which could easily turn off those with differing points of view . it's therefore very fortunate that so many of the other minor roles are so funny . the snapshots taken by his mental camera provide a bitingly satirical collage of urban life , but surprisingly mccarthy doesn't opt for utter cynicism . instead , he manages to balance black-humored sarcasm and social commentary with an ultimately optimistic message of personal responsibility . for those who enjoy their comedy with an edge and don't mind the occasional preaching , there's a real winner to be found in floundering . besides , how can you not love a film that ends with two guitarists , one black and one white , singing a marvelously off-key duet of "" ( what's so funny 'bout ) peace , love and understanding ?

1798,"screenplay : scott alexander and larry karaszewski . director : milos forman . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , brief nudity , adult themes ) running time : 118 minutes . in the first moments of man on the moon's splendidly inventive prologue , jim carrey says , "" hello . . . i am andy . "" there is no way to describe carrey's performance as andy kaufman in milos forman's bio-pic except to say that carrey inhabits kaufman . carrey's work may be the best , most effective extended impression in film history . the astonishing thing about man on the moon is how entertaining it is despite the fact that there's very little to it but carrey's extended impression . there's just the small matter of kaufman's insistence on pushing himself , his act and his audience farther than they've ever gone before . hard to take , perhaps , but impossible to ignore . it's also impossible to deny that man on the moon owes most of its entertainment value to kaufman himself , since the film's biggest laughts come from re-creations of kaufman's outrageous performances . kaufman responds with a reading in its entirety of _the great gatsby_ . watching carrey-as-kaufman reach for the edges without anything resembling a net is exhilarating . kaufman's routines still have the ability to inspire gasping laughter . the script by scott alexander and larry karaszewski casts a similar rosy glow over its subject as their scripts for ed wood and the people vs . larry flynt , making the film more of an homage to driven eccentricity than piercing character study . it may be true , as kaufman's girlfriend lynne ( courtney love ) says to him in one scene , that "" there is no real you , "" but that doesn't make the absence of insight any less disapppointing . while man on the moon's performance set pieces are dazzling , in a sense they never end . it's a portrait of an entire life lived as performance art , when you keep hoping for at least a glimpse behind the curtain . there are moments during the film's final half hour , when kaufman is coping with cancer -- and with the boy-who-cried-wolf repercussions as his friends and family doubt that he is really sick -- that we begin to see a self-aware andy . in one of the film's best moments , a trip to a philippine "" psychic surgery "" clinic becomes an ironic revelation that attempts to delude others can go too far . with just a few more moments like that , man on the moon might have been a classic film biography . maybe ultimately it's just a showpiece -- for kaufman's decades-ahead-of-his-time genius , and for carrey's dynamic rendering of that genius . maybe it's just a grand illusion without an easily-understood human being behind it . and maybe , in a story about the life of andy kaufman , that's perfectly appropriate . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1799,"screenplay : robert altman and frank barhydt . director : robert altman . point #1 : raymond carver purists might be extremely disappointed in what robert altman has done to some of the best short stories written in the english language . the interlocking story structure of short cuts does not serve those stories well , and the small pathos of carver's pacific northwest isn't the same in altman's los angeles . point #2 : short cuts stands independently as a splendid film achievement , a brutally funny collection of fragments from broken lives crafted by a director with renewed vitality . only an abiding cynicism and the uneven appeal of the nine main stories mar this dynamic , poetic work . short cuts is about those moments when individuals are at their most basic , naked and vulnerable . indeed , nakedness and scatology play a key role in the film , perhaps more than some viewers might find palatable . characters in short cuts pop zits , break wind , urinate into streams , talk bluntly about sexuality and wander around in various states of undress , but none of these elements ever seem gratuitous . in one of the film's most memorable moments , julianne moore stands before husband matthew modine making a painful confession , with evidence that she is a natural redhead in full view . this is a film loaded with individual moments that slam home with the intensity of reality recognized , and frequently inspire nervous laughter . while the structure serves a purpose in emphasizing a great tapestry of lives , the impact of carver's individual stories is largely lost . it's true that i'm criticizing the film short cuts is not rather than the film it is , but it just seems a shame that such rich source material is given such a cursory treatment . altman never seems to identify with his own characters the way carver did , and as a result it seems he's laughing at them and not with them . opinions will vary as to which stories worked best . at over three hours , short cuts is anything but boring . it's a sharp , clever , perceptive look at life in the big city that goes for the jugular rather than the heartstrings . these short cuts are somewhat cold cuts , but they're mighty tasty .

1800,"if you want big emotions , you want steven spielberg ; if it's understated sentimentality you're looking for , you call tony bill . from 1980's my bodyguard through the recent untamed heart , bill has demonstrated a skill with emotional stories that steer clear of maudlin excess . as one who enjoys feeling without feeling manipulated , i find that a pretty neat trick . a home of our own is an extremely appealing low-key family drama , driven by kathy bates' rock-solid lead performance , which adds to bill's growing resume of restrained character pieces . a home of our own plays a lot like an impoverished "" wonder years , "" with its 1960s setting and wry retrospective narration , but unlike that series the voice-over is rarely intrusive and doesn't draw the focus away from frances . bates is near perfect , a presence that commands respect ; one is hard-pressed to think of another actor who would be as convincing as a sane mother of six . her slightly weathered features convey years of struggle , but she maintains an earthy good humor and a relentless optimism borne of necessity . that kathy bates gives a great performance can't be considered much of a surprise . what is a pleasant surprise is a home of our own's realistic portrayal of family life in hardship . with the exception of edward furlong , the lacey children are played by first-time actors , and they are quite natural . scenes are filled with petty squabbles , but beneath them all is a kind of solidarity which never seems mock-heroic . there is a level of love and mutual respect in the interaction which frankly threw me . it's not often that a movie does an american family this kind of justice . like most of tony bill's work , a home of our own is best when it's quietly observant . young actors tend to get into a lot of trouble when they're asked to yell , or to deliver lines like , "" you care more about the house than you do about us , "" and this is no exception . the film also trips when it spends too much time away from kathy bates , such as a tacked-on sequence involving furlong's first date . i was a bit disappointed in the inspirational finale , which loses some of the integrity points that home had accrued . i wish the filmmakers had done less with furlong's character and more with his , the one through whom we can see the family's struggle with somewhat objective eyes . "" wholesome "" is a word that usually inspires derision , but i couldn't be more complimentary when i say that a home of our own is a wholesome , subtly emotional film , well-acted and skillfully directed .

1801,"starring : kevin costner , clint eastwood , t . j . screenplay : john lee hancock . director : clint eastwood . let's face it , kevin costner hasn't become one of the most popular movie stars in the world because he can act the hell out of a part . sure , he's been charming enough in light fare like silverado and bull durham , but he's done little to prove that his ideal dramatic role wasn't as the corpse in the big chill . it therefore might not seem to mean much to say that a perfect world features costner's best all-around performance yet , and indeed it's nothing earth-shattering . however , it's more than solid , and coupled with an impressive turn by 7-year-old t . j . lowther creates a haunting story that packs a real punch even through its superfluous subplot . it seems in the early stages that he's setting up a parallel , or is interested in creating a hunter-hunted conflict a la the fugitive , but neither reall proves true . instead we get cliche'd characters in cliche'd conflicts . there's an icy fed to get on red's nerves , and plenty of pithy good ol' boy wisdom dispensed . eastwood and dern toss off token lines of good-natured antagonism , but neither one is interesting enough to make their story at all significant . a tighter , potentially classic drama might have come from chopping their segments entirely , because the main plot is a gem . the relationship between butch haynes and philip perry is one of the most unique and interesting explored in recent years . while at first glance butch might seem to be a simple "" victim of a negative environment "" type , he's more complicated than that . the picture that develops of his father is far from clear , making butch a less than reliable narrator . costner captures a surprising amount of nuance in his portrayal of butch , one minute the doting father , the next an edgy psychotic . it's a radical change of pace for costner , and he pulls it off . perhaps the larger credit for a perfect world's success is t . j . lowther . he's not asked to say much , but his expressive face becomes one of the most vital elements in the film . the relationship between butch and philip is the heart of a perfect world , and it's nearly perfectly executed . director eastwood's first outing since his oscar for unforgiven is a similarly dark piece about a struggle for redemption , and while the whole may not be as strong as last year's best picture winner , some of the moments are even better . the opening sequence is instantly gripping , and a long shot of butch and philip walking through a field , the boy repeatedly attempting to hold the criminal's hand , is wonderful . the best sequence comes near the end , as an idyllic waltz quickly turns into a remarkably intense confrontation . eastwood draws out the ending a bit too long , but by that point i was more than willing to stick with butch and philip . a perfect world is really two films . one is mediocre at best , but the other is one of the best films of the year . together , they still add up to one of the better films of the year . a note to inside joke watchers : look for a billboard for "" bull durham tobacco "" in the sequence at friendly's store .

1802,"screenplay : roddy doyle . director : stephen frears . television has given the term "" situation comedy "" a bad name , but that might be the most appropriate epithet for the snapper . there's no high concept , no men in drag or mistaken identities . the snapper is just remarkably adept at making the mundane comic , at making us laugh at real life . thanks largely to colm meaney's charming lead performance , it's just one of the most purely enjoyable comedies of 1993 . with such a simple premise , execution becomes paramount , and the snapper is very well-executed . director stephen frears ( dangerous liaisons , hero ) keeps the comedy human by concentrating on faces and reactions , a technique used most effectively during pub scenes where extreme close-ups of drunken individuals emphasizes distorted perceptions . these are loud and boisterous characters ( a bit excessively so in the case of sharon's cackling clique ) , and frears allows this liveliness to permeate the film . without resorting to location cityscapes , frears creates a rich atmosphere peopled with sparkling characters . the standout among those characters is colm meaney's dessie . dessie is a unique creation , a loving father and husband who avoids the slew of cliches typical of irish characters and father characters in general . meaney is perfect , playing a more nuanced version of the same character he played in the commitments . his moments with sharon are wonderfully warm , even through his frustration at the embarrassment her condition has caused him ; particularly good is a brief , low-key scene as dessie shares with sharon his amazement at the contents of a book on sexuality . it's a performance unlikely to garner much attention for award nominations , but its as deserving of honors as any work out there . the rest of the cast is a bit more uneven . even more so is fionnuala murphy as sharon's best friend jackie . pat laffan's george burgess is a small role , but he does quite a lot with it , making george a rather pathetic figure . generally , the snapper is better when it's not in the pub , and the volume knob on the characters is turned down . some viewers may be made uncomfortable by the circumstances surrounding sharon's sexual encounter , but i found the story depended on those circumstances , and that sharon's response to her situation defined her character . the snapper doesn't moralize , it just sets up a scenario and lets characters react . i found those reactions extremely funny , although i needed to break out my irish- to-american profanity dictionary on more than one occasion . you'll need to play close attention to pick up all the dialogue in the snapper , but it will be well worth the effort .

1803,"starring : juliette binoche , benoit regent , charlotte very . screenplay : krzysztof kieslowski & krzysztof piesiewicz . i can't claim that my experience with french films has been all that extensive , but the limited experience i have had has lent itself to the following stereotypical image : two characters sitting in a dimly lit cafe , smoking cigarettes and speaking cryptically to one another in extremely muted tones . these films tended to deal with emotionally stunted people in an emotionally stunted manner , potentially intriguing but inert , if not downright soporific . it caused me no end of amusement to find a scene exactly like the one i just described in krzysztof kieslowski's three colors : blue . it caused me more pleasure to discover that scene only one part of a complex and fascinating character study of grief , directed with a mesmerizing grace . so now i wonder . . . is it french cinema that has changed , or is it me ? from a narrative standpoint , blue is not the most easily accessible of films . there is very little dialogure , in fact very little sound of any kind ; even the car crash is notable for its understatement . only the occasional explosions of zbigniew preisner's score tend to break the silence , loading the music with significance . kieslowski chooses to allow us into julie's world almost entirely through images , but how arresting those images are . it's a confident but rarely showy directing job by kieslowski , allowing julie's story to unfold slowly and clearly . the centerpiece of blue is the performance of juliette binoche as julie , and it's a winner . while not the type of performance american film audiences are used to seeing , it is nonetheless extremely effective . at times the role might appear one-note , yet there are deeper shadings . binoche proves herself as deserving as any actor this year of oscar consideration . where blue is likely to irritate many is in the deliberate opaquity of some of its images . blue proves to be very slow going at times , and requires immense patience . however , as details concerning the relationship between julie and patrice unfold , such patience will be proved worthwhile . three colors : blue is an intensely focused examination of one woman's attempt at self-deception for her own perceived good , and will likely stick with me for some time .

1804,"screenplay/director : mike leigh . i can thoroughly understand someone either loving or loathing mike leigh's naked . on the one hand , it is a rather unpleasant visceral experience with troubling images of violence against women ; on the other hand , it is unflinching in its acidic humor and features a tour-de-force performance by david thewlis . yet for my money , there is another level at which naked approaches brilliance . this film is a warning designed for the self rather than for society , a startling examination of one mind's response to dehumanization . with johnny , mike leigh has created a magnificent character who serves as a prophet of the apocalypse , an apocalypse he describes in terms rather different from what one might expect . and on and on , too many instances to mention , all connected to johnny's larger obsession with evolution . the title of the film itself becomes an acknowledgement of our status in the universe : when all the frills are stripped away , we're just big monkeys , monkeys who seem to have stopped reaching for more . all the brilliance in the world in the writing would have counted for little withough a perfect actor for johnny , and david thewlis is that actor . his sarcastic , often bilious musings easily could have come off as smug and self-congratulatory , but thewlis pours a great deal of emotion into his lines . yes , he believes that he is more aware than those around him , but he derives no pleasure from that knowledge , instead finding only disgust with it . thewlis is supported by several other fine performances , most notable claire skinner's small but memorable role as the frantic sondra ; only cruttwell rings false with his slimy sebastian . naked is not without its faults . an encounter between johnny and a young scots couple who can't seem to find one another is funny , but doesn't really connect to the rest of the film . the sebastian character is way too much , too crudely drawn to work as the representation of gilded brutishness he is meant to be . naked has a semblance of a narrative through-line , but basically it's a collection of snapshots viewed through johnny's singular lens , and that collection can appear somewhat unfocused . but from its first jarring frames to its final shot of johnny limping down a london street , it risks showing us the side of ourselves we don't like to see , and hoping we won't turn away .

1805,"director : mary harron . mpaa rating : r ( violence , sexual situations , nudity , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 97 minutes . i've never read the bret easton ellis novel on which american psycho is based , so i don't know whether its reputation as literary garbage is warranted . that could easily make for a very tedious , dehumanizing read , so i can understand why potential viewers might be skeptical about a film version of this much-reviled book . after all , what could possibly be entertaining about watching a sociopath spend an hour and a half obsessing over colognes and suits between capital crimes ? harron's telling of the tale mixes 1980s nostalgia with pitch-black humor , anchored by christian bale's riveting performance . the heartless , soulless heart and soul of american psycho is bale's brilliant performance as bateman . bad for leo ; good for us . bale plays bateman with an exaggeration that's sure to be misconstrued as hamming it up . bale's work is also brutally funny , most notably in scenes where he engages in rambling deconstructions of some of the decade's most banal music ( huey lewis' "" hip to be square ; "" genesis' "" in too deep "" ) . if this performance doesn't prove to be one of the year's best , we're in for a very good year indeed . there is , of course , also the matter of the much-talked-about sex and violence , which cost the version screened at the sundance film festival a few seconds of excised gyrating . naturally the content will make american psycho a film for very specific tastes , but viewers should be clear that this isn't primarily a thriller we're talking about . yes , there are suspense elements , and there are a few grisly deaths ( most taking place out of the frame ) , and there are some moments of moderately explicit naughtiness . all of those elements should also be viewed in context . how anyone could view bateman's narcissistic orgy as pornographic ( or even eroitic ) is beyond me ; how the film could be perceived as a commercial for unbridled appetites and surrender to the id is baffling . there's no point pretending american psycho has anything radically new , profound or insightful to say about its era . satirical critiques of yuppie materialism have already become somewhat trite a decade later , and it's clear from minute one that the film is about turning the figurative ability to get away with murder into the literal equivalent . that doesn't make many of american psycho's finer moments any less effective , from the shallow one-liners ( "" i'm not really hungry , but i want to have a reservation somewhere "" ) to the hysterical scene in which characters define their pecking order by the quality of their business cards . the third act does begin to drag , and the hallucinatory closing scenes are bound to leave some viewers scratching their heads . but american psycho gets creepier , funnier and more insinuating the longer i think about it . source material be damned : even if ellis' american psycho is junk , it provided the framework for something savagely entertaining . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1806,"i'm no marketing whiz , but it would appear that someone made a serious error in the advertising campaign for the new australian import sirens . one might be inclined to believe that the target audience is men , and that sirens is simply some soft-core porn throwaway . in fact , sirens has more in common with enchanted april than it does with emmanuelle . writer/director john duigan , creator of the wonderful coming-of-age films the year my voice broke and flirting , has fashioned another tale of sexual awakening , this time focusing on an adult , and it's a delightfully acted and beautifully filmed comedy-drama . sirens skillfully interweaves two themes without seeming overstuffed . that world is populated by wombats , insects and even flowers which take on a kind of personality . the characters native to this world are frequently shown eating apples , practically wallowing in their connection to original sin . lindsay challenges the christian notion of sin as linked to female sexuality , and sirens is largely the playing out of that challenge . at the same time , the issue of artistic censorship is very much part of the subtext . he presents the church's case with a respect for its views , and hugh grant is a charming and surprisingly hip spokesman . while the arguments are nothing special , and in fact tend towards the cliche , duigan treats the issue of art , its influence on the public and the artist's responsibility as a legitimate subject of debate . if there is any fault to be found with duigan's script , it's that he does skimp on his characters in the interest of establishing his analogy . the relationship between anthony and estella is not as well-established as it might be , and lindsay himself is little more than a catalyst for estella's transformation . macpherson and fischer look good , but they're given too much to say and it's never all that interesting when they do speak . however , sirens does quite a lot with its visuals , highlighting its glorious australian settings , and it maintains a frisky sense of humor about its sensual subject matter without sniggering over it . those who might be looking for a leering sex romp should look elsewhere ; sirens is lyrical , lively and thoughtful and always a feast for the senses .

1807,"mpaa rating : r ( profanity , nudity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 108 minutes . there were cries of outrage from adults who just didn't understand the rebellious messages of this new musical form , accompanied by the certain knowledge that civilization as we knew it was about to come to an end . and finally , there was the inevitable transformation of rebellion and singularity into its own kind of conformity . anyone at all familiar with the pistols would hope to high heaven that a film-maker wouldn't choose to tell their story in the measured tones of hero worship . julien temple has already documented the sex pistols in 1980's the great rock 'n' roll swindle , so there was the danger that the filth and the fury would feel not just like a canonization of a pioneering band , but a recycled canonization . instead , temple captures not just the energy of the pistols , but their satirical sense of playfulness as well . with music , animation and dozens of archival clips , temple compiles a film that doesn't merely lay out a sex pistols chronology ; it captures the atmosphere and the attitude of anarchy in the u . k . that's not to say that it's instantly reliable as the definitive sex pistols story . swindle may have been an obvious attempt at self-congratulation by mclaren , but the filth and the fury occasionally seems just as much like an ego piece for johnny rotten . rotten may very well be a more reliable historian of the pistols than mclaren , but when he and jones relate differing accounts of a hotel room snafu , it's hard not to here rotten's version as a bit of overdramatization . make no mistake , it's still tremendously interesting listening to rotten's perspective on the rise and fall of the band . that's actually a fairly minor quibble with a film as vital and generally unpretentious as the filth and the fury ( you don't get less pretentious than steve jones' crudely honest reason for wanting to be in a band ) . of course , he probably would be less concerned with the philosophizing than pure sensory jolt , and that's something the filth and the fury provides . it took the sex pistols two years to distill rock and roll into every one of its basic elements . it takes julien temple 108 minutes to do the same thing to the sex pistols . it's a story with the frantic , two-and-a-half-minute raw energy blast of a classic punk anthem . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1808,"screenplay : rafael azcona , from a story by azcona , jose luis garcia sanchez & fernando trueba . director : fernando trueba . it was considered something of an upset when the academy award for foreign language film went to spain's belle epoque , but in retrospect it really shouldn't have been . belle epoque bears more than a passing resemblance to that former winner ; it's a sunny , sensual comedy with all the makings of a crossover success . although it features no real story to speak of , and some clownish characters , its frisky tone and clever direction by fernando trueba make it a worthwhile experience . comedy is probably the hardest cinematic genre to translate from foreign language films , so it is high praise indeed to note that belle epoque had the audience where i saw the film laughing hard and often . the subtitling is superb , losing only minor idioms in the translation . those more familiar with spanish history and culture might be quicker to figure out what a "" carlist "" is , or the humor behind the parish priest's affinity for philosopher miguel de unamuno , but far more of the fun in belle epoque transcends particulars of culture . there are delightful moments of physical comedy , most notably violeta's gender-bending seduction of fernando while both are in costume at a carnival . the humor is almost entirely accessible , and it's very winning . much of belle epoque's earthy charm comes from the slightly anachronistic "" if-it-feels-good-do-it "" attitude of many of the principal characters . however , belle epoque makes no pretense to being "" about "" anything , and it is in that respect that the film commits its few errors . there is really no plot , just a series of amusing encounters which don't serve to develop any of the characters . the characterizations are somewhat weak , particularly that of fernando , whose seminarian background , professed agnosticism and unabashed romanticism are never successfully linked . clara , luz and rocio are too sketchy , and juanito is simply a buffoon . there are two strong performances , from ariadna gil as violeta and fernando fernan gomez as manolo , and it is no coincidence that they are also the most fully developed characters . still , belle epoque does what trueba intends for it to do , which is to entertain and amuse . it may not have been my choice for an oscar , but there could have been far worse choices .

1809,"it's a terrible habit of mine that i often find myself watching non-english language films throught he lens of "" how would hollywood screw this up . "" aside from the implied inherent superiority of all things sub-titled , there's the strange problem of comparing a film i'm watching to a film that hasn't even been made , but which in my head is a dire experience indeed . a film can't help but seem glorious under such conditions , though it doesn't help the discussion of the film on its own merits . i was doing a pretty good job of avoiding the hypothetical comparison in zhang yimou's not one less , until a curious thing happened : in its final fifteen minutes , it started to turn into its own hollywood incarnation . thank heaven it's so good for so long that the strange twist can't spoil the experience . the impressive thing about both zhang's direction and shi xiangsheng's script ( based on his account of his experience as a rural teacher ) is how gradually and unobtrusively wei's character develops . she's pretty unsympathetic at the outset -- utterly unqualified for her post , effective primarily at playing goalkeeper at the schoolroom door , but not at all troubled about demanding her money . the cleverly handled scenes of wei leading the class in math problems with very real-world implications make for a solid foundation , but it's only when wei heads into the city that her quest becomes more selfless . wei's quest and the growing she does along the way make for a thoroughly compelling narrative , but zhang has socio-political fish to fry as well . it's still a satisfying resolution , but it's excessively underlined . it's the way hollywood films too often try to convince an audience they've not just watched an enjoyable film , but also become more compassionate , better-informed citizens of the world . the frustrating part is that it's so unnecessary . virtually from the outset , the financial conditions of the school become an effective part of the drama ; you'd never expect a film to wring such tension from a student stepping on the school's more-precious-than-gold chalk supply . the rookie actors are raw , but do a more than serviceable job of performing their own lives . in short , not one less does everything a film needs to do to draw you into its world , and into the characters inhabiting that world . when it resorts to a message-heavy happy ending , it suddenly feels like another sort of film entirely . for a thankfully brief moment , i saw a glimpse of the mass-market crowd-pleaser that might have been . it's a reminder of how much more pleasing a film can be when it sticks to simpler truths . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1810,"let's compare the cinematic bards of baltimore for a moment . if i'm guessing , i'd say that the chamber of commerce might lean towards levinson . however , when putting their latest films head to head , i think my choice is obvious . a lot of people . waters manages to comment on so many different aspects of contemporary society that it's hard to believe he intended them all . without hand-wringing , waters points out our complicity in such crimes through our fascination with them . his one stumble into heavy-handedness comes when chip's girlfriend reacts to the difference between real blood and movie blood , but basically waters keeps the tone light with his cartoonish style . social commentary aside , serial mom is just plain funny . the opening is a bit slow , but serial mom finishes with high energy . turner has suffered through so many bad films in recent years that it is a pleasure to see her with something she can sink her teeth into . her smiling amalgam of donna reed and hannibal lecter is frequently campy , but always appealing , creating another level of identification which implicates the audience . it's true that the characters in serial mom are one-dimensional , but that's almost appropriate given the film's framework as a "" true-crime "" re-enactment of the real events . serial mom is fun with an edge , and it killed me .

1811,"director : robinson devor . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 90 minutes . pulp-noir is tough to pull off in this era of self-referential hipness . strangely enough , pulp-noir satire may be even tougher to pull off , since the entire genre itself fairly reeks of self-parody every time a hard-boiled guy , a hard-boiled situation and hard-boiled voice-over dialogue combine on screen . now take that pulp-noir satire and base it on a real pulp novel , and you've got the potential for a smug disaster . it _couldn't_ work . writer/director robinson devor had the recipe for yet another inert genre parody in his hands , but somehow he turned it into something so wonderfully warped it's almost impossible to resist . but he could be in for hard lessons about "" the biz . "" if the above summary sets you to puzzling over the film's title , fear not . in the 1950s and 1960s , willeford wrote within a genre where publishers couldn't care less what was inside the cover , so long as a broad in a tight sweater and a provocative title were on the cover . robinson devor uses willeford's own off-beat sensibility as a launching pad , then turns the woman chaser into such a twisted combination of subversion and homage that you can only ride along where it takes you . devor nails the genre atmosphere , helped greatly by kramer morgenthau's marvelous black-and-white a la kiss me deadly cinematography and warburton's note-perfect narration . parody only seems to work when it's inspired by genuine affection , and devor clearly loves film noir , mannered conventions and all . he also figures out that his story is a way to give a fresh twist to the trite independent film premise of making an independent film . from richard's intense pitch of his film's concept , to his unconventional methods of eliciting performances , to his obsession with the perfect edited length of his film , the woman chaser finds a kick for every predictable situation . taking the concept out of the present day film-making world gives it the perfect touch of the surreal , without even the faintest hint of the superior outsider attitude that too often hinders movies about making movies . there are ebbs in devor's pacing , and a narrative that doesn't always hang together except as a showcase for warburton's tremendously entertaining performance . yet even then there's entertainment value in virtually every aborted narrative thread . it's too easy to praise a film simply for being different , but the woman chaser is different in all the right ways . it's energetic and imaginative where other parodies are too often limp and witless . it skewers the ego of film-makers , but never loses its love for film-making . it even pokes fun at film noir without resorting to predictable gags . the woman chaser is a surprise in every positive sense of the word , because really , it shouldn't work . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1812,"screenplay : david hayter . producers : lauren shuler donner and ralph winter . director : bryan singer . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 100 minutes . i think it's fair to say that i've been looking forward to a film version of x-men for a while now -- somewhere in the neighborhood of 23 years , as a matter of fact . x-men #107 was one of the first comic books i ever bought , and it launched me on a love affair with the medium that abated only when , as a college student , i could no longer afford my habit . some readers may suspect that this history would lead me to go easy on an adolescent fan-boy . personally , i thought it would make me much tougher . after all , a 23-year wait can do something to one's expectations . i didn't think i'd settle for anything less than the kind of comic book adaptation you almost never see : one that combines rousing heroic action with a solid story . to my joy and astonishment , that's exactly what i got . x-men is not just a great comic book movie ; it's actually a pretty good movie _period_ . for those unfamiliar with the source material , the x-men are mutants -- humans with unusual powers that manifest themselves during puberty . that choice not only gives the story an emotional anchor , it gives plenty of screen time to x-men's most intriguing character and easily its best performance . you've probably never seen australian actor hugh jackman before -- though he resembles a brawnier gary sinise -- but you will see him again , because the guy has charisma to burn . jackman offers everything a fan could hope for in a portrayal of wolverine , from the trademark muttonchops to the genuine sense of mystery and menace . if x-men had nothing else going for it but jackman , it would still be worth seeing . the wonderful thing is that x-men _does_ have more going for it . it offers dozens of insider gags for the x-men faithful , while avoiding the slavish devotion to every detail that can interfere in solid film story-telling . and , just in case it matters to anyone , it offers some of the kick-ass-in'-est action scenes this side of the matrix . the fact that you don't have to wade through 90 minutes of junk to get to it is a wonderful bonus . of course x-men has its flaws . there's not much for halle berry to do but look intense when her eyes go white , which is probably all for the best given the incredible disappearing accent she occasionally employs . the script also doesn't do quite enough with turning magneto into a genuinely tragic villain , especially given the amount of time devoted to his back-story in the prologue . it's always tough for a film like x-men to lay the foundation while still delivering the goods , so it's inevitable that there are going to be some lulls and loose ends . i was startled , however , by how few there were . maybe my inner adolescent fan-boy did emerge during x-men , but it emerged because the film reminded me of the best the comic book had to offer , as well as some of the best an action film can offer . i think it was worth the wait , though i have a sneaking suspicion it won't be 23 years before the x-men hit the screen again . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1813,"screenplay : robert king . director : mick jackson . when i stepped into the theater to see clean slate , i had yet to see any evidence that dana carvey might actually be capable of acting . in fact , he seemed incapable of anything but the broadest schtick . his "" saturday night live "" characters were usually caricatures , and the wayne's world films and the horrible opportunity knocks simply regurgitated those characters . so it qualifies as one of the most unexpected surprises of the year that clean slate turns out to be an absolutely delightful comedy . as improbable as the concept might seem , director mick jackson ( the bodyguard ) reins in carvey's tendency towards excess and gives him a real character to work with , and the chance to generate big laughs . clean slate is so full of unpredictable pleasures that it's difficult to know where to begin . the greatest is probably the performance of carvey , in a role analagous in many ways to bill murray's in groundhog day . the nature of pogue's condition inevitably limits his character development , but merely watching carvey react to that situation is endlessly entertaining . but there is virtually nothing about clean slate which isn't quirky , off-handed and charming . director jackson complements the weirdness with visual throwaways like the neck brace james earl jones' character wears with a hole for his tie to come through , and the band-aid carvey sports through out the film . clean slate is that rare comedy which simply never goes exactly where you expect it to go . all this would be quite enough to recommend clean slate , but it also provides a neatly-polotted little mystery . occasionally it feels as though king and jackson are trying to throw in a bit too much ( the character of pogue's ex-wife is particularly unnecessary ) , which sidetracks the film's energy . however , at the end of clean slate i was left without a single plausibility problem . in the 24 hours since i saw clean slate , bits and pieces have popped into my head constantly , prompting spontaneous laughter , and it just keeps growing on me . it wouldn't be surprising , given carvey's track record and an advertising campaign which can't do it justice , to see clean slate make a quick exit from theaters . then again , there might just be one more surprise coming .

1814,"screenplay : elizabeth cuthrell , david urrutia and oren moverman , based on the book by denis johnson . director : alison maclean . jesus' son is a film about addiction -- only it's not , really . the way we're used to seeing films about addiction , there's a message , a lesson , an agenda . drugs are bad , the effects of drugs on users and their immediate circle of acquaintances are worse , and our hero would be a perfectly happy and productive member of society if not for that thing he wouldn't just say no to . these tend to be films in which the ostensible messed-up protagonist isn't really the center of the film . it's the needle that's the center of the film , or the bottle , or the rolled-up $100 bill . addiction isn't just the theme ; it's the star . so let's re-phrase that introduction : jesus' son is a film about fh ( billy crudup ) -- short for f * * * head -- a man who eventually becomes an addict . fh narrates his story with all the straight-ahead narrative lucidity you'd expect of a perpetually stoned guy ; he riccochets back and forth in time , picking up one thread of the story in the middle of another story when he recalls something he's forgotten to tell us . director alison maclean and her trio of writers give jesus' son a playfulness that's entertaining even as it never shies away from the darkest sides of addiction . it's a film with the wonderfully scrambled logic of drug use itself . but in case you missed the caveat , this is not exactly a film about addiction . crudup finds a cohesiveness to fh's character through the episodic film , and even manages to keep up with jack black's scene-stealing orderly in the film's most hilarious segments . jesus' son works not because the individual scenes are so effective ( though they are ) or because the portrayal of addiction is so grimly affecting ( because it is not ) , but because fh is a great anchor for a film that heads in so many different directions . perhaps inevitably , jesus' son eventually turns to the subject of fh's attempts to get straight , and it's a bit depressing that the film loses so much steam once drugs are no longer involved . perhaps the come-down is relative after such a wonderful first hour ; perhaps there's nothing for an episodic film to do but find a somewhat arbitrary place to stop . even the sluggish conclusion can't diminish the surprising , darkly comic experience of jesus' son , however . how refreshing to see addiction take a back seat to the addict , to see the needle in its appropriate place as supporting player . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1815,"screenplay : hugh leonard . director : john irvin . i can't think of a film in the last few years set in ireland that i did not enjoy , and i'm fairly sure it's not coincidence . it's me celtic roots crying out , it is . the verdant hills , the piqued accents , the mystical catholicism . . . all grip me in a way that is difficult to explain . so i warn ye to take my comments regarding widows' peak with a certain grain of salt , even though i believe that you don't need to be a celtophile to find it a wonderfully entertaining comedy-mystery . widows' peak was directed by john irvin , whose previous projects have been primarily action-oriented ( raw deal , hamburger hill ) , and it may be that sensibility which makes this film more than just another pastoral romp . while there is plenty of lovely scenery , there is also a tremendous level of energy , a sassy edge uncommon to films in similar settings . the high spirits are further enhanced by the performances . joan plowright is wonderful as the dowager queen of widows' peak , even if she could play a part like this in her sleep by now . her matter-of- fact confidence that her every whim should be gospel is delightful to watch , as are the subtle ways in which she demonstrates her condescension . in her first post-woody outing , farrow reminds us that she can indeed play something besides a female version of woody allen's neurotic persona . her role here is a tricky one to pull off , balancing several layers of suspicion and deception , but she does pull it off , and with surprising grace . she gets some positively venomous lines , and seems to delight in delivering them . irvin has clearly made her role the showcase , and in one last lingering shot , seems to be saying , "" i knew you could do it . "" the mystery elements which drive the second half of the film are perhaps a bit too easy to figure out , as irvin and screenwriter hugh leonard underline each of their clues with too much emphasis . but if they are not tremendously surprising , it doesn't seem as though they were really intended to be . this is not a film predicated on some gasp-inducing , crying game-like twist ; rather , the plot twists are just there to allow the character development , befuddling at first , to fall into place . in fact , the only time widows' peak really slows down is when there is lengthy exposition , particularly at a dinner party which is unfortunately handled in a slightly clumsy manner . but with or without the mystery , widows' peak would still have been funny and frisky , filled with nicely detailed cultural moments but mostly just a crisp and fun-filled hour and forty minutes .

1816,"as is probably the case for many of my worldly generation , my defining image of tammy faye bakker isn't even really of tammy faye bakker . it's the image of "" saturday night live's "" jan hooks doing tammy faye , all squeaky rebuking of demons and freely flowing mascara . tammy faye herself was a caricature , easy to mock because of that heart-on-the-sleeve demeanor and that garishly made-up face on that tiny body . and she was so easy to laugh at . randy barbato and fenton bailey's documentary the eyes of tammy faye is clearly an attempt to rehabilitate tammy faye now-messner's image , made with the full cooperation of the first lady of televangelism . and it's a frequently fascinating character study that puts a truly human face on the much-maligned woman . the eyes of tammy faye is full of the sort of eye-opening tidbits that make a documentary more than a parade of facts , places and dates . there's humor in the clips of a pre-oscar kevin spacey playing jim bakker in a made-for-tv movie , and drama in the machinations of jerry fallwell to force the bakkers out of ptl ( fallwell himself refused to be interviewed for the film ) . all documentaries should be this entertaining . it's also not clear until the film is nearly over that it has spent most of its running time avoiding its most intriguing subject : the present-day tammy faye . the goofy genuineness that emerges in scenes like her reaction to being in a grounded airplane during an electrical storm make for a much more human story than the story of the bakkers' pre-scandal careers . none of that makes the eyes of tammy faye any less worth watching ; in fact , it's almost like two provocative short films effectively fused together . it's also playful ( the babe-esque chorus of sock puppets reading the chapter titles ) , informative and even a little bit inspirational . it's a treat getting to know that plucky survivor , and learning that there's something more than someone else's caricature behind that trademark mascara . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1817,"screenplay : raymond defelitta . director : raymond defelitta . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 104 minutes . sentimentalized stories of the 1950s have become so commonplace in film that it's incredibly refreshing to find one that doesn't whitewash the darker side of the happy days . raymond defelitta's two family house is in some ways a familiar feel-good story , but it gives its good feeling an unexpected edge . for a while , two family house looks like it might turn into a broad comedy , with the italians and irish clashing loudly and perhaps farcically . in fact , she's scoffing at even more than that , as are buddy's friends in a slightly different way . what is ridiculous to them is the idea of anyone moving too far beyond the proscribed ethnic , cultural and even geographic boundaries . buddy's willingness to extend a hand to mary , just like his desire to pursue a career dream , suggests that the boundaries are a bit blurry . and the idea of blurry boundaries makes everyone around buddy more than slightly uncomfortable . even without its subtext , two family house is a funny , well-acted and tremendously appealing drama -- so appealing that it might even be perceived as fantastically generous to its protagonist . rispoli delivers a nicely nuanced performance as buddy , a teddy bear of a guy trying to move forward rather than look back in bitterness at missed opportunities or failures . it occupies that treacherous middle ground between comedy and drama where a film can either feel too frivolous or not frivolous enough . fortunately , defelitta understands how to make his film about more than its obvious premise without resorting to overly-weighty symbolism . culture clashes tend to be represented on screen either in strident sociology lectures or fish-out-of-water yuk-fests . it's an achievement that's not nearly as simple as it looks . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1818,"starring : rusty cundieff , larry b . scott , mark christopher lawrence , kasi lemmons . screenplay/director : rusty cundieff . film reviewers , myself included , often obsess over originality . everything is derivative , we lament ; everything is recycled . then , periodically , i am reminded that given the choice between an original film and a good one , i would much prefer the latter . fear of a black hat has been referred to as this is spinal rap on more than one occasion , and it is true that there is more than a passing similarity between the two . all right , there is a remarkable similarity . but ultimately , only one thing really matters : fear of a black hat is very , * very * funny , probably the funniest film of the year so far . ( niggaz with hats ) , whose members are rappers ice cold ( rusty cundieff ) and tasty taste ( larry b . scott ) and dj tone def ( mark christopher lawrence ) . in terms of plot structure , it often seems that writer/ director/star rusty cundieff decided simply to "" colorize "" spinal tap . it is not simply the framing device which is borrowed , but a multitude of specific details : gigs with somewhat insulting billing on the marquis ; internal squabbles triggered by a domineering girlfriend ; tap's series of ill-fated drummers replaced by n . w . h . 's series of ill-fated managers . yet with all these borrowed elements , there are a couple of other things cundieff might have been well-served to duplicate . one is keeping the framing structure consistent . frequently the camera work breaks out of the verite style for shots a single-camera documentary really couldn't be filming . the other is keeping the performances as deadpan as possible . if fear of a black hat tends to stumble , it's when it veers into campiness . even then , there are some huge laughs to be had in black hat . tone def's solo project is a hilarious bit modeled after p . m . but cundieff is perhaps most adept at skewering rap's self-important politics through ice cold's wonderfully improbable explanations of how songs such as "" booty juice "" actually contain an important social message . even the misogyny in rap culture is nailed perfectly in a single line , perhaps the film's funniest ( be sure to stay through the credits or you'll miss it ) . there are a lot of great details in fear of a black hat ( my favorite being tasty taste's massive bowling-trophy-on-a-chain necklace ) , which makes it frustrating that cundieff often plays up the broader bits . an obligatory scene in which ice cold is pulled over and hassled by a rent-a-cop is dragged out far too long , and a parody of new jack city seems only to serve as a way to take a jab at black filmmakers ( "" jike spingleton "" is the director ) . still , i laughed harder and more often at fear of a black hat than at any other movie in quite some time . make sure you're in the house when n . w . h .

1819,"starring : jasper salen , stellan skarsgaard , basia frydman , niclas olund . it may be my imagination , but the last two years seem to have been a particularly good time to be a young actor . whether it's representative of some societal yearning for a return to innocence , a rare influx of young talent , or some happy confluence of the two , coming-of-age dramas have become nearly as ubiquitous as hugh grant . none of which makes a good one any less desirable , and the slingshot is a good one indeed , a sharply written swedish import with a singular perspective and exceptional performances . but in spite of his many obstacles , roland navigates through his difficult world with determination and an inventive spirit . as with the other recent films i mentioned , the slingshot rests squarely on the small shoulders of its young star , and jasper salen is up to the task . with a round , open face reminiscent of a christmas story's peter billingsley , salen manages to convey both innocence and toughness in the delicate balancing act required by ake sandgren's adaptation . while many things happen * to * roland , he is never merely a receptacle . roland is always thinking , and it is this intelligence that comes through in salen's performance . although the slingshot is , as one might expect , primarily episodic , it is still rich enough thematically that it never feels like merely a loose collection of scenes . foremost among these themes is the clash of capitalism and socialism , personified by roland himself . when roland shows a cat his newly refurbished bike and says to it , "" that's mine , "" it is as succinct a statement of rebellion as one might imagine . the slingshot's key failing may be that it tries to do too much , and some of the scenes begin to seem repetitive . the obligatory moment of sexual awakening seems just that--obligatory--and ends with a scene surprisingly lacking in emotional punch . those relationships , particularly roland's complex interaction with his father , are what make the slingshot memorable . thanks to jasper salen's splendid work , the slingshot takes its place as a worthy addition to the list of fine coming-of-age films .

1821,"producers : kevin costner , kevin o'donnell , peter o . almond and armyan bernstein . director : roger donaldson . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 138 minutes . not literal alarm bells for some civil defense drill -- metaphorical , artistic alarm bells for viewers with a sense of deja vu . this is a film about the cuban missile crisis , but here we are with a crew-cut costner in his domestic glory . will thirteen days , like jfk before it , make the mistake of looking at a pivotal moment in american history and asking , "" how did it affect kevin costner's fictional family ? "" then , for most of the film , something wonderful happens : we see no one but men in suits , trying to solve a seemingly unsolvable problem . as tautly directed by roger donaldson , thirteen days finds riveting drama in passionate debate , tricky politics and impossible decisions -- at least until the o'donnell kin start turning up again . do nothing , and doomsday is a five minutes flight from half of america . thirteen days is a history-based thriller that faces a variation on the knuckle-headed joke promulgated by the anti-titanic contingent : in this case , we know the boat ( or the human race ) _doesn't_ sink . but thirteen days isn't about whether or not the world will be bombed to cinders ; it's about the astonishing real-life war game played by capable but flawed people for the fate of civilization . for a film that is devoted largely to debate and description of scenarios , thirteen day is incredibly tense . we watch politicians go toe-to-toe with soldiers over the appropriate philosophical footing for dealing with the red menace . we watch brinksmanship played like two kids shoving each other on a schoolyard . it's the kind of smart film-making of ideas that can keep you on the edge of your seat waiting for a phone to ring , or not to ring . mostly , however , it's a profile in the courage under fire of john f . kennedy . plenty of films have opted either to canonize jfk as our great slain king or demonize him as a womanizing rich kid , but i don't think any film has ever made him as compelling a dramatic character . costner is a much-maligned dramatic actor , and he doesn't do himself favors here with a honking boston accent that's borderline absurd next to the subtler intonations of greenwood and culp ( as scary a dead ringer for rfk as you could imagine ) . policy can make surprisingly intense cinema , without a breakfast table or report card in sight . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1822,"screenplay : wang hui-ling , james schamus and tsai kuo-jung , based on the book by wang du-lu . director : ang lee . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , sexual situations ) running time : 120 minutes . before delving into the reasons crouching tiger , hidden dragon isn't the unqualified masterpiece it's been touted as , let's revel in the reasons it's still a cinematic joy in a year of mostly leaden entertainments . in one of the film's many inspiring action sequences , a pair of adversaries square off in battle , employing a mystical fighting technique that allows its adherents to virtually defy gravity . it is the moment when it's easiest to appreciate crouching tiger , hidden dragon as a giddy exercise in pure cinema showmanship . over and over again , it lifts you out of the mundane world of a theater seat . it also drops you back into that seat a bit roughly every once in a while , but why quibble ? as directed by ang lee , the story is both mythologically basic and epic in scope . as solid as the narrative is in many ways , it would be ridiculous to argue that its critical and commercial success will be rooted in the story . crouching tiger , hidden dragon is first and foremost an adventure , one that turns choreographed action into pure film art . the action sequences combine the astonishing talents of fight choreographer yuen wo-ping ( the matrix ) with spectacular wire work to create moments that make you want to stand up and applaud . there's never even a sense of redundancy as the film progresses ; each sequence serves its own purpose , and offers wonderful variations on the clashing of metal , feet and fists , and escapes up sheer walls . it's pure indiana jones fun with an unexpected sense of consequence . it's also a martial arts-heavy film in which the thematic elements actually matter . while crouching tiger is certainly enjoyable as a distaff spin on the usually testosterone-soaked chop-socky genre , it's more than a feminist action flick . for an action-filled film , there's a lot going on above the neck . that's quite a load for an adventure film to carry , and occasionally it's not quite up to the task . yet as ambitious as it is , crouching tiger , hidden dragon never feels self-important . as beautifully crafted as it is ( notably peter pau's cinematography and tan dun's score ) , it never turns into a stagnant parade of lovely images . and as fanciful as its action sequences are , they never inspire eye-rolling . crouching tiger , hidden dragon isn't a masterpiece , but it doesn't have to be . there's pleasure enough in a film that doesn't make you feel stupid while it sends you soaring over the treetops . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1824,"starring : harrison ford , willem dafoe , joaquim de almeida , henry czerny , donald moffatt , anne archer . screenplay : donald stewart , steven zaillian and john milius . director : phillip noyce . pyrotechnicians have had quite a showcase summer at the movies . it seems as though something has been blowing up around every corner--a freight jet in speed , the seven mile bridge in true lies , half of boston in blown away . there are also explosions in clear and present danger , the latest adaptation of tom clancy's best-selling novels , but don't let them fool you into thinking that's all there is to it . clear and present danger is the summer's sharpest thriller , less break-neck than speed but just as consistently tense , and is a quantum improvement over the disappointing patriot games . i wasn't terribly optimistic about clear and present danger after director phillip noyce's sluggish work on patriot games and the appalling sliver , but his work here positively crackles . the level of tension is nearly perfect in scenes that ordinarily would be hum-drum , like a walk through an airport where ryan is being shadowed by clark , but we're often unsure where clark is . there are a few moments where noyce goes overboard , like an inexplicable slow-motion shot of escobedo in a batting cage , and a sequence at a funeral that plays far too much like the baptism sequence from the godfather . these are minor quibbles , however , in a film that comes off as one of the best espionage thrillers in a decade . it might have been even better if harrison ford had managed to break out of his recent habit of playing every part in a slight daze . clear and present danger asks very little from its cast as a whole , though , so ford's lower-than-low-key ryan doesn't seriously detract from the proceedings . but let's be real here : no one expected james bond to be multi-faceted and tormented . clear and present danger is thoroughly plot-driven from minute one , and its oddball screenwriting team of john ( red dawn ) milius and steven ( schindler's list ) zaillian ( along with donald stewart ) do an impressive job with a challenging adaptation . if political moralizing isn't your cup of tea , be forewarned : clear and present danger has more than its share . it also has as much action as the bloated true lies , and nearly as many honest laughs .

1825,"starring : phoebe cates , jim broadbent , wendy hughes , stephen rea , kevin kline , john lithgow . screenplay : michael austin and john wells . director : michael austin . every once in a while , a film sneaks up on me and takes me completely by surprise . i don't necessarily mean in terms of quality ; rather , i'm referring to the mere knowledge of its existence . usually i know what films are on the way a year in advance , but two weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo . it has slipped rather quietly into limited release , and appears destined to slip out just as quietly . that's a shame , because princess caraboo is a delightful fable , romantic , gentle and very appealing . what's more , it's surprisingly insightful and provides a sharp-witted lesson in english social history . as a social satire and comedy of manners , princess caraboo is a winner . but it is handled most effectively through the character of mr . worrall , a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude . while hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule , director and co-writer michael austin keeps the treatment too light-hearted to be heavy-handed . it is then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in "" sensations , "" an idea that takes on a timeless quality ( and makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show ) . social commentary aside , princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment . the performers are mostly delightful , particularly phoebe cates , who is radiant in a part that requires a gift for pantomime . her supporting players are also appealing : wendy hughes as the patient and kindly mrs . worrall ; kevin kline as frixos , the worralls' suspicious and superior greek butler ; stephen rea as the world-weary but ultimately romantic gutch . only john lithgow is a disappointment , turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princess's identity . the story twists and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really a princess is always in some doubt , without becoming gimmicky . it is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo isn't given more time to develop , because the potential seemed to be there . when it finally does blossom , it seems too quick to be plausible . princess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time and place that it might seem a bit slow to viewers seeking a fantasy romp . still , it has both escapist and intellectual appeal , and is well worth seeking out . it is the kind of film that makes my job its most rewarding--a hidden gem .

1826,"screenplay : scott alexander and larry karaszewski . director : tim burton . it's hard to imagine a more unlikely subject for a film biography than edward d . wood jr . when i think of bio-pics , i think gandhi , my left foot , malcolm x--epic tales of great and inspirational figures . the director of plan 9 from outer space does not seem to be cut from quite the same cloth . the great surprise of ed wood is that in his own unique and twisted way , director tim burton has turned one of the worst filmmakers of all time into one of those inspirational figures . rather than holding wood up to ridicule , burton makes his life an example of artistic integrity , an extremely entertaining look at an auteur unlike any other . with lugosi and girlfriend dolores fuller ( sarah jessica parker ) , ed makes glen or glenda ? , a phenomenally incompetent melodrama . but ed is undaunted by the ridicule of others , and forges ahead to make more films , as well as forging a friendship with the ailing lugosi . burton based his vision for ed wood on one question : what if someone had all the drive of orson welles , but none of the talent ? that question , and its answer , are what make edward d . wood jr . 's story a comedy rather than a tragedy . after every clumsy take becomes not simply a paradigm for self-delusion , but a reminder that sometimes process is as important to art as product . the sincerity with which wood speaks to welles as an equal , and his determination to stay true to his vision , make him anything but pathetic . yet burton manages to tell another story in ed wood , that of the curious friendship between ed and bela lugosi . it is truly an example of mutual need--wood needs lugosi to lend his movies credibility ; lugosi needs wood to give him work , any work--but it's also something even more touching . it is respect which is the greatest gift ed gives him , and laundau's portrayal of his slow return to humanity is one of the finest pieces of acting this year . it is ed wood's niftiest accomplishment that it links these two stories so effortlessly . ed wood's uniquely wonderful naivete comes from the fact that he never fully grasps that hollywood was a business first . he is unable to understand how lugosi could be unable to find work , because to ed , his talent is all that should matter . ed wood is occasionally quite slow-moving , and loses much of its steam in its final twenty minutes . but the affection in burton's telling of this tale is infectious , and makes one wish more talented contemporary filmmakers were as relentlessly individual . "
1827,"screenplay : woody allen and douglas mcgrath . director : woody allen . last year's manhattan murder mystery was the kind of light comedy allen hadn't made in years , and seemed to indicate a desire to return to simpler times . bullets over broadway is another comedy , but it's no pure lark . hilarious as it is , it's also a sly bit of self-mockery , an indication that allen the artist acknowledges the foibles of allen the man . in fact , his direction seems a bit too constrained at times , as though the theater itself were creating a kind of claustrophobia . but while this is far from allen's best work as a director , his script , co-written by douglas mcgrath , is fantastic . the dialogue contains as many laugh-out-loud lines as any film this year , and the plot takes at least one twist so delightfully unexpected that its revelation may provide the single biggest laugh . in a year woefully short on good comedies , bullets over broadway may be a saving grace . as usual , allen has a marvelous ensemble cast at his disposal to bring his script to life , though not all are equally well-used . but the two showcase roles belong to dianne wiest and chazz palminteri . it's a wonderful , subtle performance worthy of oscar consideration . yet beneath all the laughs in bullets over broadway is a moral question framed by the reiner character's hypothetical question of which you would save from a burning building : the last copy of shakespeare's works , or some anonymous person . better to be a good man than a great artist , allen seems to argue , and it's difficult not to read that thesis as a minor mea culpa for his tabloid-headline exploits . in the course of exorcising some of his own demons , accompanied by a laugh track , allen has created one of his post purely entertaining films in years . "
1828,"screenplay : steve barancik . director : john dahl . the last seduction also made its first appearance on cable earlier this year , but from the looks of things , dahl will be able to make a few films directly for the big screen if he so chooses . film noir has been a hot genre lately , and few directors with more established reputations are making them better than john dahl . the last seduction is a wonderfully nasty piece of work , sparked by linda fiorentino's bad-to-the-bone lead performance . the critical error many recent film noir attempts have made ( the abysmal color of night comes most quickly to mind ) is that they operate on the premise that all you need are minimalist lighting and a few plot twists to maintain audience interest . characters become props holding up a plot , rather than the elements that drive the plot . dahl and screenwriter steve barancik do not make that error . in order for the last seduction to work to the fullest , berg has to convince us that there's a reason besides simple naivete that he stays with bridget , and he makes mike's need genuine . occasionally , that seems to be the case . because barancik deliberately avoids providing us with any easy motivation for bridget's actions ( a troubled childhood , for example ) , her calculation becomes a bit difficult to swallow in one gulp . but fiorentino is so alive in this part that she makes bridget real , and her glee is infectuous . the last seduction's plot does have the requisite twists , turns and surprises , but none of them are particularly jaw-dropping . dahl and barancik are more concerned with tone and character , and deliver in both categories . but if there is one aspect of the story which is truly impressive , it is what * doesn't * happen . the formulaic qualities of so many movies have conditioned us to expect a comeuppance for characters like bridget at a specific plot point ; however , at crucial moments when it seems that she's made a critical mistake , she's still one step ahead . clockwork plots like the last seduction can sometimes seem too contrived for their own good , and some viewere might find it simply too cold . many others will find fiorentino and the last seduction the perfect antidote to the recent glut of stylish but vacuous blockbusters . "
1829,"and that's the good news . this is the first directorial effort by peter mccarthy , producer of such films as repo man and tapeheads , and those credits should tell you all you need to know about the style and tone of floundering . it's a hilariously surreal examination of urban paranoia and hopelessness , filled with oddball characters , goofy stream-of-consciousness narrative and instantly quotable lines . floundering is told through a voiceover narration by john , but it's not so much about john as it is about the chaotic world around him . john is only the tour guide , but his observations are wonderfully off-the-wall : on the destruction in south central l . a . : "" maybe we should leave it as a reminder . . . then [peter] ueberroth will turn it into a riot theme park . "" if you ever walk into a room and find yourself instantly attracted to someone , get out of that room as fast as you can . "" mccarthy's script is rich with such moments . unfortunately , it's also rich with heavy-handed left-wing moralizing which could easily turn off those with differing points of view . it's therefore very fortunate that so many of the other minor roles are so funny . the snapshots taken by his mental camera provide a bitingly satirical collage of urban life , but surprisingly mccarthy doesn't opt for utter cynicism . instead , he manages to balance black-humored sarcasm and social commentary with an ultimately optimistic message of personal responsibility . for those who enjoy their comedy with an edge and don't mind the occasional preaching , there's a real winner to be found in floundering . besides , how can you not love a film that ends with two guitarists , one black and one white , singing a marvelously off-key duet of "" ( what's so funny 'bout ) peace , love and understanding ? "" "
1830,"maybe it's envy , maybe it's years of hollywood trying to sell every pretty boy or gorgeous girl as the next big thing , and maybe it's some combination of the two . for whatever reason , both moviegoers and critics alike seem to have incredible difficulty acknowledging that attractiveness and talent could go hand in hand . when he won as best actor in 1987 for the color of money , it was widely considered a lifetime achievement award , but apparently newman had at least one more trick up his sleeve : nobody's fool , a small , quiet drama driven by newman's delightfully weathered lead performance . but during this holiday season , there are other opportunities . writer/director robert benton has a gift for making low-key , relationship-based films ( kramer vs . kramer , places in the heart ) , and nobody's fool is a worthy heir to that tradition . benton uses his snow-covered locations beautifully , practically turning north bath into one of the characters in the story . in many ways , nobody's fool is as much about north bath as it is about sully . that connectedness makes the relationships between characters in nobody's fool a rare joy . sully's feud with carl is one of the few external conflicts in the film , manifested primarily in a game of stealing a snow-blower back and forth , but even that exchange is essentially good-humored . it's one of the things that makes sully so appealing as a character : as ornery as he can be , he always treats people decently . it's ironic--and perhaps part of the point of nobody's fool--that the one relationship which seems forced is that between sully and peter . still , there's something strangely satisfying about a meeting between an estranged father and son which doesn't include a shouting match or tears . he has reached a point in his career where he doesn't really play characters any more ; instead , he slips into them like the flannel shirts sully favors . that is in no way meant to belittle what newman does as an actor . the fact is that he makes it all look effortless , as though he's really been sully all his life , and someone just happened to turn the camera on at this moment . the background for the character ( an abusive father , his own abandonment of his family ) seems almost tacked on so the movie seems to be about something more , but newman doesn't really need it . it's newman's gift that he can do all that with a well-placed sigh and a twinkle in those eyes . "
1831,"arriving as it does in the middle of the newt gingrich-generated national discussion on the benefits of removing children from unstable homes , ladybird , ladybird could not be more timely . and while director ken loach could not possibly have realized it , he has made a film which should inspire both sides in this debate to consider their points of view more carefully . harrowing , challenging yet never pedantic , ladybird , ladybird is about as balanced a presentation of a difficult issue as one could hope for , a portrait of a self-destructive woman colliding with a by-the-book system , and brought to breathtaking life by a knockout debut performance from crissy rock . he tells maggie's story in a straight-ahead fashion , eschewing cinematic hyperbole or heavy musical cues . it is a dramatic enough story in its own right , and loach knows it . this is a story in which , ultimately , there are no winners , and loach refuses to let us off the hook by giving us a convenient villain . what really makes the ambiguity work is the incendiary performance by crissy rock , who had never acted before ladybird . hard-edged and painfully low on self-esteem , maggie repeatedly torpedoes her own chances for happiness by refusing to believe that she deserves any , and rock plays this out in several incredibly emotional scenes , every one of which feels completely honest . she layers maggie's character so expertly that at times it truly does appear that she is an unfit mother , making it hard to fault the government's intentions . it's powerful work by a performer who understands instinctively that a character like this has to be real , and rock truly becomes maggie . in fact , she's so powerful that she completely eclipses vladimir vega's jorge , whose character is never developed quite as fully as maggie's . there's a reason that he sticks by her through so much hardship , but i , like maggie , wasn't always sure what that reason was . the screenplay by rona munro , though based on a true story , is dramatically unwieldy towards the end ; scenes begin to repeat themselves , and i started to feel that i was being put through an emotional wringer . it's one of those cases where a bit of license with fact might have made for a tighter and even more effective story . but it amounts to quibbling to fault ladybird , ladybird for being too true to a gripping story . it's a film that makes demands of its audience , specifically to look at this story and to reach its own conclusions about whether or not maggie was treated fairly . her story is so riveting , and so spectacularly re-created by crissy rock , that any audience should be up to that challenge . "
1832,"screenplay : riwia brown . director : lee tamahori . critics are often heard complaining about the lack of originality in american filmmaking , about remakes , tv-retreads and tired concepts dominating the multiplexes . once were warriors is a wonderful example of what the movie-going experience can teach us given the opportunity . as an examination of the maori culture in contemporary new zealand , once were warriors showed me a world i had never seen before , and up until its overly melodramatic final half hour , it is a fascinating and unsettling drama . once were warriors has become a massive box office success in new zealand for addressing this culture which accounts for almost 10% of its population , but it doesn't require a stretch to recognize that it is a story which translates all too well to stories of america's economically disadvantaged minority cultures . it is a specific story , but in many ways it is also a universal one . the specific story is most effective thanks to several powerful performances . temuera morrison is even more complex as jake , because he makes a violent drunk appealing enough during his good moments to make the relationship convincing ; he is fred flintstone with a serious attitude . mamaengaroa kerr-bell , as the ever-more- pessimistic grace , is also good , as is taungaroa emile as the troubled boogie . while it is frighteningly real violence which drives once were warriors for much of its running time , pathos unfortunately takes over in the third act . there is a drawn-out sequence which gives everyone a chance to cry and make a speech , and characters start to speak in platitudes like , "" you're still a slave , jake . . . a slave to your fists "" and "" i'll wear my ( tatoos ) on the inside . "" by the end , i was wondering whether tamahori was taking his cue from hollywood , providing a feel-good resolution which tied up loose ends far too neatly , rather than sticking with the harsh realities of the world in which he has placed us . once were warriors is filled with memorable images , solid acting and a keen sense of place and character , but without even realizing it , tamahori has also told a story about urban sub-cultures far from his own home . "
1833,"screenplay/director : jeremy leven . once upon a time , marlon brando was considered by many to be the best american actor in film . brando has been on the big screen only a handful of times in the last twenty years , so the myth has transcended the actor . that is a shame , because not only can the man still act , he has shown a great sense of humor about himself . as writer , he has crafted a screenplay full of instantly quotable lines . but as clever a script as he has at his disposal , it is one of leven's choices as a director which makes it something special . while the narrated flashbacks of don juan's life are given a surreal tinge both by the nature of the subjects and don juan's florid description , the scenes involving interactions between other characters are almost hyper-real . the dialogue is simple , with lines frequently overlapping , and the camera is usually stationary . leven also coaxes two superb performances out of his lead actors . it is a light and very funny performance , matched and perhaps surpassed by johnny depp . he works so well , in fact , that several scenes between brando and dunaway probably ended up on the cutting room floor to allow depp's character more screen time . that's something of a shame , because the film is really about how mickler changes , and how those changes re-energize his marriage , and dunaway is too good to be so under-used . however , it is quibbling to fault don juan de marco for what isn't on the screen , when what is on the screen is so appealing . sweet , funny and unapologetically upbeat , don juan de marco is a perfect breezy spring entertainment . "
1834,"period adventures have been around as long as the movies . throughout that time , and especially into modern efforts , such films have rarely navigated successfully between the twin perils of the genre : tedious hero-worship on the one hand , grade-b schlock on the other . rare is the film that manages to be both exciting and intelligent , both compelling as character-based drama and a good old-fashioned good guys vs . bad guys tale . though the film's love story doesn't quite click , the main story is wonderfully acted and exhilarating to watch . the plot of rob roy is a fairly dense one , including a healthy dose of post-restoration english political machinations which might leave many viewers wondering why being accused of being a "" jacobite "" would be such a big deal . these instances are rare enough , however , not to be distracting . perhaps one reason is that in its structure and tone , rob roy has the archetypal appeal of a shakespeare play , with the political elements serving only to set up conflicts , not to define them . alan sharp's screenplay makes sure that even though the characters have mythic dimensions , they do not remain one-dimensional . that's the academic end . rob roy is also just a fine piece of movie-making , beginning with the superb direction of michael caton-jones . his opening shot is the perfect introduction to an epic , a breathtaking view of the highlands into which the characters slowly wander and draw closer . the pacing lags here and there , and the more brutal elements of the story are occasionally excessive , but those are exceptions in an otherwise top-notch job , particularly a pair of magnificently staged duels . special note should also go to carter burwell , who provides a stirring celtic-themed score . for my money though , rob roy works fundamentally because its villains--all three of them--are fantastic . as fine a job as liam neeson does with macgregor , his character is essentially a legend , a striking figure but fairly static . as for lange , she may be the weak link . her acting style has never been one of my favorites , and sometimes her emotions feel forced . rob roy tries to build the love story between rob and mary into one of the central elements , but the conflict between rob and the englishmen is always more interesting . nevertheless , all the elements combine into an extremely satisfying whole . rob roy is not for the squeamish , with its swordplay and a lengthy rape scene , nor is it for those looking strictly for a lusty romp . it is a story about characters as much as it is about battles , and it succeeds as both . "
1835,"they are the times that can make me begin to question what it is i am looking for in escapist entertainment , as i read raves for hyped-up disappointments like twister and mission : impossible and wonder what it is that i am supposed to be missing . they are the times when a piece of fluff like dragonheart seems that much better when compared to the competition , and they are the times when a film like the arrival , lacking a big star or never-before-seen special effects , will likely drown in a sea of higher-profile releases . but the arrival is the kind of thriller which reminds me _exactly_ what i'm looking for in escapist entertainment : a script which has genuine wit , genuine intelligence , and genuine excitement , and which convinces me that the writer spent at least as much time creating it as i spent watching it . that perfectly describes the arrival . the arrival marks the directing debut of writer david twohy ( the fugitive and the under-appreciated terminal velocity ) , and he demonstrates such a keen understanding of what makes an action thriller work that it seems he was born for the job . in the first minute of the film , he grabbed me by the collar with a beautifully constructed opening sequence , and for the next 109 minutes he simply refused to let go . there are sequences in the arrival which play like textbook examples of how to build tension , particularly one involving a room full of scorpions which is guaranteed to have you squirming if you have a pulse . there is a kind of suspense which plots based on paranoia are much better at generating , and twohy nails it , as well as turning it to humorous effect by connecting the greenhouse effect and the failure of the hubble telescope to alien visitors . that is really what separates the arrival from the pack : a sense of humor which surpasses most of the so-called comedies i see in any given year . sheen has a solid , deadpan sense of comic timing which worked well with twohy's terminal velocity script , and again he wraps each line in a wry self-awareness . zane is not a particularly dynamic role -- he's gung-ho about finding extra-terrestrial life , but it's never quite clear why -- and another actor might have given it more depth . however , sheen makes the comic lines feel un-scripted , and he appears to be adept at playing twohy's favored hero -- a resourceful individual whose actions under duress seem natural and basically intelligent . plus , there is a priceless irony to sheen , the most notorious and unapologetic customer of "" hollywood madam "" heidi fleiss , reading the line , "" there's something to be said for abstinence . "" the arrival is so effective in some of its early scenes that the big sequence in the aliens' lair comes as something of a disappointment , since twohy seems less concerned with maintaining the pace than he is with showing off his visual effects . there are a few logical errors i caught upon reflection , and the abrupt ending is likely to leave some viewers feeling a bit unsatisfied . but the arrival is a rarity so far this summer movie season : it is a smart and tightly-plotted film that i couldn't always out-guess , and didn't always find myself _trying_ to out-guess . i was so instantly aware of how skillfully david twohy could manipulate me that i simply let him . and that , friends , is how i define "" willing suspension of disbelief . "" i shot andy warhol is exceedingly well-documented , and that makes it great journalism . mary harron directs her actors and her environment to perfection , and that makes it great theater . what is missing is human drama , and a sense of what this story is really about . that , quite simply , does not make a great film . "
1836,"screenplay : julian schnabel . director : julian schnabel . yes , i understand : happy artists do not exactly make for compelling drama . still , you have to admit that the cult of the tortured artist seems to have more adherents in hollywood than scientology . toulouse-lautrec in moulin rouge . . . tortured . so why is it that basquiat feels so completely unique ? perhaps it is because , for a change , its principal character is portrayed as a tortured human being first and foremost . this measured approach is surprising not just because write-director julian schnabel is a first-time film-maker , or because he was a friend of the film's subject , haitian-american artist jean-michel basquiat ( jeffrey wright ) , but because schnabel himself is an artist of no small renown . it has been a characteristic of the works of artists-turned-auteurs ( including andy warhol's and the ugly recent example of robert longo's johnny mnemonic ) that you could expect to find very little beyond the images . schnabel does create some extremely arresting images , including a sharp opening title sequence underscored by the pogues , but he has also left no doubt that this is a film about _someone_ , about some_thing_ . basquiat is a film full of vibrant characters , none more so than jean-michel basquiat himself . jeffrey wright , a tony award-winning stage actor , gives a stunning performance as basquiat , a lonely wraith who always seems to be hovering just on the edge of coherence . but schnabel also manages to show how absurdly easy art came to basquiat . indeed , when he is creating is the only time he does not seem to be suffering . it is also impressive that schnabel is savvy and confident enough to acknowledge the flaws of his own milieu , and the perceptions of the general public towards that milieu . the battle to represent basquiat is sometimes presented in melodramatic terms , with the artist forgetting the little people as he hits the big time , but schnabel doesn't gloss over the cult of personality of the art world . he adds the year's second superb portrayal of andy warhol , with david bowie perhaps providing even more clever detachment than jared harris's work in i shot andy warhol . watch also for a marvelous scene in which christopher walken plays a journalist interviewing basquiat , trying to bait him with subtle jabs at abstract modern art ; he speaks for everyone convinced that art is an elaborate con . there are a few clumsy moments in the structure of basquiat , notably the presentation of his relationship with another aspiring artist ( claire forlani ) , and the first half of the film is rather sluggishly paced . still , for a newcomer to film , julian schnabel is remarkably assured . basquiat is not about art as torture . "
1837,"screenplay : douglas mcgrath . director : douglas mcgrath . she was the lead character in a smart and utterly charming 1994 film called clueless , although she was never expressly named , and that makes emma an experience of intense deja vu , even more so given the spate of recent adaptations of other jane austen novels . that places everyone involved with emma in positions of uncomfortable but inevitable immediate comparison -- director douglas mcgrath trying to portray upper class life in 19th century england as artfully as sense and sensibility's ang lee , gwyneth paltrow competing with alicia silverstone for brattish adorability , and so on . given these challenges , emma becomes almost more entertaining than it already is on its own merits , another witty and winning addition to the austen canon , in which paltrow becomes a bona fide leading lady . as i considered gwyneth paltrow's performance in emma , i recalled an old george carlin routine in which he concluded that the reason dogs were more expressive than cats was that dogs had eyebrows . this observation in no way means to compare paltrow to a dog ( far from it , though that is another kettle of hormones entirely ) , but to describe why i think paltrow may be the most expressive young actress working : in short , she has phenomenal eyebrows . if it seems i am doing an injustice to her ability to interpret a line , or to her impressive british accent , i do not mean to do so . it is simply that there are moments in emma where paltrow adopts a facial expression so utterly perfect that her infuriating ability to make you care about her despite her pettiness and manipulation seems drawn from the soul of austen's novel . there are actors in films today that it is distressingly clear will never know how to act with a degree of subtlety which allows a shift of the eye or a hint of a frown to advance their character . at the ripe old age of 22 , gwyneth paltrow gives a clinic on acting for the screen in emma . it is a blessing that she is able to do so , since she has to carry much of the first half of the film . mcgrath's rookie direction is somewhat static , and the harriet-emma-mr . elton triangle is hampered by a surprisingly stuffy performance by toni collette . it is the late introduction of frank churchill and mr . elton's new wife ( juliet stevenson ) which kick-starts emma into enough energy to match its cleverness . emma finds a match of another kind in mrs . elton , a self-obsessed busybody whom emma comes to dislike intensely , perhaps because they are too much alike , and juliet stevenson plays the part of the shrew with a casual good humor which undercuts the stereotype . and i would be remiss in not pointing out the delightful performances by sophie thompson as the garrulous spinster miss bates and jeremy northam as the dashing mr . knightley . but mcgrath's screenplay is a gem of humor and sparkling characterizations , and is more than faithful to the spirit of his source material . most importantly , he has cast his lead role with a keen sense of its challenges -- he needed an actor with a willingness to play a vain , foolish and snobbish young woman without winking at us to make sure we don't dislike her . she trusts her ability to make emma's good heart shine through her youthful conviction in her own infallibility , and mcgrath is wise to trust her as well . both prove far from clueless in that respect .

1838,"screenplay : john herzfeld . director : john herzfeld . running time : 100 minutes . the thing that goes dreadfully wrong with so many twisty-turny suspense yarns is that they operate under the mis-guided impression that they need nothing _except_ twists and turns to be engaging , a perfect example being the recent the rich man's wife . it is a variation on the kind of lazy , cynical film-making which produces action films like twister , in which the writers and directors hope that they can keep jerking us around to the point where we don't notice that there aren't any people in their films . i expected 2 days in the valley to be that kind of film , yet another hipper-than-thou exercise in violence and vacuity . but writer-director john herzfeld has put together a complex plot in which -- get this -- the characters actually matter , and which has more great roles for actors than a dozen recent hollywood films put together . there are some aspects of 2 days in the valley which are reminiscent of other recent stabs at hard-boiled avant garde , and for a while they concerned me . yet as john herzfeld's story unfolded , i began to find myself drawn into his characterizations , and to realize that this was one of those rare films where even minor players seemed to have a life of their own . that one scene speaks volumes about teddy , about the embittered actor , and about hollywood's loathing of failure , and it is typical of the economy with which herzfeld is able to deliver fully-formed characters . mazursky's teddy is one of the two pivotal characters in 2 days in the valley , and his performance is superb , particularly early in the film . his relationship with his dog makes for one of the most touching scenes i have seen this year , as his life is saved quite literally by the love of his pet , and mazursky's puffy , defeated demeanor is perfect . danny aiello is equally sharp as a wiseguy with something to prove , and a bigger heart than anyone expects . they are surrounded by winning performances -- even spader achieves a surprising level of capricious menace -- but mazursky and aiello are always at the center of a film which gives you the opportunity to care about the people in it . i should make something very clear at this point : 2 days in the valley is smartly plotted , with enough unexpected detours to satisfy the most die-hard lovers of cinematic guessing games . it never strays particularly far from the conventions of gritty pot-boilers , including plenty of gratuitous sex and violence , and even one heck of a brutal cat-fight between hatcher and charlize theron as lee's ice queen girlfriend . . what is surprising about 2 days in the valley is that after every twist has played itself out , it is not the twists which are memorable . it is a genuinely human redemption story wrapped in a dark , violent thriller . if herzfeld leaves a few loose ends , i was willing to forgive him because he trusted an audience with a character-driven film in a plot-driven genre . that is a twist i was not expecting .

1839,"screenplay : andy wachowski , larry wachowski . producers : andrew lazar , stewart boros . running time : 108 minutes . it's always the same old story : there's a poor sap just out of the joint , just trying to make a buck to get by . there's money as part of the bargain . yep , it's the same old story . . . except you might expect bound to try to cruise along on little more than its gender-bending premise , but you would be wrong . bound is a wickedly entertaining thriller with a gloriously manic performance by joe pantoliano , and it doesn't need gimmicks to succeed . the first act of bound sticks quite close to the standard film noir formula story line outlined above , complete with femme fatale violet seducing corky with drinks and double-entendre , corky engaging in suspicious second-guessing , and a partnership in crime which seems less than entirely trustworthy . gershon ( showgirls ) , sporting lips so full she seems unable to close her mouth entirely , makes an acceptable stand-in for the usual male dumb lug , with just a touch of bogart's world-weary cynicism . i suppose the thing that makes bound particularly satisfying is that it is simply a very good thriller -- suspenseful , unpredictable , well-acted and stylishly directed . on one level , i suppose you could argue that the lesbian angle is unnecessary , and that the wachowskis include it simply for titillation value , but it is precisely because it is unnecessary that i think it is so noteworthy . bound would have been just as effective if corky had been a man , or if caesar had been a woman , or if all three main characters had been men . it was not all that long ago that film-makers began talking about "" color-blind casting , "" choosing actors not because their race or ethnicity was intrinsic to the roles but because they were the best actors available for those roles . in bound , gina gershon makes a sharp little suspense thriller that much more intriguing by being perhaps the first example of "" sexuality-blind casting .

1841,"director : ron howard . screenplay : richard price and alexander ignon . director of photography : piotr sobocinski . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 121 minutes . i should note before anything else that ransom is not a spectacular , classic piece of film-making , but simply a very well-crafted action/suspense thriller . it is only because so many of its genre contemporaries have been so lackluster that ransom begins to look like a jewel , because ransom is a textbook example of the little things which so many bad to mediocre suspense thrillers could do to become better by orders of magnitude . in fact , the conventional wisdom in hollywood -- borne out by the success of twister , the rock and independence day as recent examples -- is that suspense is actually counter-productive because the establishment of suspense takes time , valuable minutes which will not involve a 10 megaton explosion or a flying computer-generated cow . ransom is consistently tense because it is patient , patient enough to set up characters and situations in a way which really pays off . desperate to even the odds , tom takes drastic and risky action to put the kidnapers on the defensive , the result of which can only be either complete victory or the worst kind of defeat . ransom begins with the radical premise that its characters actually matter , and uses that premise to build a story which matters from moment to moment . mullen is far from a shining knight as our protagonist , but rather a hard-nosed and occasionally unscrupulous businessman whose rebellious stand against the kidnapers is perhaps as much a result of guilt as logic . these are not spectacularly complex characters -- rene russo's kate is actually something of a disappointment as the wife who does little but sob -- but they are real people , and they are directed by ron howard in scenes which allow you inside their heads at critical , decisive moments . howard also has the ability to take moments which in other hands might have been quickly dispatched plot points and make them compelling . the story would have progressed without the lengthy sequence in which tom and kate realize that sean is missing , but the tension and mounting dread in howard's direction are palpable . even minor details like the first notification from the kidnapers -- a jittery video file sent to the mullens via email -- is given a spark which elicits a gasp from the audience . ransom does have its obligatory moments of action and violence , but howard refuses to treat those sequences as the purpose for his movie . there is a driving tension and a natural rhythm to the structure of ransom which doesn't make it feel like the director and screenwriters are trying to exhaust you with set pieces . although there are flashy moments in ransom , notably a telephone confrontation between jimmy and tom which is edited to whiplash perfection , it is notable in its lack of devotion to flash ; it is that rare action thriller where you anticipate the moment the characters _start_ talking instead of the moment they _stop_ . ransom may cop out on giving us a climax which addresses the more unsavory aspects of tom's character , but it deserves recognition as an example of professionalism in film-making , of what is possible when someone seems to give a damn . too many thrillers swing for the fences every time up , and end up striking out most of the time .

1843,"mpaa rating : not rated ( graphic depictions of corpses , profanity ) running time : 150 minutes . such are the vagaries of critical opinion , that temporal beast , that i found my experience of joe berlinger and bruce sinofsky's documentary both enhanced and diminished by recent pervasive coverage of high-profile murder cases . as a carefully constructed detective story , paradise lost is riveting ; as a study of small town america at its best and its worst , it is compelling . however , as an examination of publicly-aired grief and suspicion of the criminal justice system , it is merely exemplary rather than extraordinary . damien , an occult-fascinated , heavy metal-listening eccentric , is particularly tailor-made for prosecution , but there are potential problems with the case . there also happens to be virtually no physical evidence , and plenty to suggest that the crimes may have occurred somewhere beside the muddy ditch where the bodies were found . the first half hour of paradise lost introduces us to a fascinating cast of characters , and to a setting which is as critical to the case as any piece of evidence . hovering over the proceedings like a dark angel is the film's most enigmatic figure , damien echols -- a perceptive , self-absorbed and vaguely frightening young man who is like a satanist from central casting . the courtroom scenes are rife with the kind of confrontations familiar from both fictional and real-life proceedings , but the knowledge of its reality makes every unexpected revelation all the more enthralling . then new bits of evidence keep exploding like land mines . it is a case of such complexity that any amateur juror who has railed against noteworthy verdicts should be forced to watch paradise lost as a civics lesson . the courtroom drama of paradise lost is certainly intriguing , but i think the film spends a bit too much time in the courtroom , because the actual evidence is only half the story . outrage against the concept of presumed innocence just isn't news in this age , and paradise lost simply underlines this trend rather than exposing it . that is not to diminish its power -- paradise lost will have you asking yourself questions long after it ends . perhaps by the time i reach my own personal verdict , its power will have overwhelmed its familiarity entirely .

1844,"screenplay : kenneth branagh , based on the play by william shakespeare . director : kenneth branagh . kenneth branagh's hamlet is the first film version of shakespeare's revered tragedy to use the full , uncut text , and you know what that means : before you settle into your theater seat , smoke 'em if you got 'em , be sure to use the restroom , and bring extra quarters for parking . this hamlet is 238 minutes long -- 258 including the intermission -- making it one of the longest films ever produced for theatrical distribution . it is a terribly risky undertaking , but branagh has proven once again that the bard is safe in his hands . his hamlet does a remarkable job of demonstrating exactly how much is lost in edited versions of the play , re-vitalizing characterizations and offering a visual spectacle . it is a worthy challenger to laurence olivier's 1948 hamlet as the definitive film interpretation of the text . that bare bones synopsis cannot even begin to do justice to the complexity of hamlet , of course , but neither do many abbreviated film and stage versions . branagh's use of the entire text proves to be far more than a purist conceit , as he reveals additional layers of meaning . this hamlet is richer than any other you might have known because every piece of sub-text remains in the text . it is also a version which uses the unique opportunities of cinema better than any other . branagh has an instinct for excess in his film direction , but his dedication to shakespeare has anchored his adaptations of henry v and much ado about nothing where mary shelley's frankenstein and dead again occasionally got away from him . combining creative interpretive choices for the characters ( polonius [richard briers] becomes more malevolent and hypocritical as he is shown with a prostitute before sending someone to check up on laertes in france ) with superb technical credits ( tim harvey's dazzling production design and alex byrne's elegant , evocative 19th century costumes ) , branagh adds another thoroughly cinematic shakespeare to his resume . his direction may be nearly unimpeachable , but there are other areas where branagh's "" more is more "" philosophy are a hindrance . the casting of several familiar faces in minor roles feels more like a stunt than an artistic choice , and while crystal and charlton heston ( as the player king ) in particular are surprisingly effective in their roles , the effect is more often to turn hamlet into a hollywood sight-seeing tour : "" look , there's gerard depardieu ! look , there's robin williams ! "" branagh's lead performance is also distracting , and not because he makes poor character choices ( unless his bleached-blond hair counts ) ; the problem is that he is playing to the balcony even though he is on a movie screen . there may be one too many scenes in which spittle flies from the thin lips of his impassioned hamlet , and while branagh has a firm grasp of the dane's lighter side , his emoting is often forced . still , it is hard to come down too hard on a man who not only committed himself to the most challenging role in the history of theater , but directed an epic period production of the most challenging play in the history of theater . branagh took an exceptional gamble , and it paid off in an exceptional film . take a chance on spending 238 minutes to stretch your understanding of this remarkable play ; you can always stretch your legs during the intermission .

1845,"screenplay : scott alexander and larry karaszewski . director : milos forman . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , sexual situations , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 130 minutes . the people vs . larry flynt is such an intriguing and entertaining film biography that it is almost a shame that it had to have a "" message . "" milos forman's study of "" hustler "" magazine publisher larry flynt is an examination of the challenge of accepting potentially offensive material as protected speech under the constitution , and as such it is not in the same class as solemnly liberal films which congratulate themselves for championing radical notions like "" racism is a bad thing . "" still , there is a slickness to the way flynt's legal battles are portrayed which makes it too easy to choose sides . larry flynt soars . screenwriters scott alexander and larry karaszewski also wrote the script for tim burton's ed wood , and flynt demonstrates once again that they have a marvelous sense for crafting structure out of eccentricity . flynt is rendered variously as a libertine capitalist selling what america is buying , as a half-hearted christian convert and as a bitter , unpredictable paraplegic , yet every facet of his character becomes part of a fascinating whole in woody harrelson's performance . it is a dynamic piece of acting : sly and blisteringly funny one moment , quiet and emotional the next . few actors can muster that kind of fearlessness . the people vs . larry flynt is frequently hilarious as it explores the characters' relationships and challenging in its reluctance to offer embraceable heroes . when it hits the courtrooms , the lines become more clearly drawn , to the film's detriment . giving flynt's enemies a face which is easy to laugh at diffuses the point of the film when it is no longer "" the people "" who are versus flynt , but simply some nasty stuffed shirts . flynt's speech is deserving of protection not because he is better than his accusers , but because it shouldn't matter who is better ; when flynt tells reporters that a victory for him would be important because he is "" the worst , "" it is fairly obvious that alexander , karaszewski and forman don't agree . all the legal wranglings come to a thrilling conclusion , however , in what may be the best courtroom scene i have ever seen . at that moment , the issues at the heart of the people vs . larry flynt matter profoundly , with norton's passionate defense shattering the earlier dichotomies of right vs . wrong . it made me more disappointed in an earlier scene in which flynt gives a sincere speech to civil libertarians which is presented without a hint of irony . larry flynt , manic smut-peddler , makes for a much more compelling protagonist than larry flynt , first amendment hero .

"" in rosewood , we have the opportunity to get to know the inhabitants of both sumner and rosewood as individuals , compounding the tragedy even as it makes the triumphs more affecting . the great success of rosewood is that it turns its story into broader commentary on how racism functions without sacrificing that story . many of the individual images in rosewood are riveting , portraying unromanticized violence and pastoral beauty with equal effectiveness thanks to the impressive cinematography of johnny e . jensen . then , beyond the events of the principal narrative , you begin to notice that rosewood is presenting one of the most complex examinations of racism ever committed to film . characters are not presented in black-and-white in their views of black and white . it is one of the film's most chilling moments when the mob acknowledges with a chuckle that no one really believes a black man assaulted the notably promiscuous fannie . for them , a lynch mob isn't even about some perverted notion of justice . it's just how the world is . it's worth sticking through to the ending because in rosewood , the ending is actually a sort of beginning . though we only need to look at headlines to understand that rosewood sometimes is about the way the world still is , it is also about the way the world could be .

1847,"director : mike newell . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , brief nudity , sexual situations ) running time : 125 minutes . at first glance , lefty ruggiero ( al pacino ) seems like a dozen movie mobsters you have seen before , like a dozen movie mobsters pacino has played before . don't judge lefty , or donnie brasco , by that first impression , though lefty himself might have preferred it . as it turns out , the domestic drama in donnie brasco is actually the least interesting aspect of the film . anne heche is stuck with the thankless "" long-suffering wife "" role , with predictable lines in predictable scenes ; it's hard to imagine anyone giving an interesting spin to a line like "" you're becoming like them . "" depp's performance is solid and under-stated , a welcome shift from his string of saintly eccentrics . the reason those scenes are most frustrating , though , is that lefty is so much more fascinating a character than joseph/donnie . al pacino has often been prone to bigger-is-better style of acting , but in donnie brasco he harnesses that impulse to turn in his best performance in at least fifteen years . as we watch lefty fold in on himself in disappointment -- compounded by the fact that he believes donnie has stabbed him in the back to earn sonny's favor -- it is impossible not to feel sympathy for him . pacino's performance is sweet , crude , funny and haunted , and gives donnie brasco an unexpected emotional pull . lefty's hard life is made all the more tragic by the way organized crime is portrayed . under the direction of mike newell ( four weddings and a funeral ) , donnie brasco doesn't crackle with the same energy as films set in this world made by scorsese or depalma , but it is a different impression of mob life newell and gifted screenwriter paul attanasio ( quiz show ) are after . where other films have made mob life seem terribly attractive and glamorous , donnie brasco shows it as petty and tedious . they are more like inter-office bickering gone haywire , and the rare ( but extremely graphic ) moments of violence leave everyone's hands dirty . the beauty of attanasio's script -- and pacino's performance -- are that they make lefty's dedication to his role as lowest man in the lowest crew something touching . "
1848,"the sum total of my direct familiarity with howard stern , including the 110 minutes of private parts , now stands at about 114 minutes . before seeing the film i had not read his book , had never heard his radio program , and seen him only in passing as a guest on t . v . talk shows or on his own e ! entertainment television program . i knew stern only indirectly , as a much-reviled icon of all things excessive and an object of adoration for devoted fan base , but i did not know enough about him to have a real opinion . i suspect that mine was the best possible point of entry for private parts , because i was expecting neither to hate it nor to revel in vulgarity . without the burden of preconceptions , i was free to laugh myself silly at a completely unexpected delight . it's hard to say who may be more surprised at private parts -- stern's fans or his detractors -- because it is funny in almost every possible way : at times goofy and low key , at times undeniably outrageous . the savvy edge of private parts really should not have been a surprise considering betty thomas was in the director's chair . thomas previously did sharp work with the brady bunch movie and hbo's talk show wars docu-comedy the late shift , proving herself adept with the worlds of media and pop culture , and she manages to put a surprising amount of energy into scenes of people sitting around talking into microphones . some of those scenes are simply brilliant , including the attempt by a flustered kenny ( a wonderfully slimy performance by paul giamatti ) to stop stern's broadcast of an off-color parody of "" match game . "" thomas' most impressive achievement , however , may be taking a group of radio personalities -- including stern's cohorts robin quivers and fred norris -- and putting them in situations where they could be comfortable . norris in particular has some hilarious moments , notably in a sequence in a b-movie actress's hotel room where he steals every scene hardly saying a word . it may not be a tremendous challenge to make an acting debut playing yourself , but stern makes the character he plays something you might never expect : charming . probably not . there's certainly a contradiction between stern's announcement to alison prior to the emergence of the now-recognizable stern persona that he's going to "" be myself , "" and the disingenuous suggestion that he's just playing a character on the air ; the truth probably exists somewhere in the middle . it does grow a bit tiresome hearing howard bemoan how misunderstood he is , and the film slows down considerably whenever he feels obliged once again to show us his sensitive side . private parts is much funnier when stern laughs at himself , or when he does the things that make other people laugh at him . still , it's no easy trick to please stern's fans while placating his enemies , and private parts serves up raunchiness and bad taste in a slick and snappy package . no matter how much of howard stern you've seen , this is a howard stern you haven't seen .

1849,"screenplay : tom jankewicz and d . v . devincentis & steve pink and john cusack . producers : susan arnold , donna arkoff roth and roger birnbaum . director : george armitage . grosse pointe blank has been bumped from hollywood pictures' release schedule a couple of times , but for once it appears that the delays had nothing to do with production over-runs or shabby quality . my guess is that the marketing people just kept asking for more time to figure out how in the world to sell this thing . when john cusack is your biggest star , the director's previous film ( miami blues ) was seen by next to no one seven years ago and the tone defies even its cute high-concept premise , you'd probably be stumped too . and no matter how they try to sell grosse pointe blank , they won't do it justice . grosse pointe blank is wildly unpredictable , wonderfully detailed and unapologetically intelligent , a comedy which takes the time to do the little things right and gets big laughs in the process . cusack plays martin blank , a killer-for-hire facing an existential crisis . john cusack is one of four credited writers for a script which boasts one of the characteristics of the best screen comedies : every minor character is a fully-realized comic creation . the exchanges between these characters are sharp and clever , rich with sometimes overlapping dialogue which actually requires the audience to pay attention . the punch lines never come quite when or how you expect them , taking deadly satirical aim at targets like organized labor , suburbia , assassin etiquette and that strange american ritual called the high school reunion . at the relatively calm center of this colorful comic hurricane is john cusack , who adds grosse pointe blank to an impressive resume of smart projects like say anything , the grifters , and bullets over broadway . his self-deprecating wit and baby-faced , sad-eyed attractiveness make him an instantly sympathetic screen presence , and cusack has to fight against his persona a bit to give martin the killer instinct he requires . the script gradually reveals bits of martin's history which explain how he became who he is , without sacrificing the comedy for an unnecessarily serious character study . it's a deft piece of acting by cusack , who has an easy chemistry with minnie driver ( in perhaps the least well-developed role ) which convincingly evokes a sense of history and familiarity . as absurd as the situations get in grosse pointe blank , the film never becomes a farce because cusack plays martin's quest for enlightenment as honest and honorable . . . even if he has to stab someone in the throat with a ball point pen along the way . oh , yes . . . grosse pointe blank could catch you off guard if you are unfamiliar with the aforementioned miami blues , director george armitage's under-appreciated 1990 thriller which wasn't timid about mixing comedy , quirky characters and occasionally graphic violence . grosse point blank is a much better , much funnier film , but it does include moments of violence which are sometimes jarring in an otherwise playful film ; martin is a killer , and we see him at work as well as at play . hollywood pictures isn't doing much to warn the squeamish about those elements , preferring instead to emphasize the comedy and a gen-x-nostalgic soundtrack heavy on 1980s punk and new wave tunes by the jam , the clash and others . a bit deceptive , perhaps , but for once i'm willing to forgive the marketing folks their trespasses if they get people into theaters to see grosse pointe blank . something this disarmingly unique needs all the creative salesmanship it can get .

1850,"producers : martha delaurentiis and dino delaurentiis . director : jonathan mostow . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 95 minutes . even critics can fall into the same trap of equating the idea with the complete film . when a film with a familiar premise appears , you're likely to see dismissive reviews which perpetuate the notion that the real culprit is lack of originality , rather than lack of craft . of course , by those standards william shakespeare would be the most reviled plagiarist of all time -- how dare he steal his plots from antiquity , from english history , from other writers ? . a great idea works , but it can work more than once . it's the mark of a talented artist when he can take that recognizable idea and make it something original and exciting . take breakdown , for instance . the malevolent trucker and desert landscapes owe a debt to steven spielberg's duel , and there is a recognizably hitchockian quality to russell's ordinary guy in extraordinary circumstances . all of this might have left me shaking my head , if breakdown hadn't been so good at leaving me shaking all over . breakdown is as viscerally effective as any thriller hollywood has turned out in the last few years , because mostow understands what works . the hero is a slightly paunchy everyman , smart and resourceful enough for us to believe he has a chance at survival , and kurt russell does a nice job keeping the anger and determination from becoming one-note . the situation is just plausible and unnerving enough to get under your skin , with a creeping sense of paranoia which could affect the audience as much as it affects jeff . walsh in particular has the chilling ability to make a word into a weapon , and to make a stare as brutal as any of the pistol-whippings which permeate breakdown . over and above all that , mostow demonstrates a keen sense for how to construct a gripping , efficient thriller . the opening half hour is a subtle rumble of mounting dread , which in turn becomes a roller-coaster series of set pieces , which in turn becomes an all-stops-pulled finale , all in the course of 95 minutes . breakdown is most definitely intended as a crowd-pleaser , peppered as it is with frequent opportunities for the audience to cheer jeff turning the tables on his tormenters . it is also a remarkably effective crowd-pleaser , one which doesn't throw common sense or continuity to the wind for the sake of a punch line . by the time breakdown builds to a climactic four-car chase -- a somewhat excessive conclusion to an otherwise lean thriller -- mostow has demonstrated a rare talent for grabbing an audience and refusing to let go . there is another stolen idea in breakdown which isn't entirely mostow's doing . advertising for the film ominously warns "" it could happen to you , "" a nod to thrillers which became pop culture phenomena by appealing to our collective 20th-century conviction that every stranger is a serial killer waiting to happen -- call this one the "" good samaritan truck driver from hell . "" mostow actually goes a bit farther , playing the conflict in breakdown as class warfare , and it is disappointing to watch such a solid film resort to back-brain prejudices . if you think about breakdown long enough , you'll probably discover some things which bother you -- why , for instance , jeff didn't seem at all concerned about his wife riding with a stranger , or why the villains seem to thwart their own plan at the outset . you may even think about the fact that you've seen something like breakdown before . and it may not matter , because the idea is only the frame for a vehicle . jonathan mostow has given this one an engine with a heck of a kick .

"" it's a peter greenaway type of stunt from a rookie director ( streitfeld is a rehabilitated . . . sorry , those characters , and eve's interactions with them , really are the "" plot "" of female perversions . each one feels like something which began as a case study but grew into a unique and fully-realized individual . the performances -- by amy madigan , karen sillas , even paulina porizkova -- are uniformly superb , taking snapshots of different women coping with life and giving them unexpected vitality . it is a performance so rich and detailed that it feels like part of a documentary . and what a face it is .

1852,"screenplay : victor nunez . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 115 minutes . if you can name two other peter fonda films since then , you have my deepest sympathies ; it probably means you sat through delights like wanda nevada . the broad forehead , the determined chin and the stoic demeanor are all eerily reminiscent of another film fonda . it's not just in his physical appearance that peter resembles papa henry . at first , helen's predicament does not move ulee in the least . one of the riskier steps writer/director victor nunez takes is making ulee fairly unlikeable at the outset , and not unlikeable in that fussy , irrascible but ultimately good-hearted hollywood way . like nunez's 1993 gem ruby in paradise , ulee's gold is about a journey of self-discovery , not exactly a high-concept premise . nunez's particular gift as both a writer and a director is the ability to convey the struggles of troubled souls without resorting to melodramatic situations or hyperbolic speeches . the most spectacular thing about peter fonda's performance is exactly that it is so unspectacular , a textbook study of dramatic economy . this stubborn , driven , hard-working man is not entirely pleasant to be around , but he's fascinating and thoroughly human . the action in fonda's lined face is more compelling than a shootout in the swamps . ulee's gold is exactly the kind of film some people get suspicious about when the critics go ga-ga , primarily because it is the kind of film critics are _expected_ to go ga-ga over . as a casually-paced , character-driven drama in the middle of summer , it certainly stands out in a crowd , but it is not a flawless masterpiece . nunez has a tendency to devote almost all his creative energy to his main character , leaving his supporting players far less to work with . there are moments when ulee's gold starts to wander , when the languid character interactions are merely slow instead of meaningful . still , one fascinating , carefully-constructed character is one more than almost any other film of the last few months has taken the time to give us . in a way , that makes ulee's gold just as rebellious a film as easy rider was in its time .

1853,"screenplay : mike webb and michael colleary . director : john woo . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 135 minutes . they don't wear masks of one another or impersonate one another -- they actually , physically exchange faces . the premise is , of course , absolutely ridiculous . it also is absolutely brilliant , and incredibly subversive . hollywood film-making is built around the idea of the star , around the idea that the audience is always and automatically on the side of the star . it's not necessary to write an interesting character for arnold schwarzenegger , because the people in the audience aren't expected to be rooting for the character . they're rooting for arnold schwarzenegger , the actor , the star . face/off , ridiculous though its premise might be , demands the creation of compelling characters . for the first forty minutes , john travolta plays sean archer , the tormented hero who has the audience's sympathy . the only way viewers can transfer their allegiance is if they spent the first forty minutes rooting for sean archer , not john travolta . to make face/off work , director john woo had to hand mike webb and michael colleary's sharp script to a couple of movie stars who could act , who could transcend persona for the demands of a dual role . both travolta and cage are in fine form in face/off , tearing up scenery with eye-popping relish when playing castor or seething with intensity as archer . of the two , cage has the greater challenge , and pulls off the more impressive transformation . travolta , meanwhile , proves that an action film with thematic depth can still be a whole lot of fun , riffing on cage's manic acting style and offering self-deprecating observations about his own "" ridiculous chin . "" woo delivers the kind of surging action summer movie-goers have come to expect , while adding touches they probably don't expect : evocative musical interludes , confident pacing and -- wonder of wonders -- an actual script . woo has always loved his action on a grand scale -- grand opera , actually -- but the final ten minutes of face/off are just a bit much , especially at the tail end of 135 minutes of running time . perhaps woo , who built a loyal following by filling his hong kong action films with stories of guilt , family ties and redemption , was so excited to be making this kind of film in america that he just didn't want it to end . he certainly pulls of a neat trick in face/off , investing a conventional genre with unconventional resonance . he also challenges the star system of 1990s hollywood with the revolutionary notion that an audience can invest itself emotionally in the characters in the story , not just the names above the title . calling a critic 'elitist' is like calling an accountant 'mathist .

1854,"the american ad campaign for the film places jackie in a heroic pose in front of spandex-clad , gun-toting babes , a pre-opening credits sequence sets the stage with a few impressive stunts , and the opening credits themselves are full of silhouette images . anything sound familiar ? imagine , now , that in the course of mimicking one of the most iconic adventure series of the last thirty years , someone managed to improve on it . when the creative force behind the result is jackie chan , it's not a tremendous stretch of the imagination . operation condor is simply the most ridiculously entertaining action film to grace american screens this year , a dazzling combination of energetic comedy and virtuoso stunt work which shames the multi-million dollar detritus offered this summer by hollywood studios . and none of it really matters in the least , except to the extent that it provides a set-up for action sequences . that structure doesn't distinguish it much from most late-model bond films , or from the majority of late-model action films of any make . what does distinguish operation condor is the action it delivers -- not just big , loud and expensive action but inventive , thrilling and beautifully choreographed action . a jackie chan fight sequence can do something absolutely extraordinary in the jaded age of the blockbuster : it makes action seem original . you may spend half of operation condor's running time -- particularly the spectacular wind tunnel finale -- wearing the goofy expression of someone who can't believe he just saw that . you may spend the other half enjoying the presence of chan himself , though the bond analogy certainly breaks down at this point . chan is a lot of things on screen , but suave ain't one of them . you get the feeling you'd be more likely to see him in a cardigan and slippers than in an armani tuxedo ; he's like mr . rogers if he could do a spinning back kick . ( my apologies , fred , if you _can_ do a spinning back kick . ) yet it is exactly that polite , boyish charm which makes chan such a great action hero . he's in on the absurd joke of action films , but not in the raised eyebrow , quip-spewing way which passes for wit in other genre entries . chan is willing simply to laugh at himself , at the idea of a vulnerable nice guy who defeats his opponents with grace and style rather than with an uzi . there are a few clumsy transitions in operation condor , many the result of editing which trimmed almost twenty minutes from the original cut of armour of god ii , as well as predictably stiff supporting performances and grossly caricatured accents in the dubbed voices . operation condor is _fun_ , fun in a way which should make people embarrassed for using the same word to describe con air or the lost world . if i were pierce brosnan , i'd be looking over my shoulder right about now . chan . calling a critic 'elitist' is like calling an accountant 'mathist .

1855,"when people learn in social settings that i am a film critic , two inevitable questions arise . the first -- "" so what's good ?

1856,"long before its release , fox's anastasia was greeted with some strangely familiar skeptical remarks . "" the execution of the romanovs ? "" "" not exactly the stuff for an animated film , is it ? "" similar words greeted disney's pocahontas a couple of years ago , and that film went on to take a criticaly pasting for not being enough "" fun . "" journalists and studios have formed an odd tag-team perpetuating the notion that an animated film with adult subject matter is just a waste of time between the happy meal characters . while television has produced smart animation for grown-ups like "" the simpsons , "" "" king of the hill , "" "" dr . it's like folks don't like their cartoons gettin' uppity . anastasia is not , i repeat , _not_ a great film for kids . it is , however , a visually rich and extremely well-constructed story which shows a little nerve . at its least inventive , anastasia attempts merely to follow the successful disney plan for animated features . most of the comic relief shows up during rasputin's scenes , yet they also hinder the narrative . the villain doesn't contribute to anastasia's most interesting elements ; he's around because , darn it , you've _got_ to have a villain around in an animated film . that assumption is based on the "" kids first "" paradigm , one which anastasia doesn't follow most of the time . the characterizations of anya and dmitri are effective without being over-wrought ; their developing relationship is sketched out in smart , subtle scenes . the character animation seems somehow richer than most of disney's recent efforts , giving the characters more life ( anya's unconventional features are worth extra attention ) . yet anastasia may be most intriguing because , unlike disney's features , it feels like a genuine _musical_ , not simply a film with songs attached . when anastasia breaks into song , it's like you're watching an ambitious stage production . it also comes with an unusual but dynamic animation style which combines conventional hand-drawn characters with computer-generated backgrounds . though the juxtapositions don't always work , the effect is stunning when they do . anastasia also serves up a few genuinely creepy images , the kinds you'd associate with ralph bakshi more than with uncle walt . though disney has managed to make a couple of films as satisfying for parents as they were for their children ( beauty and the beast , for certain ) , no recent disney film has felt quite as mature as anastasia . fox , quite predictably , is still marketing anastasia as a family film , and there's not exactly anything which would be considered objectionable . it just seems a shame that anastasia _had_ to become a children's film when this material could have been turned into a spectacular drama unencumbered by cute puppies or talking bats . it's time for someone to take a look at the ratings for television's animation for grown-ups and take a chance . come on , we can handle it . after all , we're not kids any more . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1861,"director : steven soderbergh . no previous adaptation of an elmore leonard novel -- and there have been a couple of pretty good ones recently in get shorty and jackie brown -- has captured the author's unique flavor as effectively as out of sight . though leonard usually writes about criminal characters , he doesn't exactly write crime novels ; though his stories are often quite funny , he doesn't exactly write comic novels ; though his narratives always come together in a way that makes sense , he doesn't exactly let tight plotting get in the way of an amusing tangent . leonard is his own literary animal : sometimes sordid , sometimes smirking , always sly . you'll find every one of those contradictions and then some in out of sight , a marvelously meandering caper with rhythms all its own . surprisingly , the ride proves intriguing to both parties . out of sight certainly works best as a quirky comedy , with screenwriter scott frank ( who also adapted get shorty ) providing great material for a superb supporting cast . steve zahn steals every one of his scenes as jack and buddy's perpetually stoned accomplice glenn , channeling crispin glover with considerably more appealing goofiness . there are even a couple of sharp unbilled cameos , including michael keaton reprising his jackie brown character and a final-scene appearance by another veteran of a previous leonard adaptation . good scripts make even mediocre actors look better ; frank's script in the hands of these actors is a hilarious gem . but out of sight isn't just a comedy . it's also a love story , if a very odd one . clooney has never looked more comfortable or charismatic on the big screen , nor has lopez , for that matter . with a clever nod to the fast-attraction nature of film romances ( in a reference to the redford-dunaway thriller three days of the condor ) , out of sight gets maximum mileage out of the pairing of its stars in a believable fast-attraction film romance . there are also plenty of crime caper elements mixed in with the comedy and romance , including no small amount of bloodshed , but even then the film seems entirely cohesive . credit director steven soderbergh with crafting a distinctive , unifying look and feel from frank's deftly back-tracking script . most frequently he employs an abrupt freeze-framing device , usually to mark transitions between scenes and locations . in soderbergh's capable hands the freeze-frames never feel gimmicky , instead playing as chapter stops on leonard's snappy punch lines . there's nothing particularly deep or intensely memorable about out of sight -- indeed , the pace flags a bit at times as it tries to keep up with all its characters -- but it's the kind of film that punches holes in the notion that "" entertaining "" and "" smart "" are mutually exclusive adjectives for a summer film . this is pure pulp pleasure , the cinematic equivalent of great beach reading . . . and what better way is there to describe the work of elmore leonard ? see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1863,"director : jonathan demme . mpaa rating : r ( adult themes , nudity , sexual situations , violence ) running time : 172 minutes . beloved doesn't feel like a typical oscar-hyped fall "" prestige release , "" full of cathartic emotion and earnest dignity . its opening minutes portend something quite different : two silent exterior shots , one tracking through a graveyard and the other establishing a rural ohio home , shift to a scene of sheer supernatural terror . so much for earnest dignity ; this is a prestige release as american gothic horror film . that shouldn't be terribly surprising coming from director jonathan demme , who turned 1991's the silence of the lambs into an oscar-winning prestige release . yet this is no more a conventional thriller than it is a conventional epic drama , though it incorporates elements of both . it's what beloved does with the idea of a ghost story that made toni morrison's novel so powerful , and makes demme's film so gripping . most film-makers would have taken those events and shown them off with sincere indignation . the images created by demme and cinematographer tak fujimoto are jittery and chilling , designed more to invade the sub-conscious than to inspire tight-lipped head-shaking . with oprah winfrey effectively conveying sethe's hollow-eyed resignation , beloved shows how a tormented past can corrupt the present to the point that it feels perpetually haunted , holding meaning only as a constant reminder of unforgettable evils . if beloved had intended merely to shock and dismay , it would have been a very shallow and disspiriting experience . instead , it becomes a call to the living to dare existing in the present , conveyed through two supporting characters marvelously performed . beloved is such a side-ranging story that it's bound to feel slightly disjointed at times . the flashback to sethe's escape from sweet home feels particularly drawn out , slowing down a nearly three-hour film . it's impressive , however , that three different screenwriters could create so cohesive an adaptation . there is emotion , yes , and dignity ; there is also evil , and even horror . i can only think of one way to categorize a film like beloved : it may be the most uplifting horror film you'll ever see . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1864,"screenplay : andrew stanton and donald mcenery & bob shaw . producers : darla k . anderson and kevin reher . directors : john lasseter and andrew stanton . mpaa rating : g . running time : 95 minutes . a bug's life deserves better . it deserves better than to be held up to that other computer-animated insect film from earlier this fall . it deserves better than to be compared to that other feature from pixar . it's virtually impossible to talk about a bug's life without invoking antz and/or toy story , but it deserves better . films with this much wit , energy and imagination are too uncommon to diminish this one with such petty comparisons . a bug's life is not just a delightful computer-animated family film about insects . it's a delightful film . not that it's a perfect one . the botched circus sequence in which they are introduced recalls warner bros . cartoons at their most rapid-fire anarchic , with the cast of colorful performers all delivering laughs . though foley is a pleasant enough presence , his redemption storyline isn't nearly as interesting as the circus performers' search for an adoring audience . he serves much the same function here as he does on tv's "" newsradio , "" acting as the sane center around which more charismatic characters can do their thing . he's also the center around which the animators can do their thing , and they do more than enough things to make for a wonderful ride . the throwaway gags in flik's visit to the "" big city "" -- an annoying street mime mimicking flik's every move , a cricket panhandler with a sign announcing "" wings pulled off by kids "" -- are consistently appealing to viewers of all ages . director john lasseter has an uncanny eye for setting up a scene , and a comic sensibility most directors of live action should be willing to kill for . nowhere is that more evident than during the closing credits , when lasseter pulls out the kind of brilliant conceit that makes really good films feel like great films . miss the final five minutes at your own peril . sure , it would have been nice if a bug's life had had a story as tightly constructed as the buddy bonding of woody and buzz in toy story . it would have been nice if the lead character had had as distinctive a personality as woody allen's z in antz . those are the nit-picking details you have to come up with when a film offers as much pure fun as a bug's life . silly enough for kids , smart enough for adults , grandly-staged enough for anyone who loves movies , it offers entertainment that deserves a different kind of comparison . understand that there probably haven't been a half-dozen better films of _any_ kind this year , and you'll be on to the kind of comparison a bug's life really deserves . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1865,"screenplay : todd solondz . director : todd solondz . mpaa rating : not rated ( sexual situations , adult themes , profanity ) . running time : 135 minutes . happiness is almost too difficult to watch -- not because of its potentially shocking content , but because it's so achingly sad . stabs at romance turn into depressing one-night stands . the dozen or so principal characters in todd solondz's bleakly funny suburban nightmare fumble and fail so consistently in their pursuit of happiness you might suspect it was unattainable . and , in the sense that some of them define it , it is . solondz fills his world with people who want what they haven't got , never realizing how much it could cost them . baker gives bill so many layers that he always seems human even through his predatory calculation . his attempt to cajole billy's young friend into eating a drugged sandwich is as pathetic as it is creepy , his parental concern as genuine as it is tainted . solondz is never merely interested in the sensationalistic but trite notion that the monsters who turn up in headlines are our neighbors . it's even more unsettling that solondz sets bill at one far end of a continuum of pain selfishly inflicted in the desperate search for fulfillment . there are no grand enlightenments in happiness , which may make it seem that solondz is simply reveling in the characters' degradation . the fact is they're merely deeply flawed , some making small steps towards defining their own happiness , others too immersed in external definitions to be ready for those small steps . solondz's one real mis-step -- aside from the unnecessarily long running time -- involves a murder/rape sub-plot which launches happiness into an unnecessarily surreal direction . the film doesn't need the cheap laughs from references to cut up body parts in freezer bags , not when it offers edgy humor that's so much more uncomfortably genuine . it's brutally ironic that he's asking for advice on normalcy from a man who may be nobody's paradigm of normalcy , but at least he's receiving reassurance that he's not alone in his confusion . solondz turns what could have been a freak show into a reassurance that we , too , are not alone in being something other than "" normal .

1866,"director : anthony drazan . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , drug use , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 123 minutes . eddie ( sean penn ) , a second-tier hollywood player , is slowly realizing that hollywood is a bad place to be if you feel things too deeply . his life is a hurlyburly -- emotional turbulence occasionally interrupted by attempts at communication that come out "" blah blah blah . "" it's always in fashion to take a stab at the shallow white underbelly of tinseltowners , but hurlyburly -- adapted by david rabe from his play -- offers more than cheap shot industry-bashing . at its heart it's a study of a man who has set himself up for perpetual disappointment by being tempermentally incompatible with the people who surround him . it's a riveting performance as one of the best-written characters of the year . david rabe's writing has the familiar rhythm of another playwright named david -- mamet -- giving the dialogue the snap of exchanged gunfire . hurlyburly always feels like a film adaptation of a stage play , with the action centered at all times on character interaction , which is not to say that it's static or visually uncompelling . this is certainly a piece for actors above all , with a uniformly stellar cast -- be prepared to be surprised by meg ryan in a small role as a stripper -- but it's not a film where the camera sets up simply for people to deliver monologues . hurlyburly feels like its setting : smooth and slick , with something dark bubbling just underneath . it's easy to get caught up in one element of a film's tone , particularly if previous films on a similar subject have led you to expect that sort of tone . yes , hurlyburly is dark -- there are unhappy people who spend most of their time swearing , snorting or debasing other unhappy people , there is violence , and there is death . there are moments of raw emotion that come from unexpected places and take unexpected forms . and there is the hope that a man can remember how to care . those who see this as just another nihilistic stroll down hollywood boulevard aren't looking closely enough . hurlyburly may be talky , but the talk isn't cheap . that shallow white underbelly has rarely run this deep . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1867,"wes anderson has the kind of comic sensibility that keeps you watching just so you can see where he goes next . though the humor was often absurd , anderson and his co-writer owen wilson never sacrificed character for the sake of an easy joke . it's that same sensibility that makes rushmore such a quirky delight -- it's a uniquely oddball comedy that's still about people . it would have been easy enough for anderson to turn rushmore into an ever-escalating , bigger-must-be-funnier battle of pranks . like a typical teen , max is concerned with how others see him ; unlike a typical teen , his concern manifests itself in an obsession with grand gestures , with being perceived as important . as splendidly portrayed by first-time actor schwartzman , max's egomaniacal infatuations -- first with the school and then with miss cross -- come off as the sweetly immature behavior of a kid trying way too hard to appear mature . there's plenty immature about herman blume as well , imbued with an aura of pure defeat by bill murray . though the destructive salvos exchanged by max and blume are wonderfully funny , they're also ridiculous because of the players involved : a kid working desperately to be an adult , and an adult working desperately to be a kid . you in the sh * t ? "" ) , combining for one of the smartest comedies you'll see . anderson and wilson do bite off perhaps a few too many plot threads -- the friendship between max and his young rushmore "" chapel buddy "" ( mason gamble ) doesn't really go anywhere -- but there are so many deft comic touches that the less interesting elements are somehow diluted . at its core , the narrative of rushmore is quite conventional stuff about people who learn important lessons about what they want from life . those lessons are given such a singular presentation that you may only realize after you've stopped laughing that these people , for all their foolishness , are all the more appealing because they're real . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1868,"the castle is the kind of comedy that never could have been made in hollywood . scratch that -- it could have been made in hollywood , but it would have been a disaster . the use of a voice-over narrator would have turned into a crutch instead of a source of inspired brilliance . the working class characters might have been either salt-of-the-earth or grotesque , but never the perfect blend of both . the tale of a little guy fighting the system would have been wrapped up by a wildly cheering courtroom gallery , instead of a delightfully profane two-word summation . and the neat and tidy 82-minute running time would have been bloated by another 15 or 20 minutes . it matters little to darryl that the house is built on landfill next to the airport -- it's his home , his pride and joy , his castle . it's no small task to laugh _with_ a collection of characters and laugh _at_ them at the same time , but that's exactly what sitch and his three co-writers have accomplished . sitch turns the smiling bad taste of the kerrigans into perfectly-pitched comedy . yet it is exactly that skewed perspective that makes the castle so endearing even as it sends you rolling on the floor with laughter . michael caton's pitch-perfect performance as darryl is a portrait of brighter-side-looking that re-defines the term . it's a performance so warm that anyone who might look condescendingly at the kerrigans should feel ashamed . a man's love for what he has -- rather than envy of what he doesn't have -- has rarely felt this genuine . yet the film is never really about that battle in the way that you'd expect . there are some marvelous comic moments as darryl takes on his adversaries , but the richness of the castle comes from the fact that his victory is one of perspective even before a verdict is read . sure , in some ways it's a one-joke film , and perhaps some viewers will grow weary of that one joke . it just happens to be a joke told with the kind of skill we just don't see very often . an audience trained what to expect from comedies by hollywood will find expectations in this down under comedy turned -- most appropriately -- upside-down . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1869,"director : david fincher . mpaa rating : r ( violence , gore , profanity , sexual situations , nudity ) running time : 139 minutes . in this year of our lord 1999 , when all things millennial are hotter than the coming apocalyptic purges , i give you david fincher -- official filmmaker of the dark night of our collective 21st century soul . seven was one of the decade's most chilling visions of societal madness made flesh ; the game turned existential crisis into engrossing suspense . no one in popular culture seems to understand our demons better . no one more effectively shows the deceptive ease with which our stable world can be yanked out from under us . in his adaptation of chuck palahniuk's savagely brilliant novel fight club , fincher delves once again into the bowels of our uber-psyche -- quite literally in the propulsive , dust brothers-scored opening credits sequence -- and announces that a lot of us are walking very close to the edge . it might surprise a lot of people to discover that fight club is actually a comedy . certainly it's not a comedy in the big daddy or mickey blue eyes sense , and not just because this one is actually funny . it's a comedy like a clockwork orange was a comedy , a social satire so caustic you laugh with a sharp intake of breath . norton's wonderfully dry narration includes dozens of scathing punch lines , many of them drawn directly from palahniuk's text . and it had to be ; there's no other way to tell a story like fight club without wallowing in didacticism . many critics and social conservatives have already offered up kill-the-messenger diatribes against the film's brutality and anarchist sub-plots , yet another depressing reminder that some people need their messages delivered to them in solemn "" isn't this a very , very bad thing "" tones . at its heart , fight club is a warning about the percolating discontent that has exploded into well-publicized acts of violence in this country . it also peeks into the capacity for violent action we may not even realize we possess , the testosterone id bubbling beneath the veneer of civilization . if the approach to those subjects had ever become overtly preachy , fight club would have become a glossy social science dissertation -- a big screen version of susan faludi's emasculated-american-male study "" stiffed . "" instead , fight club taps into something primal , then takes it into the realm of the absurd -- subliminal penises , liposuction soap and all . weaving it all together is fincher , as distinctive and unconventional a filmmaker as any working in mainstream theatrical films . fight club is a kinetic work with plenty of visual flourishes and jolting sound design , yet it never feels like an all-out sensory pummeling -- it's the film oliver stone probably wanted natural born killers to be , but lacked the subtlety to pull of . the film only sags during a late surge of exposition , a necessary evil that still feels awkward . when fincher is allowed to plunge into fight club's dizzying array of themes and subtexts , the result is as provocatively entertaining a film as you could hope for . if the violence unnerves -- or becomes even more unnerving when accompanied by vicious wit -- that's only because it should . fight club keeps you off balance , its incendiary vision leavened by the unexpected humor . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1870,"screenplay/director : steven soderbergh . it's called the sophomore slump , and it's a pitfall common to all contemporary art forms . a writer has a lifetime to create the breakthrough debut , and eighteen months to create a follow-up everyone will expect to be equally good ; as just the most recent cinematic example , witness john singleton's poetic justice . if this is true of soderbergh , the evidence that this is one auteur with staying power is king of the hill , a beautiful and darkly poetic adaptation of a . e . hotchner's memoir of life during the great depression . king of the hill's greatest triumph is one of tone . as somber as the subject matter could have been , soderbergh opts neither for grittiness nor spielbergian sentimentality . none of the empire's residents are treated as pathetic or heroic ; they're simply decent people trying to do their best with what they've been given . there is as much humor as their is sadness in king of the hill , perhaps more . all are lovingly photographed by elliot davis and accented by a giddy cliff martinez score reminiscent of randy newman . to be certain , this isn't an entirely pleasant film ; there are some dark and bittersweet moments . however , the balance is maintained so that it feels ( at the risk of sounding cliche ) like life . the splendid ensemble cast only adds to the richness . heading the list is bradford , perfectly cast as the imaginative aaron . he manages to capture both a savvy born of necessity and pubescent awkwardness with understated style . of the hotel's denizens , i was particularly taken with amber benson as ella , who conveys a heartfelt desperation for contact that generates some touching scenes with aaron . also worth noting is karen allen in an appealing turn as aaron's supportive teacher . i have no frame of reference for the historical accuracy of king of the hill , but i do know that it * felt * real . there are also intriguing character types , particularly the fascistic beat cop who treats his street like a fiefdom . in short , king of the hill feels like a man's vivid memory of a difficult but enriching boyhood , told with power and grace . soderbergh has a gift for visual narrative , and it makes for an outstanding film . third time is a charm steven . keep it up .

1871,"director : david lynch . mpaa rating : g ( mild profanity ) running time : 111 minutes . in most exceptional films , there is a moment early on when you can just tell you're tapped into something special . where we see alvin's puttering rig about 100 yards from where we last saw it . i think that shot might have been one of the best of the year even if its only purpose had been as a shaggy dog joke . but it's more than that ; it's a remarkably efficient tone-setter . instantly , you know this is going to be a rather unique travelogue . you can begin to appreciate the truly inspired combination of freddie francis's cinematography and angelo badalamenti's fiddle-and-guitar road music that makes the straight story so evocative in its heartland sincerity . and you understand that slow , methodical persistence is central to this story's success -- not just in alvin's journey , but in lynch's willingness to ask his audience for some patience as the film unfolds . if you're busy rubbing your eyes incredulously , wondering if we could possibly be talking about the same david lynch who made "" twin peaks , "" blue velvet and lost highway , let me assure you that we are . we're also talking about the same david lynch who made the elephant man , another fact-based story overflowing with compassion and humanity . there may be something about working from real life that keeps lynch anchored , and it's a style that suits him well . as provocative as his more surreal films have been , they can make it difficult to appreciate what a talented director he is between the cringes and the head-scratching . in the straight story , he is more in command of his simple visual storytelling than he has ever been , which is not necessarily saying that the straight story is his best film . it's simply obvious , with none of the grotesquerie characteristic of other lynch films , that he knows exactly what works for any given story . he also knows that the straight story is more than a bunch of pretty pictures of the american midwest . richard farnsworth's performance is so low-key and naturalistic that it may not seem there's a lot going on , but alvin straight is a superbly crafted character . senior citizens rarely get the kind of showcase the straight story provides , and farnsworth does beautiful things with alvin . farnsworth does a fine job of pulling all possible sanctimony out of those scenes , but the film is still stronger when it's quiet and observant , soaring on the skills of francis and badalamenti . there's also a sly sense of humor to the straight story , including lynch's ability to poke fun at himself . it's exactly the kind of scene where lynch might have dipped into the creatures beneath the green lawn , or found some other bit of suburban horror . in the striaght story , he just tells a straight story , finding poetry in the simple reliability of a lawnmower's slow , steady journey . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1872,"screenplay : andrew stanton , rita hsiao , doug chamberlin & chris webb . producers : helene plotkin and karen robert jackson . director : john lasseter . mpaa rating : g running time : 85 minutes . there is no finer comic filmmaker working today than john lasseter . no one better understands how to choreograph an elaborate sight gag ; no one better nails the timing of comic dialogue . combine these elements with a genuine warmth and love of character , and you have one of the closest things we have to a pop culture genius in american cinema circa 1999 . incidentally , john lasseter directs computer-generated films . if you think that qualification renders such praise moot , shame on you for your short-sightedness . movies just don't get much more blissfully , intelligently entertaining than toy story and a bug's life , and i didn't think it would be possible for a sequel to approach toy story's heights of savvy family filmmaking . once again , lasseter has broadened my thinking . when you're dealing with a film like toy story 2 , it's easy to spend far too much time talking about the technology and the referrential gags . yes , the technology has improved by orders of magnitude even over the original toy story , making human characters like al an even more seamless part of the film , and making possible some dizzying , dazzling action sequences . it's a film that easily could have cruised on its cutting edge , its hipness and the good will of familiar faces . toy story soared not because it was revolutionary , but because it was a marvelously told film story -- a more human story than 90% of all films actually involving humans . the kidnap/rescue structure of toy story 2 may seem familiar , but this film may actually be a bit more resonant than the original . leave it to lasseter to turn a family film into a meditation on love : behind the pure entertainment , there's a story about broken hearts and the risks of potentially transient relationships . and in front of those themes , there's pure entertainment . it's true that toy story 2 is somewhat busier than the original , with a few too many characters to keep up with . some of the additional story elements -- like buzz encountering a naive , fresh-out-of-the-box version of himself in the toy store -- are fun but occasionally distracting . this may not be the instant classic toy story was , but it's too close to quibble . there is so much here that's delightful in so many ways , you begin to realize what movies are supposed to be , yet so rarely are : transporting experiences . i'm sure many filmmakers would love the absolute control over their movie universe -- every blink , every blade of grass -- that john lasseter has over his . i'm equally sure most of them wouldn't have a clue what to do with it . a computer , as the cliche goes , is just a tool . it takes a visionary like john lasseter to turn it into a magic wand . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1873,"the talented mr . director : anthony minghella . mpaa rating : r ( violence , brief nudity , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 135 minutes . for the life of me , i don't know why any film-maker would take on the thankless task of literary adaptation . if he is too scrupulously faithful ( see : angela's ashes ) , he risks creating a narrative without its own identity as a film . you don't want to infuriate fans of the source material ( paul verhoeven's starship troopers ) , and you don't want to sacrifice a unique artistic perspective just to get every detail right ( the green mile ) . it is , simultaneously , a can't-miss and a can't-win proposition . if anthony minghella feels that pressure , he sure doesn't show it . he squeezed and compacted the english patient's complex narrative , and came up with a beautiful old-fashioned romantic drama . ripley , he has completely re-made the story's titular morally-ambiguous protagonist . the result may give purists fits , but it's a strangely invigorating piece of psychological suspense . tom , however , finds dickie's life of expatriate revelry far too fascinating to be concerned with much besides ingratiating himself into it -- by any means necessary . minghella's ripley turns tom into something far more than an admittedly fascinating portrait of amorality . minghella combines this twisty characterization with direction that occasionally leans too heavily on visual metaphor . the cues can feel a bit heavy-handed , but minghella can also stage scenes where tension appears in unexpected ways -- a shouted confession unheard , a lingering moment caught in the space between two lies . it's one thing to direct actors well , which minghella certainly does here ( philip seymour hoffman is particularly fine as an icily condescending ugly american ) . it's rarer to find someone who can find all the right notes in character interaction , from the turn of a phrase to the placement of an uncomfortable silence . many viewers are likely to be put off by the talented mr . ripley's less-than-tidy conclusion , which serves as a bookend to the film's arresting opening shot . of course , that's just one of the many ways that anthony minghella risks losing his audience . his interpretation of the talented mr . ripley is undeniably a departure from highsmith , but it's a departure that works the way any thoughtful re-interpretation can work . the talented mr . minghella has fashioned a seductive , sad portrait of a man helplessly watching the loss of his own soul . it may be fitting that tom ripley , master chameleon , has taken on yet another new shape for this version of his story . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1874,"screenplay/director : jane campion . a couple of months ago , i finally saw jane campion's 1991 film an angel at my table . i mention this only because i experienced a very similar reaction to the piano as i did to that film . while i was not instantly caught up in the story , its impact grew slowly , and in fact it was not until a couple of days later that i realized what a powerful work i had experienced . the piano is a bit less consistent than an angel at my table , but it is nevertheless an astonishingly literate work , and a further step in the development of a major filmmaker . the piano is so rich and multi-layered that it virtually defies immediate reaction . at its heart is a story of socially repressed desires which calls to mind the age of innocence and the remains of the day , but this film strengthens that theme by thrusting its characters into an untamed setting . this conflict lends added texture to stewart's attempt to lock ada into their house , and the perplexed reaction of his housemaids . as intricate as the script is , it is the intensity of the lead performances which gives the piano most of its power . holly hunter has been trumpeted since cannes as an oscar front-runner , and it's easy to see why . it's impossible to describe how expressive she manages to be , in her face and with her body . the literally breath-taking effect of the piano's climactic scene is exponentially multiplied by hunter's slow , lingering reaction . baines' role is less fully explained , a bit too typological , but keitel shows a surprising gentleness . i may have been most impressed by sam neill , freed from the straitjacket of jurassic park to do some splendid acting . hunter's attempt at a scotch accent is shaky , and it detracts somehow from the experience to be allowed inside ada's head . otherwise , campion crafts a stunning film . stuart dryburgh's dynamic cinematography helps capture the power of coastline and forest , and campion's voyeuristic camera placement is thrilling . it's no longer sufficient or appropriate to refer to jane campion as one of the best woman director's working ; she is simply one of the best directors , and the piano is one of the most haunting films of the year .

1875,"screenplay : william nicholson . director : richard attenborough . if anthony hopkins and debra winger aren't careful , they're likely to knock themselves out of contention for academy award nominations by doing too much excellent work in one year . now the two talented actors are paired in richard attenborough's shadowlands , and the result is stunning . this moving , intelligent love story provides winger with her best role in a decade , and hopkins with a chance to add the second best male performance of 1993 to a resume which already includes the best . nicholson's play is a winner , and he has written a sparkling adaptation . the verbal sparring between lewis and joy is wonderful , the best this year not written by william shakespeare . it's the kind of love story hollywood just doesn't turn out all that often , a simple but affecting examination of the ability of love to transform , and to make life's pain bearable . lewis himself wrote about the experience in the philosophical work a grief observed , and that is the tone shadowlands adopts : introspective and restrained , yet still deeply felt . the score by john fenton is non-intrusive , and some of the film's most potent emotional moments are almost completely silent . it's an extremely deft piece of filmmaking by attenborough , a director best known for epics like gandhi but equally skilled at personal moments . and it doesn't hurt that his two leads give oscar-worthy performances . once again hopkins demonstrates the rare ability to act with his entire body , turning an aborted wave to a departing cab into a rich visual text . however , shadowlands would have come up short if joy had not been equally well-handled , and debra winger proves well up to the challenge . there is strength , intelligence , savage wit and deep emotion in her performance , and she somehow manages to steal scenes from one of the finest screen actors in the world . winger has been seen far too infrequently in recent years , but it would appear shadowlands is likely to correct that oversight . shadowlands was well on its way to being a "" 10 "" before it lost steam in the last half hour . still , shadowlands ranks among the best films of 1993 , artistic and profoundly emotional .

"" -- but it is . movies just don't get much more fundamentally satisfying on so many levels -- simple without being simplistic , grand in scope without losing track of its basic appeal . the story is , to put it bluntly , older than the roman empire : reluctant-but-impossibly-noble hero fights against great odds to bring low a regal-but-impossibly-dastardly villain . it has been done and done and done again , because when it's done well , few stories are as viscerally effective . and gladiator does it remarkably well . crowe plays maximus as straight as he can possibly be played , giving him an iconic grandeur ; it's the kind of role that makes actors into movie stars . the late oliver reed also scores in his final role as the casually cynical proximo . every one of them is playing a standard film type ; every one of them refuses to submit to the notion that a type can't be played with energy and commitment . as a basic film story , gladiator is lean and effective . and it's not too bad as a visual treat , either . copious use of digital effects is de rigeur for epic genre films circa 2000 , yet there is nothing remotely obligatory or pointlessly showy about gladiator's re-creation of ancient rome . it's stunning work that raises the ruins of the colosseum and captures both the magnificence and the casual brutality of the culture . it is becoming a hollywood clich to claim that "" every dollar is up there on the screen , "" but that's the way gladiator feels . the execution of its technical detail is so precise that it never feels like more or less than exactly what is necessary to complement the story . if there's a weak link to gladiator , it's the amount of time devoted to roman political intrigue . the imperial/republican squabbling and back-stabbing certainly recall classic sword-n-sandal films like spartacus , but gladiator starts to drag a bit whenever derek jacobi's plotting senator is on screen . perhaps it's just that gladiator is so invigorating as a stripped-down , nuts-and-bolts dramatic adventure that anything remotely resembling subtext just gets in the way . it's even more silly than amusing to contemplate parallels between gladiator's crowd-pleasing bloodsports and professional wrestling ( complete with maximus's combat moniker "" the spaniard "" ) . the usual caveat for summer event films has been something akin to "" leave your brain at the door , "" but that's not entirely appropriate or fair to apply to gladiator ; it's too smartly scripted in its old-fashioned way . the better suggestion is to leave your expectations of hipness , reflexivity and big-budget bombast at the door . gladiator is just entertaining . . . in all the wonderful ways that word can be a good thing . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1877,"screenplay : peter hedges . director : lasse hallstrom . tone alone cannot sustain a film , but it can go a long way . if i can find myself lost in the time and place of a story , it scores immediate style points . when that tone is backed up by an outstanding story and great acting , the effect can be described best by an adjective i do not use lightly : "" literary . "" what's eating gilbert grape ? is such a film . it's a rich , memorable and stunningly acted story of desire colliding with responsibility , staged in a manner which many viewers might find too prosaic , but which insinuated itself into my imagination with its confidence . the midwestern sunsets and sprawling fields are beautifully photographed , and the atmosphere of the town is intensely real . minor characters , like crispin glover as the town's mortician , are vividly realized , and there are echoes of the last picture show in mary steenburgen's desperately unhappy housewife . not a single note in the depiction of endora rang false . the same can be said of the character of gilbert . it's testimony to the precision involved in his creation that he came together completely with one perfectly placed line , when becky responds to gilbert's description of his father with , "" i knew someone like that once . "" johnny depp expertly demonstrates the tension central to gilbert by playing everything below the surface , but he never gives in to one-dimensional blankness or simply regurgitates his naif roles in benny & joon and edward scissorhands . depp's performance is overshadowed , however , by leonardo dicaprio's astonishing oscar-nominated supporting work as arnie . he puts to shame such big name actors as john malkovich and dustin hoffman , whose mentally challenged characters never seemed completely real . only juliette lewis doesn't quite click , playing a critical role with her now familiar dopey drone and too little genuine spark . gilbert grape does seem to drift into its conclusion , but it never lost me . thanks to a lovingly created setting and a marvelous cast , this 1993 release proves well worth the wait .

1878,"what i know about classical music , i could explain to you in ten minutes . i had never heard of glenn gould before i heard of this film . it is possible that with greater background knowledge , i might have appreciated thirty-two films about glenn gould more . . . although i can't imagine how . glenn gould is a thoroughly remarkable film experience , as confident as it is ambitious , as masterfully realized as it is skillfully constructed . it is difficult for me to conceive of a biography which more vividly conveys its subject , in all his complexity , and it is easy for me to state that it is the best film i have seen in 1994 . thirty-two short films about glenn gould is exactly what its title would suggest : a series of vignettes examining in various ways the life and music of glenn gould , the acclaimed and enigmatic canadian classical pianist who died in 1982 at the age of 50 . there are also abstract interpretations of gould's work as a performer and as a composer . while each of the thirty-two individually titled segments in glenn gould is self-contained , it is the manner in which they are connected which makes the film so compelling . despite the changes in perspective and varying film techniques , glenn gould never seems fragmented ; it maintains an unmistakable flow which is rarely anything but gripping . it helps that francois girard has chosen such a fascinating subject , but it is girard's brilliant direction which makes gould , the movie and the man , come alive . and while the dramatized sequences tend to present a man of almost other-worldly talent and insight , the inclusion of the interviews with real acquaintances of gould's gives him a fundamental humanity . there is the occasional misstep . a few of the sequences seem repetitive , particularly "" practice "" and "" passion according to gould , "" both of which show gould's rapture in response to his own music ; and "" the tip , "" while amusing , seems somewhat out of place . i was also less than enthralled by the lengthy animated segment "" gould meets mclaren , "" and "" variation in c minor , "" another fantasia-like visual representation of music . thirty-two short films about glenn gould introduced me to a fragile , uniquely humanistic genius i wanted to know more about , and in a way i doubt i'll ever forget .

1879,"screenplay : cameron crowe . director : cameron crowe . cameron crowe's almost famous -- the writer/director's first film since 1996's jerry maguire -- tallies up its first simple yet thoroughly inspired moment just seconds into the film , during the opening credits . in a cute conceit connected to the story's protagonist , a 15-year-old aspiring music journalist , we see a hand scrawling out the cast on a yellow pad with a pencil . not a line of dialogue had been spoken , and already i was hooked . to crib a line from crowe's last film , almost famous had me at hello . crowe has helmed only four films in his career -- say anything , singles , jerry maguire and now almost famous -- but i'm tempted to call him america's most effortlessly gifted film-maker . there's nothing particularly profound about a coming-of-age story with a rock 'n' roll backdrop , nor does there need to be . crowe isn't a "" statement "" kind of guy , and it doesn't seem to hurt his films in the least . almost famous simply drops us into the world of rock in the early '70s , and lets us observe through william's wide eyes . like crowe's other films , this one seems to amble along in no particular hurry to get anywhere , giving the characters lots of room to maneuver , yet never feels unfocused or uninvolving . occasionally the loose structure gets in the way , as it does when crowe fails to provide enough foundation for stillwater's burgeoning popularity either through their music or through their performances . far more often , the moment-to-moment experience is too enjoyable for anyone to notice . in large part , that moment-to-moment pleasure comes from crowe's uncanny ability to direct actors . as he has in his previous films , he puts together a solid cast and makes magic . mcdormand , though she remains a too-mannered performer at times , is still entertaining as william's intense mother ; fugit is likeable and innocent in a way that's never bland ; hoffman is yet again is so good you just want to throttle hollywood for not allowing him to be a star . like william , penny only fools herself into thinking it's ever about the music ; though she creates herself as a sort of muse , she's just looking to fill an empty space with rock 'n' roll's mythology of freedom . penny is the story's anchor , and hudson's facial expressions are so perfect they're heartbreaking . as deftly as crowe handles his story , there are still occasional missteps . those tics and a few others like it might have been more damaging in another film , made by another film-maker , but almost famous just seems to absorb its flaws and roll on . there's something almost hypnotic about the grace with which cameron crowe puts a film together , something that produces winner after winner . it's not a life-changing experience , not a clockwork plot or a joke-a-minute script . it's just the pleasure of watching a director who can suck you in with the brush of an eraser . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1880,"all right , that might be a slight exaggeration ; i have some ideas about that life after death thing . reeves remains a mystery , a physically striking but mush-mouthed thespian who has been cast by coppola , bertolucci and branagh . arriving with more buzz than a swarm of killer bees is speed , and you can believe the hype . thrilling and relentless to a fault , speed seems destined to score big box office and make reeves a very hot property . as high concepts go , speed would have been difficult to screw up completely . where i had my doubts was regarding the ability to keep things varied and interesting ; there are only so many ways a bus can crash through guardrails and other cars . but astonishingly , speed continues to come up with new and interesting predicaments just when you think there can't be anywhere else for it to go . screenwriter graham yost and director jan debont almost give themselves too tough an act to follow by opening with the elevator rescue , a stunningly staged sequence that will leave you breathless before you're even out of popcorn . once the action hits the road , the set pieces come fast , furious and rarely derivative . there is even that rarity of rarities , a moment that inspires a collective audible gasp , followed closely by relieved laughter . the term "" edge of your seat "" is thrown around a lot , but that is exactly where i spent the majority of speed's two hour running time . he is asked to do little more than set his jaw and look good in a tight t-shirt , and he's good at both . the taciturn traven is a switch from the willis/ schwarzenegger school of one-liner heroism , and something of a welcome one at that . with reeves maintaining a poker face , the required tension release falls to the supporting cast . sandra bullock , so annoying as stallone's partner in demolition man , is extremely appealing as driver/passenger annie , managing to combine strength and emotion in a surprisingly seamless performance . the performances are better than one might expect from a film like speed , and from keanu reeves in particular . if there is a fault to be found with speed , it's that it really doesn't know when enough is enough . the bus's physics defying leap over a stretch of incomplete freeway is more comically absurd than exciting , and almost lost me . once the bus-based plot is over , there's still another fifteen minutes to go , and perhaps out of some sense of houw an action film has to end there is a mano-a-mano between reeves and hopper aboard a commuter train . at that point , yet another set of improbable crises becomes overkill . and ironically , it may have eliminated one possible plot for the sequel . don't be surprised if there is one ; speed is 1994's the fugitive , and then some . summer's first thrill ride is here .

1883,"screenplay : david gordon green . director : david gordon green . mpaa rating : unrated ( could be pg-13 for violence , adult themes ) running time : 89 minutes . in david gordon green's haunting feature debut george washington , there is no real story to speak of . actually , it's not accurate to say there's no story in george washington . it's more accurate to say there's no plot , because its story is one of the year's most compelling , even when it occasionally lapses into heavy-handedness . it has become something of a national pastime trying to figure out what's wrong with american teens in the era of columbine , and plenty of films from river's edge to kids and onward have tried to capture the aimlessness , amorality and anarchy of contemporary adolescence . i don't think any one of them has captured the soul of america's confused youth as effectively -- or with as much compassion -- as george washington . if such subject matter sounds like it could turn into pretentious filmmaking , fear not . though green's early slow-motion shots may raise fears that he's trying to make a big statement , he ultimately depends on small statements . his cast of young non-professional actors , often improvising around general story points , finds the truth of these characters in dialogue so casual that its profundity comes as an aftershock . even nasia's occasionally florid voice-over narration feels just right , the attempts of a little girl to convey her worldliness . in its rambling , no-particular-place-to-go rhythm , it's hypnotic viewing . it's also the most beautifully photographed film you're likely to see this year . virtually every scene seems to have been shot in some otherworldly twilight , so golden that they almost hurt the eyes . the rare scenes shot indoors capture the grimness of the characters' domestic lives , and one dark public restroom becomes the film's unique vision of hell . when you're not busy wondering at the naturalistic splendor of the performances , you'll be busy wondering at the carefully constructed splendor of the visuals . george washington's final half hour takes a turn toward other thematic elements , as george attempts to re-define himself after a tragic development . the transition isn't particularly smooth , but green doesn't appear particularly concerned with making his film a smooth experience . indeed , some of his editing and dialogue choices are so off-beat ( like the complete absence of profanity from its teenage characters ) you can't help but just let him carry you wherever he leads . where he's leading is a place hinted at in the film's title , a place where children are forced to look backward for their heroes because there aren't any in their own lives . yes , indeed , george washington does tell a story . if only more films with plots could tell stories like this . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1884,"producers : edward zwick , marshall herskovitz and laura bickford . director : steven soderbergh . in most films about drugs or drug addicts , drugs themselves are an almost supernatural presence . even the very good ones tend to turn addiction into a monster , something that stalks and consumes the people in the film -- a thc-laced blob , or a needle from the black lagoon . they may play with moral ambiguity , but ultimately they come down to a horror film mano a mano : either the monkey kills the hero , or the hero kills the monkey . in steven soderbergh's elusively gripping traffic , drugs are not a monster ; they're not even the villain . drugs become a character , crafted with more complexity and nuance than the human characters in most films . based on a bbc mini-series , traffic sets up an ambitious scope that proves absolutely critical to its effectiveness . every character in the film is in some way complicit in making the drug trade the violent beast it is , from the blatantly unconcerned mexican officials , to the wealthy white teenagers whose pretentious expressions of existential despair ignore the real-world implications of their drug use . steven gaghan's script never once offers either a pat condemnation of anti-drug efforts or a simplistic demonization of the substances themselves . it's a rich , deeply thought-provoking piece of work . it's not half-bad as pure film-making either . soderbergh has become a master of incorporating stylistic innovation into relatively mainstream fare , and he scores again here . the scenes set in mexico are given a grainy , saturated look that make the whole country look like it's suffering from a case of heat-stroke ; there's a sharp , sudden contrast with an early courtroom scene shot in an icy blue . traffic often has an almost improvisational edge to it , and virtually every scene and performance feels kinetic and urgent . this is a film full of scenes that grab you without a hint of melodrama , full of background characters ( peter riegert as ayala's smug attorney , "" that '70s show's "" topher grace as caroline's cocky boyfriend ) that burst to vibrant life . and that's saying nothing of at least one foreground character ( benicio del toro's conflicted cop ) so splendidly performed that his scenes seem like part of a documentary . traffic only hits speed bumps when the sheer density of the narrative becomes a hindrance . the script occasionally resorts to making speeches to make its points -- with ferrer's mid-level dealer in particular uttering "" you can't stop us "" taunts to law enforcement -- as though afraid the points already made by the arc of the story would be lost in the shuffle . some of the key characters feel vaguely under-developed , and there are a couple of late scenes and plot developments that feel forced into an already dense tale , giving traffic the sense of being over-loaded during its third act . it's still an awfully good third act , one that wraps up an even better movie with the perfect combination of harsh reality and genuinely satisfying optimism . i'm not sure you could say traffic ever takes a side on its difficult subject , unless it's the side that small , personal victories can still make a losing battle worth fighting . that's a refreshingly mature take on a subject that usually comes down to killing monsters . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1885,"screenplay/director : david o . russell . spanking the monkey is as difficult to watch as any film this year . let me clarify that--that is not because it is terrible . on the contrary , spanking the monkey is one of the best films of 1994 to date . but it is not a pleasant experience . it's a blacker- than-pitch comedy about a particularly dysfunctional family , one in which we are witnesses to the implosion of the main character's psyche . what makes it impossible to look away is a pair of stunning lead performances in a story as horifically comic as anything concocted by david lynch . it's not an easy task . mrs . aibelli is demanding and depressive , and takes more than a passing interest in raymond's sex life . it is only because watson allows us to see mrs . aibelli's deep pain that actions which instinctively cause the audience to cringe also seem to make a kind of twisted sense . jeremy davies' performance as raymond is more restrained , but just as poignant . there is a lack of back story written in to russell's script , but davies fills in all the blanks with a reading that tells us that while what we see are extremes , this kind of dysfunction is nothing new to this family . davies carries himself in a state of perpetual tension , a tension which is denied simpler release at every opportunity , and finally boils over with results that prompt very nervous laughter . davies and watson deliver two of the best performances of the year , and give the unpleasant subject matter a surprising appeal . it does at times seem that russell has expended all his energy on the complexities of raymond and his mother . however there are so many piercingly insightful moments that these sketchy characters are easier to tolerate . one extremely effective scene shows raymond hanging out with some old high school acquaintances , guys he clearly didn't like then and likes even less now . it's a scene comic in its painful familiarity , and one more of the many things russell does right to highlight how trapped raymond feels . spanking the monkey deals with difficult subjects in a brutally honest manner , and will have an inherently limited audience , but it so daring and well-acted that it is worth risking the unpleasant taste it may leave in your mouth .

1886,"screenplay/director : quentin tarantino . according to all evidence , pulp fiction is going to be one of those movies that turns people into incarnations of beavis and butthead ; either it "" sucks "" or it "" kicks ass , "" apparently with no tenable middle ground . this of course is the natural course of things for films as unique as pulp fiction . quentin tarantino's stunning sophomore effort deserves better . it is the kind of film , imperfect though it may be , which should inspire discussion about how exciting the medium can be . there are more moments in this one film which awed me to silence than in every other 1994 release combined , and while its faults may not allow it to stand as the year's best film , it's certainly close . pulp fiction is divided into segments telling interlocking tales about a group of shady characters . this is what must be said about pulp fiction : few films in the last fifteen years have left me so charged with the pure gonzo thrill of movie-making . has there been a more erotically charged conversation than that between vincent and mia at a gaudy 50's-style burger joint ? has the flushing of a toilet ever caused such a combination of laughter and suspense . and has any scene caused an entire audience to squirm quite so violently as a spectacular moment involving an overdose victim and a six inch hypodermic needle ? quentin tarantino refuses to let any moment just sit there ; relationships between characters crackle with intensity , and darkly comic punch lines are spit out like bullets . i left pulp fiction feeling as though i had not simply watched a movie , but * experienced * one . i was exhausted . however , it would be a mistake to suggest that there is nothing to pulp fiction but its visceral impact . tarantino does not place his characters in a universe of amoral anarchy ; as reservoir dogs first indicated , he is fascinated with loyalty and moments of improbable selflessness . two such moments provide the moral backbone of pulp fiction . both are showcases for career performances . willis is better than his previous work had ever so much as hinted at , while jackson delivers what is quite simply the best performance in an american film this year . it is at these moments when pulp fiction , for all its frantic energy , reveals its real message : even in a world this violent , salvation is possible . the only real problem with pulp fiction is a significant lag between the marvelous middle segment and jackson's tour-de-force monologue . but tarantino brackets that lull with such sheer cinematic glory , that the sour taste doesn't linger . pulp fiction is violent , profane and filled with addicts , racists and killers . at the same time , it may be one of the most moral stories the big screen has seen in years . that tarantino was able to pull off that little maneuver says as much about his talent as a dozen palmes d'or .

1887,"screenplay : george welsh and peter jackson . director : peter jackson . earlier this year , i commented on thematically similar films where the later release suffered in comparison to the first . wyatt earp languished in the wake of the less reverent but far more entertaining tombstone ; blown away was blown away by the gleefully brainless speed . it was not a great film , but good enough that i wondered if my evaluation of heavenly creatures might be influenced . but where fun was occasionally stagy and ponderous , heavenly creatures is dazzling , a perversely original psychodrama . the strongest elements in fun were the performances of the two young lead actresses , and ironically the same elements provide the only minor weak link in heavenly creatures . melanie lynskey is the better of the two , playing the more complicated character , but it seems she settles into expressing every emotion by glowering beneath her nest of unruly dark curls ; kate winslet is occasionally a bit much , arching her eyebrows and punching her oh-so-proper upper crust diction . however , their scenes together are quite effective , and they show a natural rapport . lynskey in particular comes alive beautifully , and the intensity of their relationship never seems implausible . it is also illustrated with astonishing creativity by peter jackson , best known for the marvelously demented dead alive . from the first frames , jackson slams us into a world of chaos and delusion , and even through light-hearted scenes there is a sense of foreboding as we await the inevitable conclusion . this is the real triumph of heavenly creatures : although it is alternately a drama , a fantasy and a mystery , it is an absolutely coherent whole . because we know where this relationship will lead , there is an undercurrent of menace in dark-humored sequences where pauline visualizes revenge fantasies . it also presents the disturbing premise that given the right ( or wrong ) circumstances , the fantasy world every adolescent creates could explode into the real world . those circumstances involve a delicate issue , one also raised by fun . since there is a sexual element to the relationship between pauline and juliet , it would be possible to misinterpret the film as suggesting that their crime , leopold and loeb-like , was just another manifestation of their "" deviance . "" but jackson is up to something more subtle than that . through both his audacious direction and an insightful script , peter jackson has crafted a powerful character study that is unlike anything you'll see this year .

1888,"screenplay : robin swicord . director : gillian armstrong . it would be a tremendous disservice to think of little women as a picture post card with a plot . sure , it is lovingly photographed , rich in atmosphere and steeped in period detail . but does louisa may alcott's saga of 19th century adolescence have anything to say in 1994 ? is it really * about * anything ? the answer is a resounding yes . as brought to life by a magnificent cast and directed with restraint by gillian armstrong , little women is sweet , glorious and relevant . director armstrong , who addressed the subject of women struggling in a man's world in my brilliant career , has done a splendid job with this latest version of the oft-filmed story . she never attempts to inject inappropriate action into the narrative , and keeps her actors quiet and naturalistic . she is also assisted by a wonderful technical crew . cinematographer geoffrey simpson captures snow-covered landscapes and glowing fall colors with grace , and production designer jan roelfs fills the screen with lovely interiors . the crowning touch is thomas newman's beautiful score , which perfectly complements the beautiful images armstrong provides . the primary reason the screen glows , however , is a remarkable cast which features the most talented young actresses in the business . jo is the showcase role , and winona ryder gives her most complete performance yet in taking it on ; she is full of ambition , joy , and self-doubt . physically , she's quite wrong for the part ( it's hard to believe anyone would consider ryder's hair her "" one beauty , "" even without makeup ) , but she's so impressive emotionally that her looks can be forgiven . claire danes , from tv's critically-praised by largely unwatched "" my so-called life , "" may be the best of the bunch . beth's role is small , but danes injects phenomenal emotion into every one of her scenes , and her large , sad eyes guarantee that many eyes in the audience will be damp at certain moments . what may be most impressive about this little women , adapted by robin swicord , is how it seems as though it might have been written yesterday . there is no anachronism in alcott's transcendentalist proto-feminism , though upon first glance it might appear so . i saw little women in a theater where perhaps one third of the audience consisted of girls under sixteen . little women may be a story to which they are most attuned , but it is a delight for anyone who appreciates genuine emotion , insight , and beautiful filmmaking .

1889,"screenplay : alan bennett . director : nicholas hytner . how do you market a stage-originated historical drama to an american viewing public which forced a change in the film's title when they struggled with the concept that the madness of king george iii was not a sequel ? you could tell them that , like medicine or "" masterpiece theater , "" it was good for them , an approach which rarely works . or you could try this truth : the madness of king george is thoughtful , funny , spectacularly staged and richly performed . nigel hawthorne's complex performance as george iii brings the humanity to the role necessary to raise alan bennett's story of monarchy in decline to a work of rare insight . perhaps more than anything else , the madness of king george is about the dissolution of monarchy . finally , as willis straps him to a chair , his statement that "" i am the king "" is greeted by a simple "" no . . . you are the patient . "" if it appears from this description that alan bennett , who adapted his own stage play for the screen , is baldly anti-royalty , that isn't entirely the case . he makes george a remarkably sympathetic character , and casts an even darker eye on the machinations of those whose only concerns about his well-being are political . he is by turns comic , petulant , tender and infuriating , crafting a performance so vivid that it is easy to forget that he is playing a king . the most pleasant surprise in the madness of king george may be that stage director nicholas hytner , in his first screen directing effort , demonstrates such an instinctive understanding of what makes the two media different . he opens up the play , taking advantage of ken adam's superb production design , and he uses close-ups to marvelous effect . in fact , the only things wrong with the film might be a few lackluster supporting performances and references which require a bit too much knowledge of british political history ( notably a pun on "" pitt the elder and pitt the younger "" ) .

1890,"starring : mick lally , eileen colgan , jeni courtney , richard sheridan , john lynch . screenplay/director : john sayles . that john sayles continues to make films is something of a testimony to his dedication , and that his films continue to be released is a testimony to an audience somewhere out there with taste and intelligence . sayles has been relentlessly his own animal as a writer-director , making movies like the brother from another planet , matewan and passion fish which have been marketing nightmares because they were unique tales that a single tag line couldn't capture . as those examples also show , sayles doesn't help his cause any with catchy titles . the secret of roan inish is another of sayles' unconventional efforts , and yet another work of art , a beautifully filmed tale of myth , magic and the power of oral history . gifted cinematographer haskell wexler captures stunning land- and seascapes with clarity even through layers of mist , and his interiors are close but inviting . mason daring's arrangements of traditional folk melodies provide the perfect complement to wexler's images , full of soaring tin whistle and plaintive violin . most effective is sayles' unsentimental directing style , which presents roan inish's more mythical elements so matter-of-factly that they take on even more of an aura of wonder . the ireland of the secret of roan inish is full of magic , and sayles presents magic as an understood part of the tapestry of irish life . what keeps the magic alive , however , is the oral tradition , and this is what sayles is truly celebrating in the secret of roan inish . even though we are also seeing the events described , it is the words which are truly memorable , spoken with passion and conviction , a direct link through time between individuals and their history . at a time when tradition is a somewhat unfashionable concept , sayles has crafted a love poem to tradition . there is probably not a single name or face in the cast of roan inish which is familiar to american audiences , but the performances are mostly charming and understated . newcomers jeni courtney ( fiona ) and richard sheridan ( fiona's cousin and co-conspirator eamon ) have their weak moments , but are basically solid . the secret of roan inish is lyrical , low-key and evocative , which could translate to "" slow and boring "" for some audiences . those with a taste for something crafted with grace , confidence and a feel for the power of a well-told tale will find this one secret worth sharing .

1891,"screenplay : malcolm bradbury . director : john schlesinger . cold comfort farm is directed with such sparkle and confidence that i almost couldn't believe john schlesinger was behind the camera . . . at least not the john schlesinger whose recent contributions to the cinematic canon were suspense misfires like pacific heights , the innocent and eye for an eye . even in his glory days of midnight cowboy , the day of the locust and marathon man , one would hardly say that "" light-hearted "" was an adjective applicable to his work . yet here we find schlesinger tackling the much-beloved stella gibbons novel , a parody with a giddy and irreverent tone , and nailing it . cold comfort farm is thoroughly entertaining and consistently surprising . a literary satire is a real challenge to film -- it's like trying to pull the humor out of that annual contest to duplicate hemingway's prose style and put it on screen -- but screenwriter malcolm bradbury has come up with the clever premise of following flora's budding writing career . grasping at the perfect metaphor for a sunset ( she can never quite figure out what "" the golden orb "" is supposed to do ) over her open d . h . lawrence novels , flora allows us a bit of insight into the florid writing gibbons was winking at . but cold comfort farm is even more successful at turning the conventions of those genres' plots upside down . those secrets turn out to be red herrings ; it doesn't matter _what_ they are , only that everyone at cold comfort farm is living under the weight of those long-past events , waiting for someone like flora to come along and push each of them in the direction of the one thing that will make them genuinely excited . the result is some hilarious moments and sharp performances , as we watch amos improvising a sermon before his church of ( literally ) quivering brethren , and seth grabbing his chance at big-screen stardom , and the characters are rendered with a refreshing lack of concern over whether they are being condescended to . that is a criticism some detractors have leveled against cold comfort farm , and i think they are missing the point . but schlesinger and bradbury show gibbons' characters with an eye to the basic desire for happiness which flora is trying to uncover . flora brings a breath of life to cold comfort farm , and schlesinger's cold comfort farm brings a breath of life to a decidedly musty film season .

1892,"screenplay : todd solondz . director : todd solondz . actually , she may be more typical , which is to say more miserable . well , welcome to the dollhouse , todd solondz's brutally funny portrait of the nightmare that is adolescence . it should be made perfectly clear that welcome to the dollhouse is not , in that favored film terminology , a "" coming-of-age "" story . no one becomes an adult at 11 , and while solondz features such rites of passage as dawn's first big crush and first kiss , she learns no great truths about life . no , welcome to the dollhouse is about a much more basic truth -- that there is no more unpleasant time in a human life than the middle school years . welcome to the dollhouse is an episodic story which follows dawn through several weeks of her seventh-grade year , and some of those episodes are so perfectly handled that they are painful to watch . it is surprising that solondz has captured the world of a young girl with such detail , but he is dealing with a time where the horrors of unpopularity are very similar between the genders , and where knowledge about sex is still too abstract to make the psychology of adolescence completely different . the fact that she _is_ a girl simply allowed heather matarazzo to nail the part with a startling willingness to look completely homely , and to be less than heroic . the magic of matarazzo's performance is that we feel for her not because she is better than those who torment her , but because her fate is so familiar . when solondz does stumble , it is because he tries to move beyond the simple truths of dawn's life to big-picture issues , or to give his story an artificial sense of resolution . the old saying that comedy is simply tragedy plus time is most certainly true when it comes to adolescence , and welcome to the dollhouse is a winning portrait of the only story that matters when you are eleven years old and different : getting out alive .

1893,"directors : kirk wise and gary trousdale . as i sat in my car twenty minutes after the conclusion of the hunchback of notre dame , tears still welling up in my eyes , i though about what made me respond to disney's recent animated hits , even flawed efforts like pocahontas . it was not simply animation to which i was responding , since animated films like balto had left me unmoved , and i like to believe that disney's ubiquitous marketing had no influence . i thought about the moments in films like beauty and the beast and the little mermaid which had filled me with the pure joy of film artistry , and i realized the connection : music . the hunchback of notre dame is dark , enchanting , visually spectacular and richer in thematic depth than 99% of the live action films i see , but i know that it was the power of grand opera which pushed me over the edge . there is no question that computer technology is allowing disney animators an ever-increasing freedom , and the opportunity to create some astonishing images . there are scenes involving thousands of "" extras "" which are simply extraordinary , and a swooping shot as quasimodo comes to esmeralda's rescue which is breath-taking . still , the conventional character animation might be even better . it seems almost unfair to single out one star , but i will : kathy zielinski , the character supervisor for frollo . she has designed one of disney's most complicated villains ever , a tormented and hateful zealot with a mouth so cruel and subtly expressive that he makes you want to shudder every time he smiles . with superb voice work by tony jay , frollo becomes a brilliant characterization . if an animator ever deserved credit for a best supporting actor performance , this might be the case . frollo's tortured soul ( revealed in a creepy and very un-disney-like song called "" hellfire "" ) is just one of many rather adult subjects which gives hunchback a surprising resonance . quasimodo's cowering respect for frollo is heart-breaking , rendered poignantly by tom hulce . there is certainly a fair amount of comic relief , mostly provided by the gargoyles and the lively number "" a guy like you , "" but if hunchback is at all a film for children , it is one which exposes them to issues their parents should be prepared to discuss . the messages in hunchback are powerful , and they are skillfully handled , but there is something that happens when they are set to music . the songs by alan menken and steven schwartz are not particularly memorable by disney standards , nothing you will be humming for days afterwards like "" be our guest "" or "" under the sea , "" but they are evocative . a heartfelt sentiment which is sung rather than spoken draws its emotion from a different place . hollywood seems to believe that no one wants to see a musical in 1996 , and that disney's films are aberrations because they are animated . i'm not convinced that the real issue isn't choice of material . disney selects timeless tales , and a timeless tale in song is a powerful thing . there are certainly more than a few similarities between the hunchback of notre dame and beauty and the beast ( also directed by kirk wise and gary trousdale ) ; if it had been live action , i'd have sworn that they re-used some of the same sets in the opening number . beauty and the beast is a better film , a classic , and yet there i was , twenty minutes after the conclusion of hunchback , tears still welling up in my eyes , emotionally invested in the life of an animated character . and though the songs may not have been on my lips , i know they were in my heart .

1894,"nihilism does not equal art . i want to get that point out of the way , because it appears to be a widely-held belief that critics feel exactly the opposite . people note the praise lavished upon films like natural born killers , kids and seven and conclude that there is some conspiracy among the film cognoscenti to force bleakness down the collective throat of the viewing public . while i can speak for no critic but myself ( i admired seven , but not nbk or kids ) , i believe that the common thread is actually daring . film-makers dealing with unpleasant subject matter are almost forced to be inventive to keep the audience watching . others , if they choose , may praise trainspotting for its squalor ; i prefer to praise it for the invigorating perspectives of a writer and a director with ideas and the ability to convey them . no one is clean ; it's all a question of degree . but if there is one thing boyle does masterfully , it is showing exactly how brutal this particular degree can be . the users' relationship with the drug might be romanticized -- including a scene in which renton feels himself sinking into the floor -- there is nothing romanticized about the effects of heroin addiction . in some of these scenes there is a comic edge , but boyle counters them with some absolutely chilling moments , including a tragedy for which the only response anyone can think of is to get high again , and a nightmarish detox hallucination by renton which is guaranteed to have you squirming . with a virtuoso's skill , boyle is able to take viewers deeply enough into the experience of heroin users that they can see both the horrible toll the drug takes and the sensation which makes it all worthwhile to them . trainspotting's third act , focusing on a heroin deal which interferes in renton's attempt to live a straight life , is something of an unfortunate side trip , as the film loses much of the urgency it had done such an exceptional job of building . it does give robert carlyle's hair-trigger psychotic begbie a showcase , but the whole episode feels like padding in a much edgier film . it also provides a perfect comic coda for renton's stab at respectability , because it's clear he doesn't have the moral fiber for it . that actually shows what a neat trick boyle has pulled off : he has made a moral film without moralizing , even though it might not look like one on the surface . bleak may not always be beautiful , but in trainspotting it is necessary to make the point , a point as sharp as a needle in the arm .

1895,"ron shelton appears to understand two things better than any other contemporary film-maker : sports , and kevin costner . put a sports movie in the hands of almost any other director , and you get the feeling that they're just biding their time until the big climactic game/fight/match ; put kevin costner in the hands of almost any other director , and you find the thin-voiced actor placed in the uncomfortable position of playing commanding and heroic . when the two men joined forced previously , for 1988's bull durham , the result was one of the best and funniest sports films ever , and probably costner's best performance ever . that casually charming costner is re-born in tin cup , yet another superior shelton sports film overflowing with pleasures . there are a lot of kevin costner bashers out there -- i have been known to be one of them -- who have forgotten that he became a star in films like bull durham and field of dreams which allowed him to be warm , funny and approachable . that is too bad , but it happened because costner himself and plenty of other directors forgot , too . tin cup is a reminder of costner at his best , boyishly handsome and with an equally boyish temperament , and he has so much effortless fun playing roy that it is nearly impossible not to have fun with him . he is like a little league player who never out-grew little league , always swinging for the fences and always eager to please . costner manages to make immaturity incredibly endearing . shelton has given costner a great character to work with , and has fashioned a great story around that character . bull durham was so authentic in its detail about minor league baseball that it was easy to overlook the fact that shelton made a film that wasn't just about baseball . it was about playing a game because you loved it so much you couldn't imagine doing anything else , and the frustration of seeing a player with less love ( tim robbins' nuke laloosh ) have so much more talent . roy's problem is that he understands all too well that fans don't watch professional sports to see the steady hitter , the guy who runs the precise receiving route , or the guy who can make all his free throws ; they watch to see the home run hitter , the flashy runner , or the 360 degree dunk . that is what makes a ron shelton sports movie better than anyone else's sports movies : he has a better understanding of the way fans and players think . he also knows how to create scenes which sing with unexpected wit . shelton also gives his actors subtly eccentric characters to play , with tremendous results . only the leisurely , golf-like pace of tin cup proves troubling -- at 135 minutes , it has a few too many dead spots , and a rather unnecessary tangent involving roy's stripper ex-girlfriend . but by the time tin cup ends , those moments will have been forgotten . you'll be thinking about how smartly and cleverly ron shelton can write a sports film , how good kevin costner can be in them , and how many sports might be left on which they can collaborate .

1896,"if the ancient greeks hadn't already defined drama as character in action , mike leigh would have had to do it . leigh , along with ken loach , eric rohmer and john sayles , is in that exclusive company of film-makers who understand that an effective story is not simply what happens to the people on the screen -- it _is_ the people on the screen . a mike leigh film is the ultimate in low concept , the actors burying themselves so deeply in their characters that they are able to tear out their hearts and lay them bare . secrets & lies is about human beings , and that is what makes it a rarity ; what makes it great is how compelling the interaction between those human beings turns out to be . there are so many brilliantly shaded characterizations in secrets & lies that the oscars could find contenders in every major category if the voters were inclined to notice . with so many superb characterizations in secrets & lies , it is all the more extraordinary that brenda blethyn's work leaps out at you . cynthia purley is a woman whose entire life has been a desperate search for someone to show her affection , a search which has resulted mostly in pain , and blethyn makes her one of the most heartbreaking characters i have ever seen committed to film . the scene in which cynthia and hortense meet for the first time is staged by leigh in one mesmerizing seven minute take , with blethyn taking us through a dizzying array of emotions : regret , fear , anxiety , embarrassment , pride , relief . it is an utterly remarkable piece of acting . as fascinating as all these individuals are , however , it is the way in which they are joined to tell a story of a family in crisis which elevates secrets & lies . leigh is so skillful for so long that it is a genuine shame that the final fifteen minutes are devoted largely to an over-wrought airing of emotional dirty laundry , with tears , speeches and accusations flying across the living room . he didn't need manufactured drama of that sort , because the characters in secrets & lies live lives of everyday drama . they , and mike leigh's film , are beautiful simply because they are human .

1897,"screenplay : anthony minghella . director : anthony minghella . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , sexual situations , profanity , violence ) running time : 160 minutes . michael ondaatje's booker prize-winning novel _the english patient_ looked to be a remarkably difficult work to translate to the screen . a tale of intertwined lives which weaves its way through several time periods with a lyrical , dream-like prose style , it is the kind of narrative which could turn into a catastrophic failure as much in the hands of a too-reverential film-maker as a completely oblivious one . though miles removed from ondaatje's psychological drama , minghella's the english patient stands on its own as a powerful sweeping romance . . wonderful ) , but the english patient is a romance with the kind of sweep you associate with films made , and not merely set , in the 1940s . ralph fiennes turns in a wonderfully economical performance as almasy , a reserved man who begins with the minimalist philosophy that "" a thing is a thing "" but becomes utterly intoxicated by the first real passion in his life . kristin scott thomas matches his work with a radiant sensuality , turning the smart , perceptive katherine a deserving object of any man's fixation . thomas and fiennes share the kind of beautiful but intense chemistry movies seem reluctant to show us in 1996 , perhaps afraid that a cynical modern audience will not be able to take such deeply felt emotions seriously . it is not every writer who would risk dialogue like "" every night i cut out my heart , but in the morning it was full again ; "" it is not every director who would stage the defining moment in a relationship -- a scene in which almasy and katherine share a dance to , appropriately enough , "" where or when "" -- with virtually no dialogue , the attraction conveyed through a soul-piercing gaze by fiennes . minghella tries to link the two love stories in his film , but that may be the one place he is less than successful -- he has focused his story so decidedly on almasy and katherine that the peripheral characters are sometimes more distracting than complementary . it is to minghella's credit , however , that he has clarified a number of points in his streamlined narrative , creating a uniquely powerful story , less intricate and internalized than ondaatje's novel but just as involving . the quality which may make the english patient so singularly effective is its refusal to fit into neatly-defined categories of romantic film-making . it is emotional , yet it is suspenseful and full of action ; it is intensely personal , yet played against a historical and geographical backdrop filmed with bronzed grandeur by john seale ; it has moments of utter seriousness , then subverts a tender moment with an throwaway bit of comedy where katherine bangs her head on a girder . as risky as it might be to throw around comparisons with classics , the english patient is the kind of combination of humor , detailed characterization , passion and politics which recalls casablanca . almasy and katherine may share an on-screen consummation which cinema could not attempt 50 years ago , but in most other ways the central love story of the english patient warrants consideration among the great tragic pairings . minghella's risky adaptation has paid off gloriously , proving they _can_ make 'em like they used to .

1898,"kristin scott thomas's narration occupies only about ninety seconds of the dazzling documentary microcosmos , which made it even easier to hear every comment in an audience composed largely of families with young children . ordinarily , the prospect of an afternoon spent with a crowd of garrulous youngsters might send me screaming for an iv drip of valium , but the 75 minutes i spent in microcosmos may have been the most uplifting 75 minutes i've spent in a theater in years . here were 9- and 10-year-olds asking questions about insects , enraptured by the natural world , chattering excitedly in the lobby afterwards about their favorite scenes . it was one of those rare occasions when a film left me a bit more optimistic about our collective future as inquisitive beings . it is a simple enough concept ( though the process was anything but simple ) , but what makes microcosmos so consistently enthralling is the ability of nuridsany and perennou to find stories in their tiny subjects , stories which give them a personality . mating is not shown in clinical detail with a dry narrative description -- instead , two snails meet , caress and embrace in a strangely beautiful moment set to a soaring aria . in perhaps the film's most memorable sequence , a sacred scarab beetle rolls a small ball of dung until he is halted by a briar jutting out of the ground . the ability of that sequence to turn a beetle into a hero demonstrates that nuridsany and perennou have a talent most feature film-makers only dream about . most of us have seen nature footage of birds or amphibians which made the insects the insects upon which they snacked insignificant bit players in the food chain . microcosmos is like a novel based on another novel's supporting characters , turning sub-plots into life stories . one exceptional shot captures the bird's eye through the entrance to the ants' tunnels like an ogre peeping through a keyhole at his prey ; another represents the bird as a monstrous shadow . the film-makers want to show you parts of our world you may have taken for granted , and to show you in a way which grabs you as a narrative as much as an entomology lesson . in fact , the only time microcosmos sags is when it does resemble conventional nature footage . it is interesting watching a spider speed-wrap a grasshopper caught in its web , but it is a purely intellectual interest ; the same is true of a spider which constructs a kind of underwater diving bell for itself . these are moments which might make you go "" hmmm , "" but they don't fascinate you like a battle between stag beetles which seems to personalize the combatants . yet one of the best moments in the stag beetle sequence is a seemingly throwaway scene of another , smaller insect being tossed to the ground during the titanic struggle like a nameless patron in a western bar room brawl . it seems that even within this world there are supporting characters , and the wonderful thing about microcosmos is that you find yourself waiting for nuridsany and perennou to follow the unfortunate fellow on his own adventure , to the delight of children and adults alike .

1899,"screenplay : cameron crowe . director : cameron crowe . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , brief nudity , sexual situations ) running time : 135 minutes . there is an absolute poetry to the casting of tom cruise as jerry maguire which i do not think could have been matched by the casting of any other actor . then jerry describes his personal dilemma in voice-over , including a simple phrase -- "" i was 35 years old "" -- which is like a temporal slap in the face to anyone who finds it hard to reconcile cruise's image with the fact that "" the kid "" isn't a kid any more . what is most impressive about cameron crowe's script is not just that it is so rich and funny , but that it keeps so many balls in the air without once feeling crowded or directionless . every other bit of character interaction soars because the characters are so carefully drawn . they also are acted with uniform excellence , beginning with renee zellweger as the wistful dorothy , who treats jerry like an icon of a better life . the arc of her feelings for him -- from exhilaration to painful realism -- is rendered beautifully by zellweger , and the emotion she can express with her face is sometimes enough to make you want to burst into tears . he has a moment during an end zone dance which by all rights should be ridiculous ; instead , gooding makes it a glorious celebration . there is also the under-stated perfection of bonnie hunt's supporting work , and jay mohr in a marvelously despicable turn has jerry's conscience-impaired protege . however , the most memorable cast member may be young jonathan lipnicki , who virtually re-defines scene-stealing . with his spiky hair , round glasses and a smile which rivals that of his celebrated co-star , lipnicki brings a goofy energy to the screen , yet there is never a moment when he seems aware of his own adorableness . he is simply hilarious , and the affection between him and cruise makes for some priceless moments . jerry maguire is a film which doesn't appear to end far from where it started , because jerry is still a sports agent and still trying to make a good deal . in fact , jerry maguire is not just about one man's journey -- dorothy and rod also make subtle changes in their attitudes which help them discover what is really of value to them . jerry maguire is a simple but thoroughly uplifting story which is as funny as it is touching , and it finds tom cruise no longer cruising on that famous smile . . . although he may have cause to smile at his own efforts to do what he does in life a bit better . "
1900,"the release of george lucas' seminal blockbuster 20 years ago was the kind of happening which affected a generation of movie-goers , and i include myself in that generation . i was 10 years old in 1977 , and when you were 10 years old in 1977 you were not judged by whether you had seen star wars ; you were judged by how many _times_ you had seen star wars . it awed us , it delighted us . . . and yes , hyperbolic though it might seem to say so , it changed us . as much as it changed the people who watched movies , however , it changed the people who made movies even more . hollywood heads were sent spinning by the success of star wars , a film with no stars , a simplistic story-line out of old westerns and some nifty special effects . it was not long before studio executives realized that two fundamental lessons of star wars could be translated to other films : 1 ) if you made a special effects-laden adventure with a modicum of skill and dropped it into your summer release schedule , when young potential movie-goers had summer job money burning holes in their pockets , they would come and come again , story be damned ; 2 ) one successful film could turn into one or two more , plus action figures , lunchboxes and t-shirts ( the twin goddesses of franchising and merchandising ) . and they slew the medium-budget film , and there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth . you can't really blame lucas for what has happened to american film-making , though , because there is no way he intended for crass commercial concerns to become so dominant . there is no way star wars could have worked if he _had_ had such an intention . lost in all the ink spilled with references to joseph campbell , back-brain mythopoetics and anti-technological humanism is the fact that star wars was not a great movie . the most surprising thing a viewer might find in the special edition has nothing to do with with the dozens of critters tossed into the backgrounds , but rather how restless he might get waiting through the first half . star wars wasn't a great movie ; it was , however , an extraordinary movie-going experience . you sat in a theater with a few hundred other people and for two hours you were utterly transported , because it was innocent in a way no film can ever be innocent again . you felt as though you were part of something joyous , a celebration of cinema as fantasy and a celebration of good triumphing over evil . in an era when you can see the veins bulging on big-budget action films as they strain to impress you , star wars was effortless in its enchantment . that movie-going experience is what this re-release is all about . the difference between star wars on the big screen and star wars on the small screen is the difference between mount rushmore and a picture of mount rushmore , between wagner on a cassette deck and wagner played by a symphony orchestra . if there is an element of not-inconsequential element of nostalgia in the way crowds will flock to this re-release , that is understandable ; many will be hoping to re-capture a youthful moment when they fell in love with movies for the first time . star wars : special edition may end up disappointing those who come to it as though on a pilgrimage , but the dazzling editing of the climactic trench run will certainly remind anyone who has seen what passes for a "" spectacular "" in the last few years how exciting a science-fiction adventure film can be . there has been some consternation over the idea of lucas fiddling with such a cherished film , but frankly , i don't understand all the fuss . but if anything lucas has done threatens someone's memories of a first experience of star wars , i can only suggest that the experience couldn't have been terribly profound . in terms of the details , this is a different star wars , but it is the spirit of this story which has moved people for twenty years .

1901,"screenplay : leigh brackett and lawrence kasdan . director : irvin kirshner . mpaa rating : pg ( violence ) running time : 125 minutes . if pressed , i think most aficionados of the star wars trilogy would agree that the empire strikes back is the best of the three -- the best written , the best acted and the most skillfully constructed . however , it is not nearly as beloved as the original star wars , and though the newly released the empire strikes back : special edition is certain to be a success , it is unlikely to come close to inspiring the mania the return of star wars did on january 31st . so why will the same person who tells you to your face that empire is the better film only see it once this time around after seeing star wars two or three times ? the answers to that question -- and there are several -- are in some ways specific to this film . in other ways , they explain a lot about what people go to the movies to see , what they go to see _again_ , and why . what makes empire so extraordinary in retrospect is how many chances george lucas and his new crew -- director irvin kirshner and screenwriters lawrence kasdan and leigh brackett -- took when they had everything to lose by doing so . no image in star wars is as dark and creepy as luke's dream vision of his own face behind vader's mask , and obi-wan's vague homilies about the force in the original become yoda's extended lessons in an almost zen philosophy in empire . following a film which was the very definition of a crowd-pleaser , empire concluded with the good guys in disarray , one of them captured and another one crippled ( emotionally , if not ultimately physically ) . here was a blockbuster which had the audacity to mess with the most successful film formula anyone had yet discovered , a feature film which ended the way feature films just weren't supposed to end : with a cliff-hanger worthy of the old radio serials . those twists made the empire strikes back exciting and challenging in a way star wars wasn't , but they also made it a less satisfying movie-going experience . star wars ended with a victory for the heroes , a fanfare and a rousing ovation , allowing the audience to leave both entertained and with a basic sense of resolution . empire was not so generous . it took the simple good-vs . -evil the audience for a story set in that kind of world is smaller than the audience for a story set in star wars' morally bi-polar universe , and it's hard to imagine the empire strikes back would have been a success if it had been the first film to feature these same characters instead of star wars . the pure throw-back adventure of star wars was undemanding , but you were almost certain to leave the theater smiling , and ready to hop back on the ride again for yet another chance to come out smiling . meanwhile , the very complexity which made the empire strikes back a richer film also made it a film less likely to inspire multiple visits to the theater . after all , how many times did viewers want to be reminded that it was going to be another three years before they found out if darth vader was really . . . you fortunately , the special edition will inspire those who know star wars line for line to take a closer look at the empire strikes back , and it's not just what was there in 1980 which may impress them . there are fewer new touches than there were in the star wars : special edition , and those which are there -- a longer , more tense scene in which luke escapes a wampa on hoth ; enhanced footage of the arrival on cloud city -- are both less obtrusive and more useful . it is the sound , however , which is most spectacular in this new incarnation , an awesome demonstration of the kind of experience even a "" home theater "" can never possibly duplicate . the empire strikes back deserves its second theatrical life every bit as much as star wars , if not more , yet there were notably fewer people applauding at the end of empire . i'm not convinced that means the audience enjoyed it less ; i do think it means they will see it less . the amazing thing is that , in a cinematic economy where an unhappy ending is the kiss of death , george lucas dared to lure the star wars audience into a darker world at all .

1902,"screenplay : alexander payne and jim taylor . director : alexander payne . if you live in one of the half-dozen or so cities where miramax gave the film a trial run , you missed it months ago ; if you don't live in one of those cities , you never even got the chance to miss it . no one markets unconventional or controversial films better than miramax , but even they couldn't get more than a handful of people into theaters to see citizen ruth . you see , citizen ruth is about abortion . no , wait , it gets worse -- citizen ruth is a _comedy_ about abortion . it sets out to offend nearly everyone , and succeeds . it's got an unrepentant loser as its protagonist , and she's the most likeable character in the film . in short , citizen ruth has absolutely everything working against it except a blisteringly funny script , assured direction and a remarkably brave lead performance by laura dern . of course the other side isn't about to sit still for such tactics , eventually snaring ruth away from the stoneys to make their own political statement . if you were inclined to keep a tally , you'd probably find that alexander payne and co-writer jim taylor don't split their mockery evenly down the middle . that doesn't mean the pro-choice advocates get off easy . it's also hard not to chuckle at the terribly earnest paean one lesbian couple sings to the "" moon mother . "" there is only one place where the film-makers' sympathies obviously lie , and that is with ruth . you may have a hard time sharing that sympathy , however , because laura dern isn't interested in making you like ruth . it is a gutsy and brilliant performance , one on which the success of citizen ruth as a social satire depends . if ruth stoops is turned into one of the sanctified poor , the film collapses under the weight of its sincerity . she is a walking worst-case scenario , which makes it easy for both sides to use her as an example . it also makes it impossible for either side to control her , making for some of the funniest film moments of the year . payne's most extraordinary accomplishment may be satirizing both sides of a serious issue while never understating the seriousness of the issue itself . in fact , citizen ruth is really about how this particular battle has taken on a life of its own apart from the people affected by it . it is a telling moment . it's a shame that a subversively spectacular film like citizen ruth managed to walk away just as unnoticed .

1903,"screenplay : andrew w . marlowe . director : wolfgang petersen . the phenomenally popular presidency of ronald reagan , if nothing else , gave us a solid sense of what the american people really want in a chief executive . if that phrase doesn't describe harrison ford among all a-list hollywood stars , i don't know whom it does describe . that kind of man isn't just the perfect president -- he's also the perfect action hero . air force one is an extraordinarily effective thriller by any standard , but it's even better with ford on board . wolfgang petersen's direction combines the claustrophobia of das boot with the cat-and-mouse dynamic of in the line of fire , then throws in a few stomach-churning dogfights and mid-air escape attempts just for seasoning . there hasn't been a more assured piece of technical film-making in theaters this year , nor a more riveting action spectacle . ford , however , moves air force one from the realm of the mere thrill ride to something more potent . it is the "" honor "" part of that equation which may raise a few hackles over the rah-rah patriot games of air force one . still , andrew w . marlowe's script never feels jingo all the way . lecture me on the articles of war "" ) . in fact , every performer takes chances which make air force one more than a simple crowd-pleaser . the gutsiest choices may be those made by glenn close , playing vice-president kathryn bennett . in a more pandering film , bennett would have been the take-charge woman in a room full of ineffectual men . not that anyone could blame her . part of what makes air force one so satisfying -- and , at times , so wryly amusing -- is that it places president marshall squarely in the real world of 1990s american political consciousness . the unswerving devotion , the candlelight vigils and the tremendous popularity all make perfect sense as the reactions of cynics in the presence of true greatness . it's easy to get caught up in the thrills of air force one , not just because it is so well-constructed , but because we're watching a national fantasy . there's only one thing missing from the finale of air force one : harrison ford should step onto the tarmac at dulles , tip his hat to the assembled throng , sweep the first lady up onto his trusty horse , and ride into the sunset . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1904,"screenplay : john brancato and michael ferris . director : david fincher . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , intense situations ) running time : 123 minutes . there are bound to be fans of seven who will view director david fincher's follow-up project , the game , as a sell-out . . . but fincher's 1995 thriller may have been the decade's most baffling blockbuster -- a horrifying , unnerving , bleak vision of millennial dread which was everything a hollywood success wasn't supposed to be , yet still somehow made $100 million . it left viewers shaken and emotionally drained like nothing in recent memory . the wonderfully surprising thing about the game is that it may be the best choice fincher could have made . free from the ridiculous expectations of alien3 and the off-putting subject matter of seven , fincher might finally be recognized as the most gifted director of suspense films working today . the game is a gripping , dizzying and thoroughly entertaining thriller which bears no resemblance whatsoever to seven , except in the obvious talent of the director . he's not even sure when -- or if -- it will begin . and for the audience , that's half the fun . fincher wrings an unbelievable amount of tension out of the likelihood that something will happen , even though nothing is actually happening . then the game does begin , and fincher tightens the screws psychologically as well as viscerally . as tautly as he can fashion a chase or an action sequence , he's even better at creating a pervasive atmosphere of impending doom , or the unsettling possibility that literally anything could happen next . if action/suspense films , according to the popular metaphor , are roller-coasters , fincher's ride is a suspended roller-coaster : not only are you moving at breakneck speed , you can't even see the track to anticipate which way you're going to turn . that's saying quite a lot because , if you think about it carefully , you'll realize there's really only one way the film can pay off . even though you may know where the game ultimately will end up , fincher makes sure you don't know how you're going to get there . the game's somewhat predictable script comes from the team of john brancato and michael ferris , who sent sandra bullock through similar everyperson-in-peril paces in the net . don't let that keep you away . michael douglas' characteristic intensity and determination give the game an edge bullock couldn't muster , while fincher sets up even simple shots with a shudder-inducing elegance ( i'm not sure i've seen an elevator door open with more menace than it does in the game , and that includes the shining ) . this time , however , it's possible to enjoy fincher's shudders with a smile . the game may not be as profound an experience as seven , but it's a more satisfying one . if this is david fincher's idea of selling out , i hope folks are buying . we may be looking at the emergence of this generation's hitchcock . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1905,"running time : 150 minutes . potential viewers who may be scared away from boogie nights by its subject matter , take note : you're not likely to find a more potent morality tale anywhere this year . the milieu may be the pornography industry of the late 1970s and early 1980s , but those with prurient interest need not apply . boogie nights is that rare example of riveting film-making which also instructs , so unobtrusively you almost can't tell you're being instructed . never has the self-delusional narcissism of the "" me decade "" been portrayed with such an eye to the repercussions . boogie nights does a spectacular job of re-creating its era , with its pee-chee folders , 8-track tapes and fresca , but its greater triumph is making the tunnel vision of its characters both hilarious and pathetic . when jack's sincere pronouncement that he longs to make story-centered sex films clashes with our glimpses of the mechanical , blank-faced films he is creating , it's enough to make you laugh out loud ; when dirk proudly shows off his "" imported italian nylon "" print shirts , it's like watching a smug dinosaur blissfully unaware of his own impending extinction . the characters in boogie nights have no sense that everything they do and everything they enjoy will soon be considered utterly ridiculous -- or worse , that they will cast a shadow over the rest of their lives . that is exactly what happens as boogie nights blasts into the 80s with a literal bang . the pace flags somewhat in the second half hour , but in a way it had to -- after the coke-fuelled pool parties , all that remains to show us is the inevitable , painful hangover . appropriately , there isn't much about the final 45 minutes of boogie nights which could be considered "" fun . "" cautionary story-telling rarely gets this grim , electrifying and compelling . the most talked-about moment in boogie nights will probably be the final shot , in which wahlberg finally displays the equipment ( prosthetically-enhanced , if you must know ) which has been the subject of so much discussion through the rest of the film . it would be easy to consider that moment gratuitious , but it would be just as inappropriate as thinking of boogie nights just as a movie about the porno business . in effect , the whole film is about the ultimate "" dick thing , "" a group of people who simply can't see the world beyond what's going on between their legs . dirk's pep talk to his own genitalia undercuts the seemingly idyllic conclusion which precedes it -- it turns out he hasn't really learned much of anything . viewers , on the other hand , have a chance to learn more than they might expect from boogie nights . . . for instance , that sometimes a sex film isn't just a sex film . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1906,"producers : howard ashman and john musker . mpaa rating : g . running time : 82 minutes . it may be an exaggeration to say that the little mermaid saved feature animation from extinction . if so , it's not much of one . in 1989 , when mermaid was first released , only one man in hollywood seemed to believe that family films weren't inevitably box office poison : disney's jeffrey katzenberg , who re-committed disney to its historical life's-blood after costly flops like the black cauldron . the wonderful thing about the little mermaid is the wonderful thing about most unwitting trend-setters : it was made not to set trends , but to be an entertaining film . the were looking _backward_ , to the reasons disney's classic cartoons endured , beginning with a timeless story ( hans christian andersen's fairy tale , tweaked for an appropriately happy ending ) . musker and clements crafted the little mermaid with attention to the fundamentals of storytelling , little things like coherent plotting , charming characterizations and clever writing . they made sure they had key elements like an appropriately loathsome villain and sharp comic relief , applied the talents of a gifted group of character animators and voice actors , and ended up with a minor gem on their hands . they also realized the crucial role of music in the disney animated canon , so they made the smartest of all the decisions which went into the little mermaid : they got alan menken and howard ashman to score it . the latter two proved to be among disney's most delightful tunes ever , adding the special spark which turned samuel e . wright's already-exceptional vocal performance as sebastian into the stuff of classics . in fact , even the minor numbers in the little mermaid were strong enough to re-surface later ( listen again to "" les poissons , "" and tell me you don't hear the beta version of beauty and the beast's "" be our guest "" ) . disney has re-released many of its animated films to theaters in recent years , but there's something special about the return of the little mermaid . it's not that it's the best of disney's new wave , not even with digitally improved prints and multi-track sound . beauty and the beast provided richer characters , aladdin was more energetic , and the hunchback of notre dame was more emotionally resonant . its exuberance and humor made animation hip again , which may be why the little mermaid marked the turning point for feature animation as a viable commercial entity . a trail-blazer deserves some respect . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1907,"fast , cheap & out of control may be the most reflexive film experience of the year , as well as one of the richest . as he did in previous efforts like gates of heaven and a brief history of time , director errol morris charges the non-fiction film with a unique energy as he celebrates the out-liers of american culture . for 85 minutes morris lets them speak passionately about their crafts , until you begin to suspect that fast , cheap & out of control is less about those four men than it is about morris himself . that's not to say that the four men are not interesting subjects . mendez proves to be the star of the bunch , an animated character in a butterfly bow tie who discusses the mole rat with a delight transcending scholarship ; brooks also offers his insights on artificial intelligence with the wide-eyed , mad-scientist glee . yet morris isn't necessarily interested in painting detailed portraits of his four subjects . frequently , he simply uses their voices to underscore stock footage , or scenes unrelated to their specific occupations . morris teases with darting images , forcing us to draw connections where connections aren't obvious . each is both an explorer and ( in the film's most frequent motif ) a circus performer -- they do what others would never think of doing with an enviable singularity of purpose . where most documentarians seek to capture nobility or significance through big names or big events , morris peers into more obscure corners to find the beauty in eccentricity ; where most documentarians consider overtly "" cinematic "" non-fiction works somehow tainted , morris creates vivid visual tapestries which should make oliver stone shake his head in embarrassment ( and he uses stone's frequent cinematographer robert richardson , just to compound the misery ) . simply put , morris creates daring , captivating work in a convention-bound genre . perhaps one could see fast , cheap & out of control as self-congratulatory , if it weren't such a giddy , intellectual thrill ride . when mendez shares the idea that "" the other isn't something to be feared , it's something to be explored . . . it's trying to figure out the purpose that interests me , "" he could be speaking for the director , or for any viewer ready to view the human circus through new eyes . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1908,"producers : jane rosenthal , barry levinson and robert deniro . director : barry levinson . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 95 minutes . here's how i know i'm watching a truly brilliant piece of socio-political satire : even as i'm laughing , i'm not sure whether i shouldn't actually be cringing in fear for my country . strangelove inspired that kind of reaction , as did network and moments in m * a * s * h and being there . working with a magnificent script by hilary henkin and david mamet , director barry levinson creates the kind of film which leaves you teary-eyed from laughter and slack-jawed in astonishment at its dark audacity . the premise of wag the dog feels torn from today's scandal-filled headlines . wag the dog rolls out the hilarious situations with such punishing frequency that it's virtually impossible to select highlights . some of the most subtle but scathing barbs target the media , who lap up the images provided by the president's people far too readily , riding the wave rather than bucking the tide . like all the finest satire , wag the dog is just absurd enough to be hilarious , and just plausible enough to be alarming . the truly impressive thing about henkin and mamet's script is that it finds time amid all the comic pot-shots to create a genuinely fascinating character in stanley motss . hoffman plays motss as an insecure mogul determined to achieve the recognition he feels has been unfairly denied him , even though breen continues to insist that this particular story can never become one of his war stories . it's easily hoffman's best performance in over a decade : sly , funny , angry , self-absorbed , infuriating and absolutely delightful . though wag the dog focuses almost entirely on the actions of the president's shadow cabinet , it's not exactly an indictment of political dirty tricks . if anything , the real villains in wag the dog are the american people -- not just for accepting the phony war , but for making it necessary in the first place . the script strongly suggests that the accusations made against the president are false , but the facts of the matter are instantly irrelevant . wag the dog is a dazzling , thought-provoking entertainment which alternately tickles you and slaps you in the face , providing a warning that it's easy to keep making fools out of us if we keep making it so easy . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1909,"sometimes the term "" high concept "" doesn't do a film justice . critics are partly to blame , since we use the term perjoratively to refer to studios' tendency to mix and match stars or previously successful film plots to create easy-to-sell , easy-to-digest packages . that certainly doesn't describe the truman show , though the premise is about as high concept as they come : a 29-year-old man named truman burbank ( jim carrey ) gradually becomes aware that his entire life has been the subject of a carefully controlled , 24-hour-a-day documentary/soap opera called "" the truman show , "" the most popular program in television history . no , there's nothing easy to digest about the truman show , which is exactly what makes it so brilliant . masterfully conceived and executed , as thought-provoking as it is hilarious , the truman show is everything studio film-making should be but almost never is . it would be easy enough to praise the film to the skies simply for creating its world so seamlessly . for nearly 45 minutes director peter weir permits only isolated intrusions from the "" real world "" reacions of viewers , wrapping the viewer in the inescapable "" reality "" in which truman lives . the emotional content behind that premise makes the truman show far more than a clever exercise in style . jim carrey's performance as truman is deceptively complex , because he's playing a character who often behaves with the forced good nature of a sit-come character . truman is like a child under the thumb of a domineering parent , which adds depth to the character of christof ( ed harris ) , the show's creator and director . in small moments we see christof behaving with the concern and tenderness of a father , but it's a twisted and controlling love . before it begins to appear that the truman show is a touch-feely triumph of the spirit story complete with swelling strings , i should note that weir and writer andrew niccol ( gattaca ) come at the material from a subversive and satirical angle . as much as it is about truman himself , the truman show is also about the phenomenon of television viewership , and more specifically about the phenomenon of blaming the media for giving the people what they want . the truman show recognizes that we are a nation of voyeurs who jeer programmers for pandering to our voyeuristic nature . the film's most memorable moment may be its final scene , where a heroic finale is twisted with a knowing nod to the fact that there will always be an audience for the next "" truman show .

1910,"screenplay : robert rodat . producers : steven spielberg , ian bryce , mark gordon & gary levinsohn . director : steven spielberg . mpaa rating : r ( intense wartime violence and gore , profanity ) running time : 170 minutes . the first and last image in saving private ryan , a war story of shattering visceral and emotional force , is an american flag waving in the breeze . it's a bold choice , one that defines what makes this film so unique among modern war films . for over 25 years in the post-vietnam era , american war films have reminded us over and over again that war is a chaotic and futile endeavor characterized by gleeful brutality and morality of convenience . even the most well-received examples -- the deer hunter , apocalypse now , platoon , full metal jacket -- trafficked in violence and psychological devastation as though they were the only facets of the wartime experience worth exploring . the stories were less about the people in war than about war itself as an existential disease . saving private ryan may be the most mature war film ever made , because it combines the horrifying realism of contemporary war films with the sense of purpose conveyed in the patriotic adventures of the 1940s . the reluctance of miller's men to take on this mission is understandable , since it's amazing enought that any of them survived the initial assault on the beach . it's hard to begin describing the film artistry involved : that half hour is disturbing , surreal , at times darkly humorous , simultaneously too intense to watch and impossible _not_ to watch . if it had been spielberg's intent to play a game of wartime can-you-top-this with his contemporary peers -- and you never believe for a second that it was -- the contest wouldn't even be close . cinematic warfare has never been more agonizing . nor , in its way , has it ever been more human . hanks delivers his finest performance yet as miller , whose trembling hand betrays demons his men can only guess at ; barry pepper radiates steely-eyed confidence as sharpshooter pvt . the most harrowing performance , however , comes from jeremy davies as cpl . in one brilliantly acted scene , upham's psyche vanishes into the rubble . this being a tale of the "" last noble war "" in american history , it's also about heroism , though not in a conventional sense . faced with an assignment everyone considers fubar -- an acronym for the saltier version of "" fouled up beyond all recognition "" -- miller and his men are forced to make it make sense . this is the sort of heroism saving private ryan examines : not the heroism of men fighting an obviously evil enemy for an obviously just cause , but the heroism of men taking responsibility for doing their duty to the best of their ability . it becomes the ability to make meaning from the hell war always has been and always will be . steven spielberg , who set a new standard for himself with schindler's list , actually manages to raise that standard in saving private ryan , which isn't to say that it's a perfect film . john williams score may not be as intrusive as it was in amistad -- but then , how _could_ it be ? -- but it still underscores scenes best left silent , and one late scene is a bit too reminiscent of schindler's "" i could have done more "" speech . yet even in that moment spielberg drives home his unique , provocative vision . late in the film , a character tells ryan , "" earn this , "" handing him the responsibility for making his life -- and the lives of those who died for his sake -- matter . that waving flag which opens and closes saving private ryan is a challenging sort of patriotism , free from self-righteous over-simplifications like "" good war "" vs . "" bad war . "" with the grace and power of great cinema , spielberg makes accountability in the midst of tragedy absolutely individual . he forces you to stare inward and ask whether you've earned this -- this life , this country , this freedom . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .

1911,"special note : longtime readers will realize that i am breaking with a longstanding tradition of reviewing only theatrical films . there is a very good reason . please note the air times listed above and don't miss this one . the best documentaries , like the best art of any kind , have always been about more than their easily-summarized subject . great documentary film-makers take individual lives and find stories that resonate beyond the individuals whose lives are being explored . hitman hart : wrestling with shadows is set in the world of professional wrestling , and shame on you if that's enough to keep you from watching . actually , "" happens to be a wrestler "" may be an understatement . manhood meant no compromise and no submission , inside the ring or out of it . this background provides a crucial context for the central story of bret's fall from grace within the wwf . unfortunately , he extended that criticism to the wwf itself , arguing that the family entertainment morality plays of the 1980s glory days -- hulk hogan urging kids to "" say their prayers and take their vitamins "" -- had given way to increasing vulgarity and the glorification of villains . and mcmahon , needless to say , was not pleased . as clearly as vince mcmahon is the villain of this piece , he also makes one extremely insightful comment about bret hart : "" he forgot that this is sports entertainment .

1912,"screenplay : daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez . producers : gregg hale and robin cowie . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , intense situations ) running time : 86 minutes . the last of the 34 films i screened at sundance this year was not merely the best film the festival had to offer . the blair witch project is a work of genre-redefining brilliance , a strong early candidate for the best film of 1999 , and one of the most unnerving psychological thrillers ever made . it works on the kind of primal level that will leave you shaking for hours afterwards . it's the kind of film for which festivals like this truly exist . the concept alone is ingenious enough to grab interest ( though not utterly unique ) : an on-screen caption at the beginning of the film announces that three college students disappeared in the black hills of maryland in 1994 while making a documentary film , and that only the footage they shot was ever found . the interviews are frequently quite funny -- including a mother whose toddler grows disturbed by the scary story she's telling -- while they also provide insight that the filmmakers really don't take the legend very seriously . writer/directors daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez don't just set up a scary story -- they set up the people to whom this scary story will happen . and folks , scary ain't even the half of it . the blair witch project is the kind of film that wreaks its havoc almost entirely in your head , just as the events in the film wreak havoc in the heads of the characters . the directors use darkness and sound with shudder-inducing effectiveness , never once resorting to cheap , trite tricks like people jumping into frame or blasts of dissonant music ( there is , in fact , no musical underscore of any kind ) . some viewers may be put off by the fact that the set-up guarantees a bad end for the protagonists , or incredulous regarding why they would continue to record their experiences . those elements might have troubled me had the blair witch project not established its characters so well that they mattered more than the situation in which they find themselves . all three of the largely-improvised performances are dead on -- i dare a viewer to find a moment when you can tell anyone is acting -- but heather donahue's work is emotionally shattering . the blair witch project works as a study of disintegrating humanity only because we feel the humanity of these three brash kids to begin with . you expect a good horror film to be terrifying . what makes this one great -- perhaps one of the best ever -- is that it's also heartbreaking . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1913,"screenplay : charlie kaufman . director : spike jonze . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 112 minutes . leave aside for a moment -- and you won't hear this out of me very often -- such mundane questions as what being john malkovich is "" about , "" or what it "" means . "" it is a rare occurrence when a film so completely engulfs me in its singularity that i know i'll miss something if i try to figure it out while watching , but that's exactly what happened with being john malkovich . it's no coincidence that the ad campaign featured music from brazil ; like terry gilliam's stunning 1985 film , it's a vision that begins "" somewhere in the 20th century , "" then takes a left turn into somewhere inspired and unexpected . for nearly two hours , you can revel in the pleasure of letting its surreal , subversive humor roll over you in waves . for hours afterward , you can peel away its layers of significance and realize how truly extraordinary it is . attempting to distill screenwriter charlie kaufman's story into a few short sentences can't possibly do it justice . there are so many improbably wonderful moments in being john malkovich that it would be criminal to deprive potential viewers of the joy of discover . suffice it to say that kaufman and director spike jonze ( the video and commercial wunderkind making his feature film debut ) find a new and hilarious place to go every time you think they can't possibly find anywhere more whacked-out than where they've just been . every performance is a comedic gem , none more so than a turn by malkovich that re-defines "" self-deprecating "" ( even in a film where his consciousness is the center of the universe ) . there are giggles , there are guffaws , and then there is laughter that comes from sheer awestruck surprise . guess which kind being john malkovich engenders . if being john malkovich had been nothing more than a blissfully bent comedy , it still would have been one of the year's best films . buried beneath the surface surrealism is an exploration of identity that slides from the addictive nature of virtual reality to the appeal of performance . i speculated after the film whether the premise would work with just any actor -- being harrison ford , for instance , or being julia roberts -- and i don't think it would . malkovich's unconventional looks and chameleonic character acting become one of the film's running jokes ( no one can quite remember what movies they've seen him in ) , making him the ideal vessel for a visitor to re-create himself . there's plenty more to being john malkovich for those willing to poke around for a while -- students of medieval french philosophy may ponder the significance of craig casting his own puppet doppleganger as abelard in "" abelard and heloise , "" considering where he ends up in the film -- the kind of stuff you just don't expect to find in contemporary film . you certainly don't expect to find it in a film that's ridiculously entertaining even if you don't think about it afterward for a second . being john malkovich is a kind of pop masterpiece -- funny , insightful , smart , playful and heartbreaking . few films provide such a thrilling sense of discovery , a discovery that lingers from the first frames to subsequent days . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1914,"1993 has been quite a year for films with chinese and chinese-american themes . now comes cannes film festival palme d'or co-winner farewell my concubine , and it becomes clear that everything else was just a warm-up . director chen kaige has fashioned a drama mesmerizing from first frame to last , and does so without getting artsy or obscure . this is a remarkably accessible epic , and the best film of this year in any language . as adults , the two become the most renowned opera stars in beijing , and adopt new stage names . perhaps the most astonishing thing about farewell is that in spite of its scope , it's really a very simple , old-fashioned love triangle which happens to be about a man and a woman both in love with the same man . the three principals are bold and dynamic characters , each of whom never does exactly what is expected . rather , he treats dieyi more or less as nothing but a co-worker , a man whom he likes and even needs for his career , but doesn't really respect . then there is juxian , perhaps the strongest character emotionally , self-assured to a fault in male-dominated china and capable in that confidence of surprising displays of forgiveness . her conflict with dieyi powers farewell's most haunting moments . chen kaige's direction demonstrates a mastery of composition and narrative structure rarely seen . the opening sequence , a reunion between dieyi and xiaolou which frames the flashbacks to come , is a triumph of lighting and texture . chen crafts brilliant cuts , such as a cut from xiaolou's announcement of his engagement to juxian , and his request for dieyi "" to be my best man , "" to a full screen closeup of dieyi , still in his concubine makeup and looking not like a "" best man "" but a rejected woman . every shot is a minor revelation , raising chen to the level of one of modern cinema's true masters . no amount of hyperbole will get some filmgoers to see a 2 1/2 hour story with subtitles about marginalized characters . i can't think of a greater artistic tragedy . farewell my concubine is a thrilling love story , a political epic and an intimate character study rolled into one stunning package . if you've never seen a non-english language film before , find this one . it's just that good .

1915,"screenplay : ruth prawer jhabvala . director : james ivory . i was not among those who considered howards end one of the top ten films of 1992 . as beautiful and well-acted as it was , i felt it offered a fragmented and somewhat unsatisfying treatment of e . m . forster's novel . therefore i did not approach the remains of the day , the new film from the merchant/ivory production stable , as a blessing dropped directly from heaven . it appears i should have . the remains of the day will draw much the same audience as howards end and the age of innocence , but it corrects nearly every flaw in each of those films , focusing on one character played to near perfection by anthony hopkins . the remains of the day is an exceptional adaptation of the award-winning novel by kazuo ishiguro . rather than inflate the romance between stevens and miss kenton out of proportion , screenwriter ruth prawer jhabvala wisely keeps the focus on stevens' universe as a butler . he is a character committed to a fault to his ideals of servanthood , expressed in one pithy line : "" i don't believe a man can conisder himself fully content until he has done all he can to be of service to his employer . "" it is only because these relationships with darlington and his father are so fully developed that the relationship between stevens and miss kenton can be convincingly poignant . it also doesn't hurt that anthony hopkins turns in the single best male performance of the year as stevens . it is not so much his ability to deliver a line which raises him above the pack , although he is brilliant there as well ; rather , it is his precise command of shrugs , turns of the head and almost imperceptible eye movements that is incomparable . it's wonderfully funny because stevens is trying so desperately to maintain his dignity in an inherently undignified situation . this is one of the finest physical performances in many years , beginning with one of the first moments he appears on screen , walking with stooped shoulders through an empty parlor . the technical end of the remains of the day is , as expected , glorious as well . director james ivory creates some marvelous shots , many framed through windows to lend a sense of voyeurism . the photography is sharp , capturing the vastness of darlington hall expertly , and a beautiful score by richard robbins lends the perfect air of gentility . the remains of the day is just as visually striking as howards end , and the performances are just as solid . what gives remains an edge over its much-lauded cousin is a more focused narrative which is riveting where howards end wandered . the world of stevens the butler is one well worth visiting for a thoroughly magnificent film experience .

1916,"screenplay : steven zaillian . director : steven spielberg . back in august , i wrote the following : "" if schindler's list is even halfway decent , steven spielberg will be nominated for best director , and probably win . "" that statement was based on the assumption that such an award would basically be a lifetime achievement recognition , like al pacino's best actor win last year , as well as an industry-wide "" thank you "" for the coattails business provided by jurassic park . i didn't expect that if he did win , he would actually deserve it . but with schindler's list , spielberg has crafted a nearly perfect film , a gripping and brilliantly acted epic which is not only the best film of 1993 , but probably the best film of the decade thus far . longtime viewers of spielberg films will scarcely recognize his hand in schindler's list . with the exception of a risky epilogue , gone too is the cloying manipulation of emotion . this is a mature , restrained spielberg , and his narrative decisions are right on the money . one scene after another is expertly staged , too many individual moments to mention but each and every one liable to leave an indelible mark on your memory . what allows schindler's list to work both as fine drama and vivid historical document is screenwriter steven zaillian's ( searching for bobby fischer ) decision to make the characters as memorable as the images . liam neeson manages both sides of schindler skillfully , making the transition seamlessly . ben kingsley turns in a typically understated performance as stern , the "" good angel "" who must walk a delicate line while encouraging schindler's magnanimity . the finest performance is also the most disturbing , ralph fiennes' perfectly amoral amon goeth . all three performances are among the finest of the year , and they give schindler's list a personal quality that transcends the subject matter . my feeling is that this is part of a larger attempt to make the holocaust a tragedy of individuals rather than of a faceless mass . in this way , he assaults the viewer both with staggering numbers and with individual lives . there are many disturbing images of arbitrary murder , of death without pattern or meaning , and in the midst of such arbitrariness one act of mercy could mean everything . lest we forget .

1917,"screenplay : joel coen and ethan coen , based on "" the odyssey "" by homer . director : joel coen . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 107 minutes . funny , but i don't remember them turning up in my western civilizations reading list . if you really want a sense of what the coens are after in o brother , where art thou ? , it helps to know the origin of the title . ultimately , he discovers that people love frivolous comedies , and that there's no shame in creating them . forget epics of the common man ; make them laugh , and you've got them right where you want them , and right where they want to be . i'm not sure i could make an argument for the coens' o brother , where art thou ? being flawless film-making . it is , however , the most utterly demented , unashamedly un-important and purely entertaining film experience i've had all year . essentially , there's nothing to o brother , where art thou ? but a string of comic misadventures . coen brothers characters don't often occupy a particularly moral universe , so there's not really a lesson or point to any of it . it's an exercise in free-form narrative cinema , held together by the coens' distinctive whip-smart dialogue and their gift for putting the right face on every role . and it's constantly , gut-bustingly hilarious . viewers who have been lukewarm to previous coen projects aren't likely to become converts this time around , but if you're in tune with their warped sensibilities , you're in for a treat . is the kind of film you'll spend most of the time watching with your mouth open , either laughing out loud or in dumbfounded amazement at what they're able to put on a screen . and few things are as dumbfoundingly amazing as george clooney's loose-limbed comic performance , the kind of work that forces you to re-think an actor's versatility . in a cast full of great comics and coen film veterans ( turturro , durning , hunter , john goodman ) , clooney steals the show . it happens to be a joyous show he's stealing . somewhere creeping around the edges of o brother is a commentary on our need for religion and mythology even in an "" age of reason , "" with its combination of greek legend and american folk tales . it would be ridiculous , however , to argue that this is the coens' personal "" odyssey . "" it dips and swerves , hits its lulls then tears back into remarkably goofy set pieces . there's no important message here , no contemporary re-working of an ancient classic . this , folks , is film-making that aims for nothing more profound than the funny bone . this , folks , in all its glory , is frivolous comedy . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject "" subscribe "" .

1918,"screenplay/director : boaz yakin . the recent commercial and critical success of such urban-themed films as boys n the hood and menace ii society is proving to be a strange double-edged sword . while they have inspired more films focused on inner city life , there seems to be a developing perception among mainstream moviegoers that they are more or less interchangeable , that if you've seen one film with urban kids shooting at each other , you've seen them all . not only does this perception perpetuate the idea that there is only one story to tell about the inner cities , but it can force some fantastic films to the margins before they even have a chance . witness fresh , a powerful urban drama that ranks among the year's best and most devastating works . fresh easily could have been just another drama about drugs n the hood , but what makes it truly harrowing is its focus on pre-teenagers . fresh is smart enough to realize that the trash talk of the streets means nothing , but for his classmates , particularly the loud-mouthed chuckie ( luis lantigua ) , it is a rite of passage . writer-director boaz yakin creates a portrait of doomed youth that is gripping and gut-churning . the centerpiece of this study is a stunning performance by young sean nelson as fresh . his reaction to one of the film's pivotal scenes , involving a shootout in a schoolyard , is jaw-dropping , and it's only one of many wrenching moments he has to carry . the film's third act only works because we believe that fresh is so sharp and observant , and the final scene only works because we understand how much he wishes it hadn't been necessary . nelson gets more than enough assistance from a superb supporting cast . though similar to laurence fishburne's character in searching for bobby fischer , it's more layered , and more imbued with history . from top to bottom the performers do just a little more than you might expect , turning the stereotype into a flesh and blood character . in many ways , fresh is an extremely pessimistic film , and as such will be difficult to watch . it is about innocence corrupted , described in shocking detail with no punches pulled . i left fresh with my mouth literally hanging open , affected to the bone by a spectacular piece of storytelling .

1919,"screenplay : paul attanasio . director : robert redford . there is a certain irony to the involvement of robert redford in the making of quiz show . much like quiz show's anti-hero charles van doren , redford became a star based on nothing so much as his golden boy good looks and charm . there is perhaps even more irony in the selling of quiz show as a story about a loss of american innocence , since it may be the ultimate debunking of the myth of the eisenhower-era american dream . brilliantly written and directed , it is a tale of how television sold us what we wanted to believe about our country , and a frighteningly contemporary examination of the cult of image . quiz show opens with a visually arresting sequence which perfectly establishes the foundation for redford and screenwriter paul attanasio . it's all about the dream , a dream of equal opportunity that doesn't exist on the quiz show's carefully controlled , demographically attractive selection of champions . morrow's is just one of a half-dozen performances in quiz show which will draw academy award consideration . veteran actor paul scofield is dynamic as mark van doren , whose mere commanding presence does as much to explain the younger van doren's motivations as fiennes' performance ; their scenes together are spectacular . david paymer is also noteworthy as the slick and savvy enright . for my money , however , the true star of quiz show is paul attanasio , whose screenplay is certainly the finest of the year . every characterization is full and rounded ; every scene is a perfect development of theme . the dialogue is filled with crisp , subtle and quotable lines . in one perfect moment , charles van doren's indignant insistence to enright that "" i am a professor at columbia , "" is followed by a studio gopher who announces , "" the professor's needed in makeup . "" quiz show is yet another example of what is possible when a script is this good , the direction is perfectly complementary , and the acting is first-rate . the film to beat as 1994's best picture has arrived .

1920,"it's pretty rare when a documentary gets a theatrical release . it's even more rare , about as frequent as sonny and cher reunions , when documentaries end up playing in multiplexes . but sure enough , i checked my local theater listings to discover that hoop dreams was playing not at one of the local "" art houses , "" but at the sixteen screen multiplex . if it means that more people will see this exceptional film , i'm all for it . hoop dreams is not just a film about basketball ; it is about as insightful a film about the american inner city experience as you will find , with more drama than a dozen fiction films . part of the tremendous appeal of hoop dreams comes from the fascinating cast of characters to which we are introduced . but for all its impressive scope , hoop dreams would not have worked had it only been about kids playing basketball . hoop dreams is thought-provoking , but it is also entertaining . it is not simply a great documentary ; it is one of the best films of any kind you will see this year .

1921,"screenplay : krzysztof kieslowski and krzysztof piesiewicz . welcome to that annual year-end tradition , "" guess which foreign language film gets jobbed by the motion picture academy rules . "" politics and arbitrary interpretations continue to rob the category of worthy nominees , and this year will be no exception : red , the third installment in krzysztof kieslowski's extraordinary three colors trilogy , has been rejected as an entry from switzerland . the academy should rectify that slight immediately and nominate it as one of the best films of the year in any language , a beautiful , resonant work that is the best of three very good films . but the owner , joseph kern ( jean-louis trintingnant ) , appears less than concerned about the dog , or much of anything for that matter . red is for fraternity , but as was also true of blue and white , the treatment of that theme is far from the obvious . this brings up the question of whether it is necessary to have seen blue and white to fully appreciate red . i feel irresponsible discouraging seeing this film in even the slightest manner , because it has so much to offer on its own merits . the production design is stunning , and zbigniew preisner's score again provides amazing depth . that said , i truly believe that there are layers of red which are best understood when viewed through the lens of the complete trilogy . and in red's emotional climax , the lead characters from all three films appear , and an understanding of what those other characters have been through to end up together makes the scene infinitely more potent . that is what makes red so special : it has a scope and a heart which , when combined with blue and white , is truly breathtaking . this is the work of a filmmaker at the height of his creative powers , which makes kieslowski's announcement that he is retiring a genuine tragedy . red stands independently as a great film ; the three colors together create a miraculous tapestry , one of the great film experiences of the decade .

1922,"screenplay : richard linklater and kim krizan . director : richard linklater . there , now that i have dutifully trotted out all the terms that are * supposed * to apply to before sunrise , perhaps we can talk about what it really is . that is increasingly difficult to do with relationship-based films about characters in their 20s , which seem to come with generational baggage by the ton , and even harder to do when the director of the film in question is richard ( slacker ) linklater . but leave your pre-conceptions at the door , and you will be rewarded with a nearly perfect romance , a sweet , funny and poignant character study which , if there is any justice , will make julie delpy a star . before sunrise is likely to be a very polarizing kind of film , because it consists almost entirely of conversation between jesse and celine . there is a certain segment of the viewing public which will be driven to distracion by such a structure , and they should do themselves a favor and avoid it . i could argue with these individuals all day , and not convince them to see what i saw in before sunrise : two complex characters developing as genuine a relationship as you could hope to see on the screen . linklater and co-screenwriter kim krizan allow jesse and celine to unfold slowly , so that the characters we think we have figured out early in the film turn out to be something very different by the end . even in isolation , i found getting to know these characters fascinating . together , i found them even more remarkable . ethan hawke and julie delpy both deliver marvelous performances , developing an affection and connection which always seems absolutely real . while both are impressive , it is delpy who commands the camera's attention ; every reaction is on target , and every line seems spontaneous . in that one look , delpy says as much about what this film is about--the risk of romance--than all the dialogue . i keep returning to certain terms when thinking about and describing before sunrise--perfect , genuine , real . if that is so , it is because i have seen film after film over the past few years try to pass itself off as a romance without demonstrating the most cursory understanding about the way a real relationship develops . linklater does so many things right , but i would like to bring attention to things he * doesn't * do . he doesn't wait until the final reel for jesse and celine to kiss , accompanied by a full orchestra ; he doesn't manufacture pointless conflict ; and most astonishingly , he doesn't ever have them say "" i love you . "" before sunrise is about a single night which will become a perfect memory , and i am beginning to believe that is what the film will become for me . "
1923,"screenplay : john sayles . director : john sayles . this is how far i trust john sayles' skill as a writer : in the few hours after i saw lone star , when i couldn't quite get the pieces to fit together , i figured _i_ had to be missing something . perhaps more than any other filmmaker's next project , i look forward to the next john sayles project like a christmas gift . while he is still growing as a director , his scripts are so unapologetically and relentlessly literate -- and literary -- that unwrapping them is its own kind of pleasure . lone star , as much as any film of the last several years , is a novel on the screen , and a marvelous one . when i finally did put those pieces together , i realized how justified my faith had been . on its most basic level , lone star is a superbly acted study of life in a border town . the cast is uniformly in tune with sayles' naturalistic style , particularly chris cooper in a subtle but powerful performance as sam ; even frances mcdormand , as sam's manic-depressive ex-wife , lends humanity to an edgy role in her single scene . the multi-ethnic cast provides a solid foundation for an examination of a place where the "" melting pot "" is anything but . it is a place which , while less overtly racist than it was during charley wade's reign in the 1950s , is still characterized by an omnipresent sense of "" us "" and "" them . "" and that is the other thread running through lone star : the nature of history . in an early scene , parents of various ethnicities sit in pilar's classroom arguing over the way she is teaching the battle of the alamo , the white parents attacking her for suggesting that there is another perspective from which it could be viewed . then , finally , i saw it as absolutely crucial . at times it seems that sayles is suggesting that the only history that has a chance of being re-interpreted is the history which has yet to be created . lone star is a haunting film , which deals with unexpectedly delicate subject matter with startling confidence . the experience of watching the film sticks with me because i didn't just sit through two hours of film ; i was reading people's lives . that is the kind of filmmaker john sayles is : an author with a camera . "
1924,"screenplay : nicholas kazan , robin swicord . director : danny devito . every once in a while , when an exceptional family film comes along , i will attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put their money where their mouths have been ; with all the hubbub over the lack of films suitable for children , it is remarkable how many non-disney films disappear in a couple of weeks . now i see that in so doing , i have unfairly ghettoized these films . so i am issuing my challenge not just to parents , but to anyone who wants to support smart , funny , energetic film-making : see matilda . see it in a theater , rather than shrugging and waiting for it on video . see the best film i have seen in 1996 . not the best children's film . . . the best film . period . the wormwoods barely notice matilda exists , and when they do , it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books . it was this spring's james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them , and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda . and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton , matilda soars on the cock-eyed direction of danny devito . devito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses , and he contributes some memorable images . matilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale . it is also characteristic of the best children's tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost don't realize that they are learning them . matilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment , and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child -- that because "" i'm big and you're little , i'm right and you're wrong . "" more specifically , it has as its heroine an intelligent , self-confident girl who struggles successfully against other people's notions of how she should behave . it is no coincidence that matilda was co-written by robin swicord , who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women . finally , matilda has that quality i find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment : it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word . devito knows enough to make matilda fast-paced and appealing to children , taking a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy , including a great chase through her dark house . the child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable , with mara wilson making matilda a clever and extremely likeable character . i can't imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted . matilda is a film which left me glowing with good feeling . i will see it again , and years from now i will watch it with my children . and now i will stop , because somewhere near you matilda is about to begin , and there is a seat in that theater you should be in , if you have a child or ever were a child . "
1925,"screenplay : stanley tucci , joseph tropiano . running time : 108 minutes . it probably says as much about me as it does about big night that i consider it a remarkably insightful film about the state of contemporary film-making . however , i think big night is something particularly special for anyone who loves movies because of what they can be . it is a warm , engaging and extremely funny film which manages not simply to describe the battle between art and commerce , but to win it on behalf of the former . his own character of secondo is the film's central figure , but all three main characters are superbly written and acted . ian holm has a tasty , showy role as the unapologetically assimilated pascal , who runs his restaurant like a circus ; holm's accent is hit-and-miss , but his truly unprintable favorite epithet for secondo actually gets funnier every time he uses it . it is this conflict which makes big night such a potent metaphor for cinema in the 1990s . what big night ultimately argues is that somewhere along the line , you have to choose between doing the work you know will make you proud and doing the work you know will make you rich . there is room for both , tucci suggests , but the greatest satisfaction comes from people loving the best you had to give them . but whether you see big night as a simple tale of brotherly conflict and fine dining or as a meditation on art as a consumer product , you should see big night , because film-making simply doesn't get much more satisfying . tucci , scott and company have put together a banquet of finely drawn characters , smart dialogue and assured direction , culminating in an elaborate meal which might inspire you to the same conclusion which leads one character to utter one of the year's best punch lines . it also ends with a wordless single take in which resolution is achieved with such grace , simplicity and emotion that you could find yourself smiling all the way out the door . "
1926,"it is the kind of situation you might have seen before played for laughs in low-brow comedies , usually because one of the parties in the bathroom is not the bride or the groom . in one astonishing moment , however , von trier shows that he is not going to take you anywhere you have been before , allowing his hand-held camera to linger on the face of a woman whose reaction is nothing as simple as lust or anxiety . it is nothing less than awe at the overpowering emotions of making love for the first time which plays out before us , and introduces us to one of the most utterly fascinating film characters i have ever seen , played by an actor of unbelievable range . there is not an emotion she does not touch , or which does not leave you fumbling for superlatives . watson is so good that her performance might overwhelm a lesser story made by a lesser film-maker , but breaking the waves is no simple love story . that storyline alone would make breaking the waves a risky venture , but von trier takes it to another level of audacity by making it an exploration of love and religious faith at its most extreme . it is powerful , resonant , and not a little bit sacrilegious . and breaking the waves is nearly as likely to offend those of a liberal sensibility as those more conservatively inclined . those whose knees would jerk at the mere notion of a woman who would sacrifice anything for her man are going to have major problems with breaking the waves , yet the film's indescribable final shot may address outrage on both sides with wordless daring : our earthly notions of good and evil , of right and wrong , may be burdens that only a simple mind motivated only by love can overcome in order to know the will of god . breaking the waves , at once intellectually challenging and emotionally draining , is presented by lars von trier in a visual style he also used in the kingdom , a film-to-video-to-film trick which renders everything a dirty brown . that structure , along with the jittery photography , are as much a key to the title of breaking the waves as anything which occurs in the film . lars von trier takes his audience for a ride on a sea of emotions which cannot leave it unmoved . love it or loathe it , you will not be able to ignore breaking the waves , or the work of emily watson as a woman who proves that love is a mighty power . "
1927,"billy bob thornton has presented me with a wonderful dilemma in sling blade : i don't know where to begin praising him . there are writers who get a shot at directing films , and actors who do some writing , and film-makers who take the occasional turn in front of a camera , but in most cases you can tell you are watching a writer direct , or an actor write , or a director act . in sling blade , you never feel as though you are watching a writer try to act , or an actor try to direct . you realize you are watching a natural born story-teller who understands that the words , the performers and the images are not discrete elements , but indivisible parts of a cohesive story . his setting , an insular southern town , is rendered with a vivid combination of characters and locations ; his characters , down to the last minor player , are given personalities uniquely their own . but it is the remarkable dexterity with which thornton weaves the threads of his story that makes sling blade so powerful . karl's story is heart-breaking because he always is striving to do the right thing , but it is terribly hard for him to get his mind around what that right thing is supposed to be . playing someone with a mental or emotional handicap is one of the most treacherous assignments in acting ( right up there with playing an alcoholic ) , because it is so easy to nail the character's twitches without nailing his soul . the former can be achieved through technical proficiency and a gift for mimicry , with dustin hoffman in rain man and geoffrey rush in shine as a couple of showy recent examples . neither of those roles , however , showed us a character trying to grow as a person , and that is what thornton accomplishes in sling blade . while thornton does turn in an exceptional physical performance , which his polite demeanor and quirky speech patterns , he does not allow karl to be defined by the way he talks . this isn't a character you feel sorry for , like a pet ; this is a man you feel for as a fellow human being . thornton the director draws similar superb performances from his entire cast , particularly dwight yoakam ( yes , _that_ dwight yoakam ) as the cruel doyle . he is casually chilling as he mixes insults and threats with chuckles and expressions of endearment as though incapable of telling the difference , and we can see the pathetic man behind the monster . complexities spill over from sling blade , a film so perfectly crafted and acted from the moment karl leaves the hospital that i wish thornton had reconsidered the first fifteen minutes . it is an awkward conceit which gets sling blade off to an uneven start , but it is just as well thornton demonstrated imperfection as a director . with the kind of flawless work he does as writer and star of sling blade , he might have become positively insufferable if he had directed a perfect film as well . "
1928,"the two main characters in neil labute's in the company of men -- the best american film to appear this year , and the best film _likely_ to appear -- do some of the most vicious things screen characters have ever done without weapons . you may walk into in the company of men expecting it to be about the cruelty of men towards women . you'll walk out realizing it is about cruelty in every possible permutation . it is a testimony to labute's talent as a storyteller that he allows us to see the damaged humanity beneath the despicable things his characters do . matt malloy's howard , who seems to be the kinder of the two , simply has a more benign pathology . then there is chad , a startling creation rendered with creepy nonchalance and savage humor by aaron eckhart . it would be easy to read chad as a simple sociopath ; it would also be the least interesting reading . his every action is a pre-emptive first strike of rage -- at women , at his co-workers , at the world -- designed to keep everyone off-balance through the bald-faced exertion of power . labute employs notably static composition throughout in the company of men , the kind which might be written off as the work of a rookie film-maker who hasn't discovered his visual style . i can't imagine a more fitting style for this story . for all their barely-diluted bile , chad and howard are essentially creations of their world , a corporate culture of claustrophobic cubicles , water cooler back-stabbing and mundane line-ups at the copy machine . labute's shots cage his performers , observing their panicked movements from a distance as though they were zoo animals . there is no room for morality in the company of men ; the concept is a luxury for those who still feel human . in the company of men is caustic enough that it's not always a pleasant experience , but it's hardly like taking medicine , either . labute's brilliant script and eckhart's star-making performance as chad create some of the year's most hilarious moments , even if the laughter is born of disbelief as frequently as delight . in fact , chad is so charming that there is bound to be consternation over his portrayal , concern that he could be viewed as a cutthroat role model . how sad if there were even a glimmer of truth to such perceptions . neil labute has unveiled the horror of an environment of gross selfishness turned toxic -- it's objectivism rendered as psychosis . watching in the company of men is like watching a car wreck between ethics and primal urges , one from which it's almost impossible to look away . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line "" subscribe "" .
